TITLE: How do you get someone out of your head?

POST: Hi,
I'm 22, and I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.

Problem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.

We decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. 

Now, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that. I would like for those feelings to go away, to leave me alone. But I can't.  

What do I do? It's been 3 months now, and I'm just desperate.

TL;DR: I have feelings for someone else, my girlfriend knows, and I'm desperate to get those feelings out of my head.

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Honestly, it's not about getting the feelings out of your head, it's about being honest with yourself and your girlfriend. You need to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on and what you want. It's not fair to her to keep this secret and not be honest about your feelings. You need to decide what you want and be willing to have a tough conversation with your girlfriend."
2. **u/Redditor12345**: "I think you're trying to suppress your feelings instead of dealing with them. You need to acknowledge that you have feelings for this person and that it's okay to have those feelings. You don't have to act on them, but you can't just ignore them either. You need to have a conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on and what you want. It's not fair to her to keep this secret and not be honest about your feelings."
3. **u/throwaway321**: "I think you're in a situation where you need to take some time to reflect on your feelings and what you want. You can't just expect to get over these feelings overnight. You need to take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to do to make it happen. You need to have a conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on and what you want. It's not fair to her to keep this secret and not be honest about your feelings."

TITLE: So, my mom woke me up with a loud TV.

POST: She was in her living room, watching TV. This was at about 8:30 in the morning, and she was exercising. She turned the TV up extra loud to hear it over her excercycle, and woke me up. I went in there asking for her to turn it down. She said she didn't have to; I explained that I always used headphones so she didn't have to deal with my noise and that she should give me a little more respect, given that I paid rent at the time.

She disagreed. I went back to my room, rather pissed off at the lack of equality. I had no lock on my door; but I had a dresser right next to it, so I pulled one of the drawers out enough so that it caused the door to not be openable. Then, I turned my speakers up really loud and blasted Gangnam Style on repeat, with the bass cranked up as high as it could go.

If you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song. I personally don't mind it. But here's the thing about my bass; it vibrates the walls, making one hell of a lot of noise. Needless to say, my mom was not pleased and shut off the internet. But it was oh so worth it.

TL;DR: My mom woke me up with loud TV, I got mad, and I got petty revenge by blasting Gangnam Style on repeat with the bass cranked up.

---

This post is a great example of petty revenge, as the author takes a small annoyance (being woken up by loud TV) and escalates it into a larger, more annoying situation (blasting loud music with a vibrating bass). The author's use of humor and self-awareness ("If you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song") adds to the entertainment value of the post. The fact that the author's mom shut off the internet as a result of the revenge adds an element of surprise and escalation, making the story even more engaging. Overall, this post is a great example of how petty revenge can be both humorous and effective.

TITLE: My girlfriend (20f) of two years cheated on me (20m) by kissing two guys at a Halloween party.

POST: Lately her and I have been having a few problems, and these problems have been brought up before a few times. One problem being that I don't show enough affection. I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.

For Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.

We both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it. It makes me sick to my stomach. Should I even try to fix it or would I be better off cutting all ties.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on me by kissing two guys at a Halloween party, says she did it because she felt wanted. I love her but it makes me sick to my stomach. Should I try to fix it or cut ties?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like your girlfriend is looking for attention and validation elsewhere because she's not getting it from you. You need to work on being more affectionate and showing her that you care. If you can't do that, then maybe you're not the right person for her."
* "I think you're being too harsh on yourself. You're not perfect, and neither is she. Everyone makes mistakes. The question is, are you willing to work through this and move forward, or are you going to let it tear you apart?"
* "I don't think you should be with someone who cheats on you, even if it's just a kiss. You deserve better than that. You need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being."
* "It's not just about the cheating, it's about the fact that she felt the need to do it in the first place. If she's not feeling fulfilled in your relationship, that's a bigger problem than just one night of cheating."
* "You need to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what you're willing to work on and what you're not. If she's not willing to work on being more honest and open with you, then maybe you're not compatible."
* "I think you're being too focused on the cheating and not enough on the underlying issues. You need to work on communicating with your girlfriend and figuring out what's really going on in your relationship."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are varied, with some people advising the OP to work on being more affectionate and showing his girlfriend that he cares, while others think that the OP should prioritize his own feelings and well-being and cut ties with his girlfriend. Some people suggest that the OP and his girlfriend need to have a real conversation about what they're willing to work on and what they're not, while others think that the OP is being too focused on the cheating and not enough on the underlying issues in the relationship. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to try to fix the relationship is up to the OP and his girlfriend, and it will depend on their individual circumstances and what they're willing to work on.

TITLE: One year post-pregnancy, aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help?

POST: I'll try to keep this short!

**Background**

* I've always been an on again/off again (very casual!) jogger, typically doing 3 - 5 k
* My knees have always been finicky, and I went to a physio who thought I had "runner's knee"
* Pre-pregnancy, my "runner's knee" would flare up when I got to the 8 - 10 k distance range, even if I had a decent base (doing a C210k type program)

**Current Problem**

I had my baby a year ago, so all in all I haven't run for about 1.5 years.  I'm quite slim and have been doing aerobics-style classes for the past year, so I'm not totally out of shape.  Body weight exercises, aerobics, bikes and ellipticals are all fine.  However, when I run even the tinyiest bit, or even go on a long walk or a hike, my pelvis gets very sore and tight, and my knees start hurting very quickly.  I already am doing general squats/lunges/stretching type things.  

I'm starting to feel like running just isn't for me anymore. Which is a bummer, because I really enjoy running!

Has anyone had something similar? Can anyone recommend some stretches or exercises that might help?  Should I see a Dr?  Or should I just see a physio?  Not quite sure how to proceed.

Thanks!

TL;DR: One year post-pregnancy, experiencing aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help!  Has anyone else had similar issues?  Any stretches or exercises that might help?  Should I see a Dr or physio?  Thanks!  [Edit: added more details]

**Comments**

1. **u/runningnewbie**: "Hey OP! I had a similar experience after having my baby. I think it's common for women to experience pelvic floor issues after childbirth. I would recommend seeing a physio who specializes in postpartum care. They can help you with exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor and glutes, which can help alleviate the pain. Additionally, you might want to consider a gynecologist or OB-GYN to rule out any underlying issues. As for running, it might be worth starting with shorter distances and gradually increasing your mileage. You might also want to try incorporating strength training exercises to help stabilize your knees."
2. **u/runnergirl88**: "I had a similar experience after having my baby, and it took me a while to get back into running. I would recommend seeing a physio who specializes in postpartum care, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, you might want to try incorporating exercises that target your core and glutes, such as squats, lunges, and deadlifts. These exercises can help stabilize your pelvis and alleviate the pain. As for running, it might be worth starting with shorter distances and gradually increasing your mileage. You might also want to try incorporating strength training exercises to help stabilize your knees."
3. **u/fitnessmotivation**: "Hey OP! I'm not a medical professional, but I've had similar issues after having my baby. I would recommend seeing a physio who specializes in postpartum care.

TITLE: TIFU by getting scared for no reason and peeing on myself

POST: (Pre-apology for formatting errors since i'm on my phone)

Well, this was embarrassing and happened a few minutes ago. 
I work at a small law office which shares a building with a few other businesses, a dentist's office and a military recruitment center. There is no drinking fountain in the building, so I bring a giant 2L water bottle which I sip on all day to keep hydrated and counteract all the copious amounts of alcohol i drink (after work, of course). Unfortunately, I have been cursed with a small bladder, and have to go pee sometimes 8-10 times a day. Luckily the back door of my office opens up right near the bathroom, so I can usually drain the main vein without embarrassing myself by being frequently seen there.

As I was wrapping up work for the day, I realized I would have to pee one more time before leaving. It was slightly after 5, so when I walked to the bathroom, I wasn't expecting to see anyone in there (it is the kind of bathroom with a urinal and a stall).

Fuckup begins when I open the door and there is a dude who had just finished shitting and was leaving the stall. For whatever reason this terrified me for a split second and I jumped and gasped. 

The guy was amused and chuckled and was like, did I scare you? I muttered something like "haha, yeah, a little bit" and I kept my head down, beelined to the urinal and unleashed the krakan. 

I was super embarrassed and very preoccupied so I didn't notice that the bottom part of my untucked, button-down shirt had slipped into my urine stream and was getting soaked. I didn't realize it until it began to sort of soak back onto my pant leg and getting my thigh wet. 

Well, fuck, i thought. This sucks. Then i remembered my fiancee was coming to pick me up straight from work so we could go grocery shopping. I cleaned up as best as i could, but its still very obvious. Luckily I have a P coat which is long enough to cover my pee-soaked netherregion, so i may get through this unscathed. My girl didn't notice yet...

TL;DR: I got scared by a guy who just left the bathroom, peed on myself, and now I'm worried my girlfriend will notice. Help me, Reddit, you're my only hope!

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, that's a great story. I'm glad you're sharing it with us. I'm sure your girlfriend will understand."
* "I've had similar experiences, but I've never had to deal with a pee-soaked shirt. Good luck with the rest of your day!"
* "I'm dying over here. 'Unleash the krakan'? That's a great phrase."
* "I think you might be the first person to ever use the phrase 'pee-soaked netherregion' in a serious post. You're a legend."
* "I'm glad you're taking it in stride. It's not the end of the world, and your girlfriend will probably laugh about it with you."
* "I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. Well, not literally, but you know what I mean."
* "I think you should just own it and tell your girlfriend what happened. She'll probably find it funny and you'll have a good laugh about it together."
* "I'm surprised you didn't mention the giant 2L water bottle. That's a great detail."
* "I hope your girlfriend doesn't notice, but if she does, just tell her it's a new fashion trend: pee-soaked shirts are the new black."
* "I think you should start a support group for people who pee on themselves. You could call it 'Pee-ers Anonymous'."

TITLE: TIFU by staring too much.

POST: Unlike most tifu's I have seen, this happened today. So, to start off I am 16 years old and have started my second semester as a sophomore, in one of my new classes (team sports to be specific) I noticed a very attractive and genuinely cute girl. I have never been on dates or been romantically involved with any girls before, because I have social anxiety and I am pretty chunky and I have confidence problems because of it. Any way, back to the story, I notice this cute girl and I can't help myself and I stare at her then I gain focus and I am focused back on the game. The day continues normally until I look back and her eyes avert away from me quickly, like when you get caught staring at someone and you act like you weren't staring. So, I thought "does she like ME?!?" thought it might have been a coincidence but I caught her stare a few more times. So after we dress back into our normal clothes I stare at her and question. whether or not she could like a person like me. She caught my gaze this time and she turns away and talks to some dude. The dude was pretty weird but there wasn't a day when she wasn't talking to him during class. Anyway the dude gives me a dirty look and the bell rings and I thought maybe she doesn't like me maybe she was creeped out and told her possible boyfriend that I was staring at her all class. So yeah saw her walking away with the dude and I saw her eyes on me again and they avert again. Don't know her name or anything so probably creeped out the poor girl and might get confronted by the dude, also I seem like a total creep...
P.S. sorry for formatting on mobile.

TL;DR: I'm 16, have social anxiety and low self-esteem, and I stared at a cute girl in my class too much. She caught me staring a few times and now I'm worried I've creeped her out and might get confronted by her boyfriend. Help me out, Reddit! Should I try to talk to her or just leave her alone?

---

The comments are filled with people sharing their own experiences of being awkward around crushes, offering words of encouragement and advice. Some people suggest that the OP should try to talk to her and be honest about his feelings, while others recommend leaving her alone and focusing on building confidence and self-esteem.

One comment that stands out is from a user who shares a similar experience:

"I TIFU'd in a similar way when I was in high school. I had a huge crush on this girl and I would stare at her all the time. One day, she caught me staring and she looked away quickly. I thought I had blown it and I was going to get embarrassed. But then, a few days later, she came up to me and started talking to me about a project we were working on together. It turned out that she had been feeling the same way about me and she was just as nervous as I was. We started dating and it was amazing. So, don't give up hope! You never know what might happen if you just be yourself and be honest about your feelings."

This comment helps to put the OP's situation into perspective and reminds him that it's okay to make mistakes and that there's always a chance for things to work out. The OP's post and the comments that follow show that even in the face of awkwardness and uncertainty, people can find support and encouragement online.

TITLE: Reddit, I think our family dog just consumed a significant amount of chocolate. What do I do?

POST: Okay so my father and I went out to dinner tonight and left the dog at home. I'd left half a bar of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz, still in the wrapper) sitting on my desk. Mind you, the bar has been sitting on the desk for about three days now and the dog hasn't done anything about it, and typically doesn't. She knows not to climb on surfaces and has shown no interest in the candy before. 

However, I returned home to find my bedroom in shambles. The contents of my desk were all knocked around and a bunch of family photos were all shredded and chewed up. I found the empty chocolate bar wrapper on the ground and still can't find the offending candy. I can only conclude that the dog has eaten it.

This is something that my dog would've done as a puppy. However, she's ten now and hasn't behaved like this in years. She's acting fine at the moment, but I'm still worried. My father doesn't seem concerned about her at all, which worries me even more.
FYI, my dog is a dachshund mix and weighs about 25-30 pounds. 
Has anybody been in this situation before? What happened? Does anybody know what to do?

TL;DR: My 10-year-old dachshund mix ate a significant amount of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz) and I'm worried about her. Has anyone been in this situation before? What did you do? Should I be concerned?

---

**Comments:**

* "Oh no! I've been in a similar situation before. My dog ate a whole bag of Hershey's Kisses. She ended up vomiting a few times, but otherwise seemed fine. I took her to the vet just in case, and they said it was a good thing I did because the chocolate was causing her blood sugar levels to drop. They gave her some activated charcoal to help absorb the toxins, and she was fine after a few hours. I'd definitely take your dog to the vet ASAP, just to be safe."
* "I'm not a vet, but I've heard that dark chocolate is way worse for dogs than milk chocolate. The higher the cocoa content, the more toxic it is. I'd be worried about your dog's heart rate and blood pressure. Have you noticed any changes in her behavior or physical condition? If she's acting fine, that's good, but I'd still take her to the vet just in case."
* "I've had to deal with this before too. My dog ate a whole bag of peanut butter-filled Kongs, and I was worried sick. But the vet said that as long as she didn't show any signs of distress, she'd be fine. They gave her some Benadryl to help with any potential allergic reactions, and she was good to go. Just keep an eye on her and make sure she's not showing any signs of chocolate poisoning. If you're still worried, take her to the vet, but it's possible she'll be okay."
* "I'm no expert, but I've heard that you can try giving your dog some milk or yogurt to help counteract the effects of the chocolate. Has anyone else heard this? I'm not sure if it's true, but it might be worth a shot."
* "I'd definitely take your dog to the vet, just to be safe. Chocolate poisoning can be serious, and it's always better to err on the side of caution. Even if your dog seems fine, the vet can still check her out and make sure she's okay. And if you're worried about the cost, many vets offer emergency appointments for situations like this. It's better to be safe than sorry."

TITLE: Me and my (former) best friend.

POST: I'm a 15-y.o. female, and I'm pretty sure that I just lost my long-time female best friend (a year older), who has been with me for about 4 years.

I had only two friends in school, and'she' was one of them. We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.

In the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say "no", as always, without looking me in the eye.

And now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done. I don't have much friends. Now that I am in a new university, I could simply forget that part of my past and move on, but I cannot bring myself to do so. You can't just forget years of shared experiences, right?
 

Hell, I even dream about her sometimes. I adore her as a great friend, no less. But in those last few days together, she'd just blatantly ignore me, and wouldn't at least tell me what I've done wrong--and that really hurts me. I'm rarely emotional, but look at me now.

Any help at all would be strongly appreciated. If it's me who's at fault, do tell--I'm open. Apologies for the long post.

TL;DR: I lost my best friend of 4 years, and I have no idea why. She ignored me for weeks, and then blocked me on social media. I'm devastated and can't move on. Help me figure out what went wrong.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're really hurting. I think it's great that you're open to hearing what might have gone wrong, but I also want to remind you that sometimes people just drift apart, and it's not always because of anything you did. It's possible that your friend was going through her own stuff and didn't know how to deal with it. Have you tried reaching out to her again, or is that not an option for you?
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think it's great that you're willing to take responsibility for your actions, but I also want to remind you that you can't control how others behave. If your friend was ignoring you and wouldn't tell you what was wrong, that's not your fault. It's possible that she was dealing with her own issues and didn't know how to communicate with you about it. Have you considered talking to someone about how you're feeling? A therapist or a trusted adult might be able to help you process your emotions and move forward.
3. **u/throwaway789**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling, and I want you to know that you're not alone. I've been in similar situations before, and it's hard to move on from. But I want to remind you that you are worthy of love and friendship, and you deserve to have people in your life who care about you. Don't give up on yourself, okay? You're strong and capable, and you can get through this.
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think it's great that you're reflecting on your actions and wondering if you did something wrong. But I also want to remind you that you can't control how others behave, and sometimes people just make mistakes. It's possible that your friend was going through a tough time and didn't know how to deal with it. Have you considered talking to someone about how you're feeling?

TITLE: TIFU by trying to creatively announce my first pregnancy.

POST: This happened a couple months ago. My husband and I spend most of our time working in the overseas, and we recently came home to the U.S. for a year to apply for another long term visa. We decided that we should spend that year trying to have our first baby.

Within a week after making this decision, I realized I had missed my period. The next week I took three pregnancy tests at work, and that's right, my Mexican ass is knocked up. Instead of telling my husband right away, I came home from work and made a cookie cake that said "I Got Knocked Up" and a bunch of cupcakes with letters on it that, when unscrambled, say "I am pregnant." 

Here's the FU part. Since we spend a lot of time overseas, we don't have many close friends, but we had a few people we had begun hanging out with and I invited them all over that night to play Settlers of Catan. When my husband got home that night, they were all there waiting with the board set up. I brought out the cupcakes I made and told them all to unscramble them. My husband stared at the cupcakes for a minute and said, "I am pregnant." All our new friends were super excited, but my husband just sat there dumbstruck.

Finally, one of our friends stopped and asked my husband, "Dude, are you just finding this out right now? Ohhh Shit." My husband and I went into our room for about a half hour and he was pretty upset that he didn't know first and we didn't decide together how to tell people, and how he was put on the spot in front of practical strangers. But then we made up, cried, called our parents, and then rejoined our awkward guests for a game of Settlers.

TL;DR: I got pregnant, made a cookie cake and cupcakes to announce it, and accidentally told my husband in front of our new friends. He was upset, but we made up and it all worked out in the end.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that my husband and I are still together, and we're actually having a great time being parents. And we're still good friends with the people we told that night. It was a weird experience, but it's all good now. And I learned that sometimes it's better to just tell your partner first before announcing it to the world. 

---

TITLE: Knee pain due to poor balance

POST: I've had difficulty with distance running due to strong knee pain. My endurance is great, I can cycle for very long distances, but I can't run because my knees give out around 8 to 10 mies.
I went to the Orthopedist who did a full series of x-rays and pronounced my knees in excellent condition. Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and "hip stability" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.
So, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?

TL;DR: Knee pain due to poor balance, Orthopedist says hip stability is the issue, looking for affordable balance exercises to do at home.

RESPONSES:

* "Hey OP, I had similar issues with my knees and it was due to poor balance and hip stability. I started doing single-leg squats and lunges, and also worked on my core strength. It took some time, but it really helped. You can also try doing some balance exercises like standing on one leg or doing balance boards. There are also some great YouTube channels that have balance exercises you can do at home. Good luck!"
* "I had a similar issue and it was due to overpronation. I got orthotics and started doing exercises to strengthen my ankles and feet. It really helped. You might want to consider getting your gait analyzed to see if you're overpronating or supinating. Also, try doing some calf raises and toe curls to strengthen your ankles."
* "I had knee pain due to poor balance and hip stability, and it was caused by weak glutes. I started doing glute bridges and hip thrusts, and it really helped. You can also try doing some single-leg deadlifts and step-ups. Make sure to focus on proper form and engage your core. Also, try to strengthen your ankles and feet by doing exercises like toe curls and calf raises."
* "I had a similar issue and it was due to tight IT band. I started doing exercises to loosen it up, such as foam rolling and stretching. It really helped. You can also try doing some hip flexor stretches and glute stretches. Make sure to warm up before running and do some dynamic stretching afterwards."
* "I had knee pain due to poor balance and hip stability, and it was caused by weak core. I started doing planks and side planks, and it really helped. You can also try doing some Russian twists and leg raises. Make sure to engage your core and keep your shoulders down. Also, try to strengthen your ankles and feet by doing exercises like toe curls and calf raises."

These responses offer a variety of exercises and suggestions that can help improve balance and hip stability, which may alleviate knee pain. They also provide some affordable and accessible options for exercises that can be done at home, such as single-leg squats, lunges, balance boards, and calf raises. Additionally, they suggest getting a gait analysis to identify any issues with overpronation or supination, and strengthening the glutes, ankles, and feet through exercises like glute bridges, hip thrusts, toe curls, and calf raises. Overall, these responses provide a range of helpful and affordable options for improving balance and hip stability, which may help alleviate knee pain.

TITLE: I'm (18M) jealous of other guys flirting with my (18M) girlfriend on social media. Help?

POST: My jealousy is starting to become a problem in this relationship. Actually, it has always been. Last year, a boy my girlfriend was friends with had kept walking her to class, writing her cute notes (something boyfriends do) and asking her if she's sure about being with me. I threatened to break up with her if she never stopped talking to this guy, because he was obviously trying to make a move. Now that she's in college, she's hanging out with more guys! 75% of her friends are guys, always hanging out with her, and after the "friend" she had last year, I can't stop being jealous or mad about her friends. The social media part about this, guys put heart eyes on her photos on instagram, and I tell them to back the fuck up, and my girlfriend gets mad at me for confronting them! "You don't know what they meant by them, it doesn't mean they're flirting with me." I understand that she is right, she doesn't respond back but she obviously likes the attention she gets. My jealousy is also fueled by my friend group. My friends have dated my exes, I've been apart of closed door conversations about how some of my friends want to fuck my other friend's ex, visa versa. I would never do that to my friends, and in my world, most guys in college or highschool just want to take my girlfriend if they hang out with her. Or want to fuck her. She has already encountered a guy trying to flirt, and she gave him her number just to talk when we were arguing and on a break from our relationship. I have influenced her as well to be jealous with how i act with my anger and jealousy, but a big break up caused her to stop being clingy. Now i'm stuck being mad and jealous towards guys around her, and now I feel overprotective.

TL;DR: I'm 18M, my 18F girlfriend is in college, and I'm jealous of guys flirting with her on social media. I've always been jealous, and it's causing problems in our relationship. I feel like I'm overprotective, and I don't know how to deal with it.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your relationship. You're not going to be able to control who your girlfriend talks to or who puts heart eyes on her photos. You need to focus on building trust and communication with your girlfriend instead of trying to control her. Also, it's not healthy to be jealous of every guy who talks to your girlfriend. You need to work on your own insecurities and trust issues."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're misunderstanding what flirting is. Flirting is not about wanting to take someone away from their partner, it's about showing interest and having fun. If your girlfriend is getting attention from other guys, it's not because they're trying to steal her away from you, it's because they're interested in her as a person. You need to focus on building a stronger connection with your girlfriend instead of trying to control who she talks to."
3. **u/jealousy_is_a_problem**: "Dude, you're not going to be able to control who your girlfriend talks to or who puts heart eyes on her photos. You need to focus on building trust and communication with your girlfriend instead of trying to control her. Also, it's not healthy to be jealous of every guy who talks to your girlfriend. You need to work on your own insecurities and trust issues."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're misunderstanding what a healthy relationship looks like. A healthy relationship is built on trust, communication, and mutual respect. If you're feeling jealous and controlling, it's because you're not getting those things from your girlfriend. You need to focus on building a stronger connection with your girlfriend instead of trying to control who she talks to."

TITLE: I [22 F] want to buy my bf [28 M] of 6 months a $500 very rare video game for his collection for his birthday/Christmas. Will a gift of this caliber scare him off/ be considered too much after being laid off from his game dev job?

POST: My boyfriend's birthday is December 24th, which is Christmas Eve. He grew up in a foster home and never got great presents for either his birthday or Christmas. He often spends his birthday and Christmas alone because his foster mother is uninterested and he doesn't have a great relationship with his birth mother. 

He spent Christmas with me last year, so I went out of my way to get him both a birthday present AND a Christmas present, both of which valued above $50. However, he was so thrilled to have someone to spend his birthday and Christmas with, he showered me with 5 very nice, expensive gifts. I felt terrible. Happy, but terrible.

He is a video game artist but was recently laid off from his job. He is very passionate about his video game collection. There is one game I noticed in his collection that he only has the sequel of. I asked him why because it is very unlike him. He said it was because the original was wildly expensive and he already had a hard time affording a mint condition version of the sequel.

The cheapest, mint condition version of the game I could find is about $500. I do not make a whole ton of money, but I have saved up enough for it but now I find myself having second thoughts. I would have to buy it now or within a few months because the price skyrockets the closer it gets to Christmas. We haven't been together all that long (about 6 months) and I don't know if it would be right to drop $500 on a present just yet.

I have so many questions. Is this too much? Would it be creepy to get him something that he never asked for? What if giving him a game gives him bad feelings about getting laid off? What if we break up before Christmas and I am stuck with the game? Would the game have the same value to his collection if he didn't earn it himself?

Any help would be great. I am torn.

TL;DR: I want to get my boyfriend a rare $500 video game for his birthday/Christmas, but I'm worried it might be too much, especially since he just got laid off from his job. I'm also concerned about the potential value of the gift if we break up before Christmas. Should I get it or not?

---

This post is a great example of a relationship dilemma, where the OP is torn between their desire to show their boyfriend a thoughtful and meaningful gift and their concerns about the potential consequences of such a large and expensive gift. The OP is worried that the gift might be too much, especially given the boyfriend's recent layoff, and that it might give him bad feelings about his job loss. They are also concerned about the potential value of the gift if they break up before Christmas.

The post is well-written and provides a lot of context about the boyfriend's background and the OP's motivations for wanting to get him the gift. The OP is clearly thoughtful and considerate of their boyfriend's feelings, and is seeking advice on whether or not to go through with the gift.

The comments on this post are also very helpful, with many users offering advice and insights on the situation. Some users suggest that the gift might be too much, especially given the boyfriend's recent layoff, while others suggest that it might be a thoughtful and meaningful gesture. Some users also offer suggestions for alternative gifts that might be more suitable for the boyfriend's situation.

Overall, this post is a great example of a relationship dilemma, and the comments offer a lot of helpful advice and insights on the situation.

TITLE: I (16f) don't want my Boyfriend (16m) hanging out with his female friend anymore

POST: My boyfriend's been very close friends with this girl for a few years, and him and I have been dating for a year and a couple months now. I've never had a problem with their friendship and I know that it's platonic, they've never done sexual stuff or dated or anything. And she had a boyfriend throughout out entire relationship, but they broke up last Thursday. Since then she has been trying to talk to my boyfriend more and I'm worried that she wants to do stuff with him. I've hung out with my boyfriend twice since and both times he got several texts from her and she hardly ever used to text him while we've hung out before. And yesterday evening I called him and he was talking to her on the phone. All of a sudden since her boyfriend and her broke up now she's constantly trying to talk to my boyfriend? I think she likes him and I don't want them hanging out anymore, when he said he was talking to her on the other line I told him he's not allowed hanging out with her anymore and he seemed angry at me for saying that. Since that I've apologized and we aren't fighting now but I think he still talks to her. How do you think I could get them to stop their friendship without "telling him what to do"? Do you think that she wants to date him? Or why is she so obsessed with him now that she's single? I'm so upset and I'm worried about what will happen if they hang out with eachother now.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's female friend broke up with her boyfriend and now she's constantly trying to talk to him and I'm worried she wants to date him. I don't want them hanging out anymore and I'm worried about what will happen if they do. How can I get them to stop their friendship without "telling him what to do"?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is being pretty immature about the whole situation. If he's not willing to have a conversation with you about it, then maybe he's not the right guy for you."
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. Just because she's single doesn't mean she wants to date him. Maybe she just needs someone to talk to or hang out with. You're being pretty controlling by telling him he can't hang out with her anymore."
* "I agree with the first comment. Your boyfriend needs to have a conversation with you about this and figure out what's going on. If he's not willing to do that, then you need to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I think you should have a calm and rational conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Tell him how you're feeling and why you're worried. Maybe he's not even aware of how much she's been trying to talk to him. And if he still doesn't listen to you, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I think you're being pretty unfair to your boyfriend. He's not doing anything wrong. She's just trying to stay in touch with an old friend. You're being pretty controlling and it's not healthy for the relationship."
* "I think you should try to talk to your boyfriend's friend and have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she's not even aware of how much she's been trying to talk to him and maybe she can help you figure out what's going on. And if she's not willing to talk to you, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

Overall, the comments are divided on whether the OP is overreacting or not. Some people think that the OP is being controlling and that the boyfriend is not doing anything wrong, while others think that the OP has a right to be concerned and that the boyfriend needs to have a conversation with her about it. Some people suggest that the OP should try to talk to the friend and have a conversation with her about how she's feeling, while others think that the OP should focus on having a conversation with her boyfriend. The comments also touch on the idea that the boyfriend may be immature and that the OP may need to reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have a conversation with her about her concerns.

TITLE: My [[22m]] gf [[20]] of six months says things were going too fast and she's not capable of being with anyone right now.

POST: A little background. I met her this summer through her then boyfriend [[28]] of two years, who (as I learned later) treated her like shit, was generally abusive, cheated on her, and used violence on her. They were in a long distance relationship and see each other for about two weeks every two months. A few weeks later I invited her over for my birthday party, we got to know each other better and practically started dating (behind his back that is). Initially I didn't want to ruin their relationship but she said she no longer had any feelings for him and their relationship was going to an end. She broke up with him a few weeks later, when he came to visit her.

Our beginnings were pretty intense. We'd hang out every day, spend most of free time together, see each other almost every day and send dozens of messages every day as well. It came to a point where we practically started living together. About a month into our relationship she said that she loves me. I told her I developed feelings for her as well. We started having sex not so long after that.
Anyway, things were going pretty good for some time, until very recently, when the honemoon phase started deteriorating. I could feel someting was wrong with the way she acted towards me, she seemd sad and unhappy, so today I confroted her about it and what she said is basically that she thinks our relationship came too fast, that she feels bad about chating on her then boyfriend, and that I am a great guy (handsome, intelligent, romantic, good in bed, blah blah), but she thinks what she felt towards me was not love but affection and that this feeling is now gone. She also mentioned that she's used to being with someone significantly older, that I am way too good for her, that she is basically incapable of loving anyone right now and needs to be alone for some time. She didn't exclude being with me in the future though.

What should I do guys? I don't want to lose her, I love her.

(sorry for broken English, it's not my native language + I'm a bit drunk and devastated)

TL;DR: GF of 6 months says things went too fast, she's not capable of loving anyone right now, and I'm too good for her. She didn't rule out being with me in the future. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you two had a whirlwind romance, and it's no wonder she's feeling overwhelmed. Take some time to process this and don't be too hard on yourself. Remember that you can't force someone to feel a certain way, and it's not your fault that things didn't work out.
2. **skeptical_sarah**: I'm going to be honest, OP, it sounds like you two had a pretty intense and unhealthy relationship. You basically moved in together and started having sex within a few months? That's not a healthy pace. It's no wonder she's feeling overwhelmed and unsure about her feelings. Take some time to reflect on whether you're really ready for a serious relationship, and whether you're willing to work on building a healthier connection with someone.
3. **relationship_ruth**: OP, I think you need to take a step back and assess whether you're truly ready for a relationship. It sounds like you two moved too fast, and now you're dealing with the consequences. Take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want from a relationship. Don't be too hard on yourself, and don't try to rush back into things with your girlfriend. You deserve to find someone who is ready and willing to build a healthy connection with you.
4. **heartbroken_hank**: OP, I feel your pain, bro. It's tough to hear that someone you care about doesn't feel the same way. But you gotta remember that you can't force someone to love you, and you can't make them stay in a relationship if they're not happy. Take some time to grieve the loss of the relationship, and then focus on moving forward. You'll find someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are.
5. **practical_pam**: OP, I think you need to have a serious talk with your girlfriend about what she wants from a relationship. It sounds like she's not ready to commit to you, and that's okay. But you need to know what you're getting yourself into. Ask her what she needs from you, and what she's looking for in a relationship. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a relationship.

TITLE: Me [22m] with my girlfriend [19 F] of 1 and a half years, has been having communication and trust errors as of late

POST: Everything in our relationship up until about a month ago was fantastic.  We never fought, we understood each other and acted like the bests of friends and lovers through it all.  Recently, I went back to school and our communication has been a bit strained, since I didn't do so well in last semester and have been focusing more on my studies.  

Last weekend, I could tell something was definitely wrong.  She was constantly on the phone texting, conversation seemed strained and she seemed more engrossed with her phone and because of this there were problems during sex which made it not enjoyable at all.  We confronted each other and she told me she felt as if she doesn't feel as if we're in a relationship when I'm up here because I don't text as often as I used too.  

On my end, I'm worried because a new guy friend has come into her life and she seems to be putting more time into talking to this guy than to me.  I told her I would change and nothing was threatened in terms of a break up or anything, we both agreed we want this to last.  However, I can't shake this feeling that something is up and the more and more I think about it it makes me more and more paranoid and depressed. 

I just need someones outside opinion before I do anything or say anything irrational. I truly don't want my relationship to end with her, but with all the signs I'm getting, I just don't want to get dragged through the mud for months before something bad happens to me. 

Note-my girlfriend was a lesbian before I met her.  Failed relationships with men and a bad upbringing led her to hate men for a long time and I was the first guy she dated in years.  Doubt this has any relevance but I'm just trying to put all the facts out there.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 1.5 years have been having communication and trust issues. She feels like I'm not in the relationship when I'm focused on school, and I'm worried about a new guy friend she's been talking to. I'm feeling paranoid and depressed and need outside help to figure out what to do.

TITLE: 26[f] who has never had children or married, dating 30 year old man who has divorced and 2 children. Part 2.

POST: [Backstory]:( He has been divorced and has two children. I've never experienced any of those. I also realize that it takes a lot to be part of a broken family.

I don't feel that my emotional needs are being met. I feel like I'm always listening to his problems, but he never hears mine. He also likes to go to strip clubs, a lot, and has all of these women who just randomly give him their numbers, etc. I'm concerned about one friend in particular of his. He says she's just a friend, but he's admitted to me before that she has a crush and she has also text me from his phone pretending to be him before. He never did anything about it and got mad at me for "over reacting about it". 

Recently things have changed though. He's been calling every day and showing a lot of improvement. I want to fall for him, but I keep having that nagging feeling in the back of my head. I did tell him that we would give this "relationship" one last try and then just let it all go if it didn't work. Since then there hasn't been a lot of fighting and there hasn't been any issues with his "female friends".

I want to say I care about him, but I don't think he feels the same way towards me. He has made improvement, but it still just feels strange. I'm not sure where to go from here.

TL;DR: Dating a 30 year old man with two kids from a previous marriage. He's made some improvements, but I still have doubts about his feelings for me. He has a lot of female friends and has been to strip clubs. I'm unsure if I should continue the relationship or not.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being really understanding and giving him a lot of chances. It's great that he's made some improvements, but it's also important to prioritize your own emotional needs. Have you talked to him about how you feel? Maybe he's not aware of the impact his actions have on you."
* "I would say it's time to re-evaluate the relationship. You deserve someone who prioritizes your feelings and needs. It's not fair to keep putting yourself in a situation where you're constantly worried about his actions."
* "I think you're being too hard on him. He's made an effort to change and that's something to be appreciated. Maybe you're just not used to being in a relationship with someone who has been through a divorce and has kids. Give him a chance to prove himself to you."
* "I would say it's not just about his actions, but also about how he makes you feel. If you're constantly feeling anxious and unsure about the relationship, it might be time to re-evaluate. Have you considered couples therapy to work through some of these issues?"
* "I think you're being too focused on his past and not enough on the present. He's made improvements and that's something to be acknowledged. Maybe you're just not used to being in a relationship with someone who has a lot of female friends. It's not uncommon for people to have friends of the opposite sex, especially if they're not in a relationship."
* "I would say it's time to set some boundaries. If you're not comfortable with him going to strip clubs, then maybe you should have a conversation with him about it. It's not about controlling him, but about being honest about what you're comfortable with."
* "I think you're being too quick to judge him. Maybe he's just trying to have fun and not hurt anyone. It's not your place to police his actions. Focus on your own feelings and needs and see if this relationship is truly right for you."

TITLE: [28/f] Boyfriend [28/m] has skeletons and baggage from childhood, he's acting out. Break-up or help him?

POST: In short, i'm at a cross-roads. Bf of 2 years has a lot of personal stuff he needs to address. It's not stuff that will be fixed in one session of therapy. It's a lot of stuff. Until recently things have been fine. 

Now I'm finding that these issues are affecting how he acts in his relationship with me and others. Certain things that he has done recently have led to complete distrust, simply because he withholds information until I stumble upon it and bring "it" up. I literally have to make a case before he confesses to "it."

I dont know what to do. I don't necessarily think that mental health is a reason to break up IF THE PERSON IS WILLING TO PUT IN WORK. I do think a lack of trust is a reason to break up. BUT, when the actions that led to the lack of trust are bc of the mental state of the person I'm lost.

WHAT DO I DO????

TL;DR: Bf has a lot of personal issues from childhood, acting out in relationship. Withholds information, leading to distrust. Should I break up or help him work through issues?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you should take a step back and assess whether you're willing to be in a relationship with someone who has a lot of baggage. It's not fair to you to have to deal with the fallout of his childhood trauma. You deserve someone who is emotionally available and willing to work on themselves."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting you. Let him know that you're willing to support him in his healing process, but you need him to be honest with you and work on rebuilding trust."
* "I think you should consider couples therapy. It can be really helpful in addressing the underlying issues that are causing his behavior. It's not a magic fix, but it can be a good starting point for working through things."
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want from this relationship. Do you want to be with someone who is still working through their childhood trauma, or do you want to be with someone who is more emotionally available? You deserve to be with someone who is willing to work on themselves and prioritize your relationship."
* "I think you should try to be patient and understanding. It's not easy to overcome childhood trauma, and it's going to take time. But it's also important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. You can't fix his issues for him, but you can support him in his healing process."

These comments offer a range of perspectives and advice, from suggesting that the OP should break up with her boyfriend due to his baggage, to encouraging her to have an open and honest conversation with him and try to work through the issues together. Some comments also suggest seeking outside help, such as couples therapy, to address the underlying issues. Overall, the comments provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for the OP to share her concerns and receive advice and guidance.

I'm town.  Ita still a new fresh relationship and I've been told when someone shows you are the first time to believe them. But then again he has been through alot and crests it a couple months ago.  I don't knoe how to feel or what to do or how to handle it.  Please help!!!

TL;DR: BF created online dating profile 2 months after we became exclusive.  He says he doesn't use it, just browses, and is deeply sorry.  He's under stress with work and an ill parent.  He loves me and wants to work through this.  I'm torn and unsure what to do.

**Community Response:**

The community is divided on whether the OP should stay in the relationship or not. Some people believe that the boyfriend's actions are a red flag and that he is not fully committed to the relationship. Others believe that the boyfriend's stress and past experiences may have contributed to his actions and that he is genuinely sorry and wants to work through the issue.

Some common themes that emerge in the comments include:

* The importance of trust and communication in a relationship. Many people believe that the boyfriend's actions have broken the trust between the two of them and that it will be difficult to repair.
* The need for accountability. Some people believe that the boyfriend should be held accountable for his actions and that he should take concrete steps to prove his commitment to the relationship.
* The impact of stress and past experiences on relationships. Some people believe that the boyfriend's stress and past experiences may have contributed to his actions and that he is not entirely to blame.

Overall, the community is divided on whether the OP should stay in the relationship or not, and there is no clear consensus on what the OP should do. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the OP's own feelings and values, as well as her communication with her boyfriend and her ability to work through the issue together.

TITLE: I have begun treatment for adult ADD. I feel I have climbed out of Plato's cave. Now that my brain functions at its full capacity, I hunger for knowledge. Help me nourish my ambitions!

POST: A little background information:
My condition was overlooked until now (19) due to a combination of what I assume was my intelligence compensating for the deficit and an aversion to the idea of ADD/ADHD by a great part of my family.

I first became interested in ADD while talking to a friend about her condition and, upon further research, diagnosed myself; however, that is another story.

This thread isn't about ADD and I don't want ADD to be discussed on it.  My question stems from a new found ambitious drive and the fact that, while medicated, I am able to better access and apply my mind.  A lot of my current inspiration comes from the idea of a renaissance man, Edmond Dantes, and The Most Interesting Man in the World.

All being said, I humbly ask my fellow Redditors to answer a few questions:
(feel free to answer as many or as few as you please)

What do you wish you would have done  (to invest in yourself) when you were 18-22?

Name your top 3 books/philosophers/inspirational materials of all time.

Convince me why I should learn a specific language as opposed to any other.

Ladies of Reddit, what sort of learned habits/characteristics/hobbies/skills do  you find attractive in a Man?

What is a skill/subject I should dedicate some time to grow/learn about that will benefit me down the road?

What ideas/motifs should I attempt to avoid throughout my human experience?

Any other piece of information you would like to give me.

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with adult ADD and have started treatment. I'm now eager to learn and grow, and I'm seeking advice from fellow Redditors on how to nourish my ambitions.

TITLE: Me (22f) and boyfriend (21m) of 7 years moving in together for the first time across country

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years this November. We've been together since we were 14 and 15 and have never broken up. I would have liked to live together already at this point, but his parents have a rule that we cannot get engaged, married, or live together while he's in college. 

He's just about to start his senior year of college and he's already got job interviews lined up for the west coast. He would like to work on the East or West coast while I'm hoping for West. We currently live in the Midwest (USA) but in separate houses. We're both concerned that because we've never lived together a move across the country to live together might break our relationship. I suggested that we do couples counseling. I have been in therapy personally for my own issues for about a year and have found it very helpful. We've had big fights in the past where I've brought up couples counseling, but he doesn't want to go because he feels uncomfortable with it and thinks we can fix our problems ourselves. 

I think it would be beneficial to do preventative couples counseling for this school year before we make the big move. He seems slightly more open to it than he has before because he's concerned as well and feels unprepared for the future. We have been through so much together and we're on the same page about big things like religion and children. We have a very solid foundation and there is so much love between us. We just want to be as prepared as possible so that our relationship flourishes when we move in together for the first time. 

My question is has anybody gone through something similar and what would you recommend for us to be successful? Do you think couples counseling is a good idea for us? Please share your experiences and any advice you have! Thank you very much.

TL;DR: Me and my boyfriend of 7 years are moving in together for the first time across the country. We're both concerned about the potential challenges and think couples counseling could be beneficial. He's hesitant due to discomfort with the idea. Has anyone gone through something similar and what advice do you have?

**Responses:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I went through a similar situation with my partner. We were both in our early 20s and had been together for 5 years. We decided to move in together for the first time, but we were both nervous about it. We started couples counseling and it was one of the best decisions we ever made. It helped us communicate better, work through our issues, and prepare for the challenges of living together. I would highly recommend it for you and your boyfriend. It's not about fixing problems, it's about being proactive and building a stronger relationship."

2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I'm glad you're thinking ahead and wanting to prepare for this big change. Couples counseling can be super helpful, but it's not the only thing you can do. You and your boyfriend should also have open and honest conversations about your expectations, boundaries, and goals. Make a list of things you're both comfortable with and things you're not. This will help you navigate any conflicts that arise. Also, consider having a 'first fight' conversation, where you both agree to disagree and work through conflicts in a healthy way. Good luck!"

3. **u/longdistanceproblems**: "I've been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years and we're planning to move in together soon. We've been doing couples counseling online and it's been really helpful. It's not the same as in-person counseling, but it's still a great way to communicate and work through issues. I would recommend finding a counselor who is experienced in online counseling and has a good understanding of the challenges of long-distance relationships. Good luck with your move and your relationship!"

4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think couples counseling is a great idea, but I also think you and your boyfriend should have some individual therapy sessions as well. This will help you both process your own emotions and thoughts about the move and living together. It's not uncommon for people to feel anxious or overwhelmed when making big changes like this. Individual therapy can help you both work through those feelings and come out stronger on the other side."

5. **u/relationshipsuccess**: "I've been in a relationship for 10 years and we've been living together for 5. We've had our ups and downs, but we've always prioritized communication and working through our issues together. My advice to you and your boyfriend is to make time for regular date nights and activities that you both enjoy. This will help you stay connected and strengthen your bond. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's a friend, family member, or therapist, having a support system is crucial for a healthy relationship."

TITLE: [24/m] I am that controlling boyfriend.

POST: Actually, I was that controlling boyfriend. I noticed it, but thought that it was just a little phase I was going through because of stress at work, past relationship experience, blah blah blah; but really, it doesn't seem like that was it at all.

It was pretty bad. I'd make mountains out of molehills, volcanoes out of mountains, and could find any reason in my head to think that she was deceiving me. Part of my personality is very analytic and I have a good memory, which didn't help at all. She would tell me about her day or a story from her past, and if something didn't add up I would prod and say things like, "yeah, but you also said..." or "but wait, didn't you do..."

It was bad, all bad.

The worst part is that in my head, I was sure that I was really in love with her and wanted her to have freedom. But in the back of my head, I was worried that deception is everywhere and its never that easy. I would get so sure of myself, becoming condescending while I told her what she was *really* thinking or did. Then, she'd finally get the straight story through to me and I'd start bawling and apologizing. I swore up and down that it wouldn't happen again, but it always would. 

Well, the day after I called about enrolling in therapy, she dumped me. I deserved it 100% and I'm not here to ask how to get her back, because, frankly, it will never happen. But, I'm wondering what experience and insight I can find here to help me overcome this problem. I would like a healthy relationship in the future, but I am completely incapable of having one, as I am now.

TL;DR: I was a controlling boyfriend and I'm seeking advice on how to overcome this problem and have a healthy relationship in the future.

**Comments:**

* "Wow, it takes a lot of courage to admit to being a controlling partner. Kudos to you for recognizing your behavior and seeking help. I would recommend starting with self-reflection and understanding why you felt the need to control. It's not about being 'right' or 'wrong', but about understanding your motivations and working on building trust and communication skills. Good luck on your journey to becoming a healthier partner!"
* "I'm glad you're seeking help! Controlling behavior is a pattern that can be broken, but it requires effort and commitment. I would suggest working on building emotional intelligence, learning to recognize and manage your emotions, and practicing active listening and empathy. It's also important to recognize that your partner's feelings and needs are valid and important. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them."
* "I'm a therapist and I work with couples and individuals on relationship issues. I would recommend seeking therapy to work through your issues and develop healthier communication and relationship skills. It's not about 'fixing' yourself, but about becoming a better partner and person. You can also try practicing mindfulness and self-compassion to help you stay present and focused in your relationships."
* "I'm a survivor of a controlling relationship and I can attest that it's not easy to overcome. But it's possible! I would suggest taking small steps towards change, like practicing active listening and asking open-ended questions. It's also important to recognize that you don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. Remember that your partner's feelings and needs are valid and important, and that you can work together to build a healthier relationship."

TITLE: Pet lovers, how do you keep your home clean?

POST: Everyone has their favorite tricks/tips to keeping a clean house, so I'm curious...and in the market for a new vacuum and/or steam mop. 

We have three adult cats and one Italian Greyhound puppy and live in a mostly hard-wood apartment [two carpeted rooms and two large area rugs]. The cats are short hair but shed like crazy [black, white and grey!] and IGs don't really shed at all, but track in a decent amount of dirt from the yard. Getting sick of sweeping, swiffering and then pushing around dirt with a mop. It'd be nice to have a vacuum that picks up dirt and hair effectively on hardwood and carpet and I'm strongly considering investing in a steam mop.

So what do you do? What do you recommend?

TL;DR: Need help keeping home clean with 3 cats and 1 IG puppy. Looking for vacuum and/or steam mop recommendations.

COMMENTS:

* "I have a Dyson vacuum and it's been a game-changer for pet hair. It's also great for hardwood floors. I also use a steam mop on my tile floors and it's amazing for getting rid of dirt and stains."
* "I've had good luck with a Shark vacuum. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver, and it does a great job on both hardwood and carpet. I also use a Bissell steam mop on my tile floors and it's easy to use and effective."
* "I've been using a Hoover vacuum with a pet hair attachment and it's been working well for me. I also use a Swiffer steam mop on my tile floors and it's easy to use and effective."
* "I've tried a few different vacuums and steam mops and I've found that the best one for me is a combination of both. I use a Dyson vacuum for the floors and a steam mop for the carpets. It's been a great combo for keeping my home clean."
* "I've been using a robot vacuum and it's been a lifesaver for me. It's easy to use and it does a great job of picking up dirt and hair. I also use a steam mop on my tile floors and it's easy to use and effective."
* "I've found that the best way to keep my home clean is to do a little bit every day. I vacuum and mop regularly, and I also make sure to clean up after my pets right away. It's a lot easier to keep my home clean if I stay on top of it."

TITLE: How do I end a friendship even though they haven't done anything wrong?

POST: I am in a situation that I have dreaded, and since I can't sleep, I figured I would reach out.

I(24F) was friends with a group of guys in college my first two years- it was maybe the social circle I hung out with third most? They all lived in my same dorm community and I was pretty close to one of the guys because of our shared interest in video games. The rest of them I just enjoyed the company of and because they were in close proximity, we naturally would grab meals and hang out in the dorm. I don't think we ever went to any parties or any non campus based activity. I have since lost touch with most of them.

One of them attempted to get in touch a few months ago since we now live in the same city. It seemed like he had just gotten out of a relationship. I told him we could hang out when I wasn't busy with work. He reached out to me again a few weeks ago and I ignored him. I know I probably should have addressed this then. Now he has messaged me saying that he wants to know why the animosity between us and why I'm ignoring him.

He hasn't done anything wrong, I just don't have the desire or social capacity to continue a friendship. I often move from one social circle to the next and will maybe find one person I genuinely want to be life long friends with. I find myself stretched thin just keeping up with that handful of friends. I find most of my time spent with them, my SO and my two sisters, and they make me very happy. Some past friends have figured this out about me, and with others it is a gradual growing apart. I don't know how to handle someone trying to come back into my life uninvited. I also can admit that my concern the first time that he wanted to explore a possible romance opportunity and I was having none of that.

I don't think it makes me a bad person to not continue being friends with this person, but I don't know how to end the friendship without being an asshole. r/relationships, have you ever been in a similar situation? How do I respond to this person?

TL;DR: I don't want to continue a friendship with someone from college, but they haven't done anything wrong. I'm worried about how to end it without being an asshole. Help!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's okay to not want to continue a friendship just because. You don't owe anyone an explanation, but if you want to be kind, you could say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the effort, but I've been focusing on my current relationships and priorities have shifted.' Don't feel obligated to get into details or make excuses. Just be clear and direct."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your own limitations and boundaries. It's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. When responding to him, try to focus on the present and future, rather than dwelling on the past. You could say something like 'I appreciate the memories we shared, but I've been focusing on my current relationships and I don't feel like we're a good fit for each other right now.'"
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I think it's important to remember that you're not obligated to maintain a friendship just because it's been a certain amount of time. You've grown, changed, and your priorities have shifted. It's okay to acknowledge that and move on. When responding to him, try to be kind but firm. You could say something like 'I appreciate the effort, but I've been focusing on my current relationships and I don't feel like we're a good fit for each other right now. I wish you all the best, but I think it's time for us to go our separate ways.'"
4. **u/throwaway4567890**: "I think it's great that you're considering the other person's feelings. When responding to him, try to be empathetic but also clear. You could say something like 'I appreciate your interest in reconnecting, but I've been focusing on my current relationships and I don't feel like we're a good fit for each other right now. I hope you understand and I wish you all the best.'"
5. **u/relationship_expert**: "I think it's important to remember that you're not responsible for the other person's feelings or reactions. You've made your decision, and it's okay to stick to it. When responding to him, try to be firm but kind. You could say something like 'I appreciate your interest in reconnecting, but I've made the decision to move on and focus on my current relationships. I wish you all the best, but I think it's time for us to go our separate ways.'"

TITLE: Me [21/F] with my hookup [24/M] recently few months, Advice Hookup: Go after it or stay put?

POST: I've been friends with this guy that goes to college on the same campus as me for over a year. We would always catch up and hang out between classes, and even have some homework nights that would involve wine and getting our work done. I had always had a crush on him but he is so hard to read that I thought I was completely friend zoned.

It wasn't until one night I came back from the bars early and wanted to keep drinking that I asked if he was down to hang out and drink. I went over and we drank, talked and ended up watching episode after episode of a TV show. No moves were made this entire time. Then as it reached the early hours of the morning I fell asleep during one of the episodes and he woke me up to basically making out with me and hooking up.

After this I didn't know what to do so I just sort of waited for him to say anything and I think we were both in shock so I just got dressed and we swapped a few words and I dipped out. Just recently we hooked up again after he came to a kickback I threw and we went back to his apartment with friends to play some drinking games and then I went back to my place only to get an invite to come back down. After this hookup he's the one that left me and told me was only leaving bc he had to be up in 3 hours. But we never kiss or anything after its just put on clothes and awkwardly showing each other out the door.

His friends have been pushing me to go after him and saying that he's lazy in the fact that he can want something but never really goes out of his way to get things. He also has told his friends in front of me that you cant just be friends with girls and also be attracted to them and plan to hookup because it doesn't work that way. So should I try to go after it or just keep it how it is now? My friends tell me I'm the Ice Queen and I don't show enough interest.

TL;DR: I've been hooking up with this guy for a few months, we've never had a real conversation about our feelings, and I'm unsure if I should try to pursue something more or just keep it casual.

---

**Advice from the Reddit community:**

1. **Don't chase him**: "You've already had the conversation with him about how you feel, and he's not reciprocating. Don't waste your time trying to get him to commit. You deserve better than someone who's not willing to put in the effort."
2. **Communicate your feelings**: "Have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. Let him know that you're interested in something more, but you're not going to keep hooking up with him if he's not willing to put in the effort."
3. **Don't play games**: "Don't play games with him or try to make him jealous. You're not going to get what you want by playing games. Be honest and direct about your feelings."
4. **Focus on yourself**: "Instead of focusing on what he's not doing, focus on what you want and what you're willing to do to get it. Take care of yourself and don't settle for someone who's not willing to put in the effort."
5. **Don't be the "Ice Queen"**: "You don't have to show interest in someone who's not interested in you. You're not the "Ice Queen" for not pursuing someone who's not willing to put in the effort. You're just being smart and not wasting your time."

**Additional comments:**

* "It sounds like he's not interested in you as more than a hookup. Don't waste your time trying to change his mind."
* "You deserve someone who's willing to put in the effort to make you happy. Don't settle for someone who's not willing to do that."
* "Have you considered talking to him about what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship? Maybe he's not aware of your feelings or what you want."
* "Don't be afraid to walk away if he's not willing to put in the effort. You deserve better than someone who's not willing to work for you."

TITLE: Me [25F] with my friend [27F], she hasn't made an effort to hang out with me for about two months despite being friends for about 17 years. What should I do?

POST: I should preface this by saying that she lives about 5 minutes away from me, we've known each other for 17 years, but I don't know if she is choosing to drift away or is just naturally busy.

She hasn't made the effort to hang out with me for two months and had been declining hanging out with me to the point where we would only hang out on weeknight rather than the weekend.

She has a mom that has quite a few mental-health related 'issues' but I think the majority of her time has basically been spent with her boyfriend.

I feel like she's ditching me which is fine, but I don't know what I should say if she tries to reach out.  She has also stopped texting me and only sent me one text in the course of a month and a half...Should I end the friendship if she reaches out again?

TL;DR: Friend of 17 years hasn't made an effort to hang out with me for 2 months, stopped texting me, and only hangs out on weeknights. What should I do if she reaches out again?

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's been prioritizing her boyfriend and her mom's issues over your friendship. If she's not making an effort to hang out with you, it's okay to acknowledge that and move on. You deserve better than a friend who doesn't prioritize your relationship."
* "I would say that if she reaches out again, you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you value your friendship, but you feel like she's been neglecting it. Be specific about the changes you've noticed and how it's affecting you. It's possible that she's not even aware of how her actions are impacting you."
* "If she's only been hanging out with you on weeknights, it's possible that she's just really busy with work or other commitments. But if she's stopped texting you and hasn't made an effort to hang out with you for two months, it's likely that she's just not prioritizing your friendship. You don't have to end the friendship if she reaches out again, but you do need to set some boundaries and communicate your needs clearly."
* "It's okay to acknowledge that the friendship may be changing or even ending. You don't have to be the one to initiate the conversation, but you also don't have to wait around for her to make an effort. If you're not getting the attention and affection you need from the friendship, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and prioritize your own needs."

TITLE: Want to tell me the story of your life?

POST: Hey!
First off, sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.

I don't know if there is any kind of specific reddit for this, so please tell me if there is a better place to post.

I'm in college studing arts in Barcelona, and i'm doing an antropology work where i have to search someone to tell me the story of his life. I thought that doing this in the street could be quite troublesome, since people might not want to tell face to face some parts of their life, so i thought that reddit could help me, becouse of the anonymity of internet.

I'm not searching for an incredible and full of awesomeness fake story, i just want some real human, kinda detailed (around 2 - 3 pages), story. I know u might be just lazy, so don't even care about ortography or structure of the text; I'll have to translate it into spanish or catalan. I just want to ask for sincerity.

Needless to say, you will be appearing as anonymous.

TL;DR: I'm doing an antropology work and i need someone to tell me the story of his life. I thought that reddit could be a good place to do it, becouse of the anonymity. I'm not looking for an incredible story, just a real human story.

TITLE: Me[18F] with my partner [18M] together 1 year, thinking of moving in together

POST: We've been considering moving in together. We've really been growing in to our relationship, and despise our age have matured into it. I've had a lot of struggles through the year - including my father's death. He has not left me, or avoided me, but he supported me through it all.

We're both studying a bachelor at university (first year) - he has a decent paying job (about $400 a week), and I've been getting temporary jobs here and there (Currently working 2, and earning $500 week). If we register our relationship officially and move in together, we will both be eligible for about $400-500 of government assistance each. 

We are both ready for the challenge, and one way or another I am moving out of home. We won't be moving out until December-January, earliest. I will hopefully have a more permanent job, consistent.

I'm seeing a lot of positives to moving in together, it may help develop our relationship further and build a life. We're certainly not ready for kids or marriage or anything. Just moving in together, into a small house/flat for rent (which is pretty cheap in our town, I've looked into it).

So, money aside - I'm really focused on the good points, and I'm hoping I'm not overlooking a crucial point. Is there some dead obvious reason not to move in together? Or any good advice on handle the situation, assuming it does go through? Or good advice for figuring it out.

I want to move in with him. I want to cook with with him, and fall asleep beside him every night. I want to drag myself home after work, and have a cup of tea with him. I want to have those moments where one of us get grumpy because our assignment is due and it's not finished until 11.34pm... and the other stays up late enough to read it through that one last time before it's submitted. I want us to sort out our problems, make decisions together, and know we're in this for each other.

TL;DR: Considering moving in with my partner of 1 year. We're both 18, studying at university, and have a decent income. We're eligible for government assistance if we register our relationship officially. We're excited about the prospect, but want to make sure we're not overlooking any crucial points. Any advice or concerns would be appreciated.

**Top comments:**

* "You're 18 and already thinking about moving in together? That's impressive! Just make sure you're both on the same page about your goals and expectations. Have a conversation about what you want out of this living situation and what your expectations are for the future."
* "I think you're being really responsible about considering the financial implications. Just remember that moving in together can also bring new challenges, like learning to compromise and communicate effectively. Make sure you're both willing to work through any issues that come up."
* "I'm a bit concerned about the government assistance aspect. Are you sure you're eligible for it? And what are the implications of receiving it? You might want to look into that more before making a decision."
* "It's great that you're thinking about the pros and cons of moving in together. Just remember that it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. You've only been together for a year, and it's normal to want to take things to the next level, but make sure you're both ready for the commitment."
* "I think you're being really mature about this decision. Just make sure you're not putting too much pressure on yourselves to make it work. Remember that it's okay to take things slow and adjust as needed. And don't forget to prioritize your own needs and desires in the process."

TITLE: Dear Reddit, What silly/irrelevant/rediculous family miscommunications have lead to feuds lasting years?

POST: My Grandma and my aunt (her daugher-in-aw) haven't spoken to each other in years over a phone that didn't get hung up.  My aunt and uncle screen their calls and frequently do not return them-- one time, my grandma called and left a message then thought she hung up the phone.  A few minutes later-- my Grandma was talking with someone in her home and used the word "bitch"-- this was all recorded on my aunt and uncle's answering machine and my aunt assumed it was about her and hasn't spoken to nor seen my Grandma in upwards of 5 years.  My Grandma wants to reconcile and clear the air, but my aunt won't go near her, won't let her husband (G-ma's son) and kids go there, and avoids family events.  My Grandma is almost 85-- and I think this is rediculous.  Why waste time the time you have with somone?  Why continue to hold a silly grudge?  To complicate matters further, my grandma has a daughter who lives with her and likes to be in other peoples business-- I think she is also part of the problem here as she won't drop it either.  Grandma is innocent but has a daughter and daughter-in-law who won't grow up and drop it.

TL;DR: Grandma and aunt haven't spoken in years over a misunderstanding about a phone call. Grandma wants to clear the air but aunt won't budge. Grandma is almost 85 and thinks it's ridiculous to hold a grudge.

TITLE: Reddit, help me name a student-funded scholarship

POST: Hi reddit.  I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:
Each summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.

So, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.

OK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:
Nonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),

Social and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,

Triple Bottom Line Fund,

Socially Responsible Internship Fund.

See, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.

TL;DR: Help me name a student-funded fellowship program for MBA students at UC Davis that supports students taking unpaid internships with nonprofit, government, or socially/environmentally driven organizations.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: How about "Balance Fund"? It plays off the idea of balancing the three-legged stool and is short and sweet.
2. **u/financeguru**: I like "Social Impact Fellowship" - it's straightforward and conveys the purpose of the program.
3. **u/environmentalist**: What about "The Bridge Fund"? It suggests connecting students who are passionate about social and environmental causes with the resources they need to pursue their goals.
4. **u/marketingpro**: How about "The Offset"? It implies that the program is offsetting the financial burden of taking an unpaid internship, which is a key aspect of the program.
5. **u/philanthropist**: I think "The Catalyst Fund" is a great name. It implies that the program is sparking positive change and providing a catalyst for students to make a difference.

**Other notable comments:**

* **u/consultant**: I like the idea of "The Fellowship of the Unpaid" - it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it gets the point across.
* **u/nonprofitpro**: What about "The Social Sector Support Fund"? It's a bit longer, but it clearly conveys the focus of the program.
* **u/entrepreneur**: How about "The Impact Internship Fund"? It's short and to the point, and it emphasizes the idea of making a positive impact.

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community has provided a range of suggestions for naming the student-funded fellowship program. While there is no clear consensus, some popular options include "Balance Fund", "Social Impact Fellowship", "The Bridge Fund", "The Offset", and "The Catalyst Fund". Ultimately, the chosen name should reflect the program's purpose and values, as well as be easy to remember and pronounce. The OP can use these suggestions as inspiration to find the perfect name for their program.

TITLE: Not sure how I (24/m) feel about girl (22/f) that I've been dating for a month

POST: So I've been dating this girl for a month and on paper we are perfect for each other. On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.

However I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:

a) Am not really that interested in her. 

b) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. 

c) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.

d) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.

e) All of the above

TL;DR: I'm dating a girl who is perfect for me on paper, but I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her. I'm confused as to why this is and I'm not sure if it's because I'm not really interested, or if it's because of the impending move, or if it's because I'm still recovering from my ex, or if it's because I'm growing up and don't have time for infatuation.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're just not feeling the spark with her. It's okay to admit that even if you think she's a great person. Maybe take some time to reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship and see if she aligns with that."
* "I think you're overthinking this. You're 24, she's 22, and you're both adults. It's normal to not feel 100% infatuated all the time. Maybe try to focus on the things you do enjoy about her and see if that helps."
* "I think the impending move is definitely a factor. It's a big change and it's natural to feel uncertain about the future. Maybe try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see how she feels about it."
* "I think you're still recovering from your ex. It's okay to take time to heal and figure out what you want in a relationship. Maybe try to focus on yourself and your own healing process before jumping into something new."
* "I think you're just bored. You're 24 and you're used to being in relationships where you feel like you're constantly being pursued. Maybe try to mix things up and do some new things together to see if that sparks some excitement."
* "I think you're growing up and you're just not as into the idea of being in a relationship as you used to be. That's okay! Maybe try to focus on your own personal growth and see where that takes you."

TITLE: TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike

POST: I didn't hurt my head but I got injured in another way. So I rode a bike today, something I rarely do. I grabbed a helmet and put it on the handlebars of the bike. After riding for maybe a quarter mile the strap of the helmet which was hanging down near the wheel got caught in the front wheel. The bike immediately stopped moving and I flew over the handlebars. I landed (hard) on my knees, left arm, and hip. I have no idea how I didn't hit my head, but if I did this may have been a much more serious ordeal.

TL;DR: I didn't wear a helmet and it almost cost me dearly.

COMMENT 1: "TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike" is a great title. You should've seen the look on my face when I read it.

COMMENT 2: "I didn't hurt my head but I got injured in another way" is the most r/tifu thing I've ever read.

COMMENT 3: "I have no idea how I didn't hit my head, but if I did this may have been a much more serious ordeal." That's the most important part. You're lucky to be alive.

COMMENT 4: "You should've seen the look on my face when I read it." Same here. I was like "WHOA, HOW DID YOU NOT HURT YOUR HEAD?!"

COMMENT 5: "TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike" is a great title because it's so simple and yet so effective. It's like you're saying "I'm an idiot, but I learned my lesson."

COMMENT 6: "I didn't wear a helmet and it almost cost me dearly." That's the moral of the story. Always wear a helmet when riding a bike. It's not worth the risk.

COMMENT 7: "I have no idea how I didn't hit my head, but if I did this may have been a much more serious ordeal." That's the most important part. You're lucky to be alive.

COMMENT 8: "You should've seen the look on my face when I read it." Same here. I was like "WHOA, HOW DID YOU NOT HURT YOUR HEAD?!"

COMMENT 9: "TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike" is a great title because it's so simple and yet so effective. It's like you're saying "I'm an idiot, but I learned my lesson."

COMMENT 10: "I didn't wear a helmet and it almost cost me dearly." That's the moral of the story. Always wear a helmet when riding a bike. It's not worth the risk.

TITLE: I[F21] showed my boyfriend [M21] some vacation photos I had taken with my black boyfriend few years back. He got mad and is ice cold towards me right now.

POST: I was showing my boyfriend photos from Greece when I was there a few years ago. he is a big history buff so we cuddled in bed and looked through the photos. I was there with my black boyfriend so he was of course in a lot of those photos. my new boyfriend asked who he was and when I said it was my ex-boyfriend he replied with a pained "oh ok" so we stopped looking at photos and watched some netflix instead.

he got really quiet and didnt want to cuddle anymore, he just sat and read a book. after a few hours i just had to ask
him what was up with his reaction to the photos with my boyfriend?

He said something like "why would you even date me? if you like black guys so much why don't you date black guys? what's the point of being with me? im not your type" 

I didn't even know I had a type. I just thought he was cute and nice so we dated. He didn't like my answer, got upset, we fought and he left.

I don't really understand his reaction, it was actually very shocking. He has never come off as racist in the year I have known him, more like the opposite. He is a really sweet and fun guy and this was very out of character for him.
that was a week ago now and he didnt text me once. nothing. at first i expected an apology but got nothing so i started texting him and he is really distant and cold in his responses. i ask him what I did wrong and he doesnt answer me and avoids the subject. 

i ask him if he wants to break up and he said no and then stopped responding. what the hell is up with him?

TL;DR: boyfriend got mad when I showed him photos of my ex-boyfriend, a black guy, and accused me of not being attracted to him because I like black guys. We fought and he left, and now he's being distant and cold towards me.

**Community Response:**

The community is shocked and upset by the boyfriend's reaction. Many users express their support for the OP and share their own experiences with racism and microaggressions.

* "This is not okay. He's being racist and you deserve better. Don't waste your time on someone who can't handle your past relationships."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault that your ex-boyfriend was black. You're an amazing person and you deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are."
* "This is a classic example of internalized racism. He's projecting his own biases onto you and using it as an excuse to justify his own insecurities. You're not the problem, he is."
* "I'm so glad you're speaking out about this. It's important to call out racism and microaggressions when we see them. You're not alone and you're not to blame for his reaction."

Some users also offer advice on how to handle the situation:

* "Don't give up on him just yet. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how his reaction made you feel. If he can't apologize and work through this, then it's time to move on."
* "Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being. You don't deserve to be treated like this. If he can't respect your past relationships, then he's not the right person for you."
* "Don't be afraid to set boundaries and communicate your needs. If he's not willing to listen and work through this, then it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

Overall, the community is supportive and encouraging, urging the OP to prioritize her own well-being and not to settle for someone who can't accept her for who she is.

TITLE: Me [21 M] seeing [Late 30's M], is it weird?

POST: So basically I've been hanging out with this guy who is in his late 30's. Almost a 20 year age difference. He looks great and seems like an okay guy but I feel like if I was in his situation I wouldn't even look at someone as young as me. It makes me think that he's strange to want to even talk with someone who is in a completely different stage of their life and are naive about a lot of aspects of life that he's experienced. He's come on pretty strong and I can make this into something if I want to. So what do y'all think, does he have issues? Using me for sex? Or can someone who is older and has dated with that much of an age gap explain why he would date that much younger

TL;DR: 21M dating 30'sM, 20 year age gap, feels weird, is he weird or just looking for companionship?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for older men to date younger women. It's not weird in and of itself, but it's definitely something to consider. Has he been open with you about his intentions and what he's looking for in a relationship? If he's being genuine and respectful, it might not be a big deal. But if he's just looking for a trophy or a way to feel younger, that's a different story."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think it's great that you're taking the time to think about this and consider the potential issues. It's always important to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in a relationship. Have you talked to him about your concerns and how you feel about the age gap? If he's willing to listen and work through your concerns, that's a good sign. But if he's dismissive or defensive, that might be a red flag."
3. **u/olderwoman**: "As an older woman who has dated younger men, I can tell you that it's not always about using someone for sex or feeling younger. Sometimes it's about finding someone who shares similar interests and values, regardless of age. That being said, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your intentions and expectations. If you're both on the same page, it can be a great relationship. But if there's a power imbalance or one person is using the other, that's a problem."
4. **u/agegapromance**: "I've been in an age-gap relationship myself, and it's not always easy. But it can also be incredibly rewarding. The key is to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings, desires, and expectations. It's also important to respect each other's boundaries and differences. If you're both willing to work through the challenges and be patient with each other, it can be a great relationship. But if there's a lack of respect or understanding, it can be difficult to make it work."

**Conclusion:**

The comments in this post highlight the importance of communication, respect, and understanding in any relationship, regardless of age. While some people may view an age gap as unusual or even problematic, it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. Ultimately, it's up to the individuals involved to decide whether the relationship is right for them and to work through any challenges that may arise. The post also encourages the OP to consider their own feelings and boundaries, and to prioritize their own needs and desires in the relationship.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my college friend [19 F] about 1 month, I wanna hang out with her but I don't have a car.

POST: This is the link for an earlier thread I posted about her 

She basically doesn't have any friends and will spend all her spring break at home playing video games. I wanna hang out with her, but both of us don't have a car. I live with my grandma 10 minutes away from her house. Would it be weird to ask her to spend a day with us playing video games and eating pizza?

 Another thing I could do is ask her to go see a movie with me, but I would just meet her there since I'll be going with a bike. Do you guys think it's okay to do that? I also have 0 experience with girls. You can say this is the first girl in my life.

TL;DR: I wanna hang out with my college friend who has no friends and will spend spring break at home, but we don't have a car. I live with my grandma 10 minutes away from her house. Should I ask her to spend a day with us playing video games and eating pizza? Or should I ask her to go see a movie with me and meet her there?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Dude, it's not weird to ask her to hang out. It's actually really sweet that you're thinking of her. Just be honest with her about not having a car and see what she says. Maybe you can even offer to walk or bike with her to your grandma's place.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: I think it's great that you're thinking of ways to hang out with her! Asking her to spend a day playing video games and eating pizza could be a fun and low-key way to spend time together. Just make sure you're respectful of her boundaries and don't pressure her if she says no.
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: I think it's a bit weird to ask her to spend a day at your grandma's house, especially if you're not sure how she feels about your grandma. Maybe start with something smaller, like asking her to meet you at a coffee shop or something? And yeah, it's totally normal to have 0 experience with girls, we've all been there!
4. **u/collegekid**: Dude, you're being super considerate of her feelings and that's awesome. I think asking her to go see a movie with you and meeting her there is a great idea. It's a low-key way to hang out and you can still have some quality time together. Just make sure you're not expecting anything romantic or anything, just a friendly hangout.
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: I think it's really sweet that you're thinking of ways to hang out with her, even though you don't have a car. It shows that you're willing to put in effort to make things work. Just be genuine and respectful, and I'm sure she'll appreciate it. Good luck, OP!

**OP's Response:**

Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll go with the movie idea and see how it goes. I'll make sure to be respectful and not expect anything romantic. I'll also try to be more considerate of her feelings and boundaries. Thanks again for the help!

TITLE: Fast way to regain stamina after a run?

POST: Hey /r/running, 

Last week my teacher told me the school was organizing a run. Everybody has to take part in a 20 minute run, which is part of an 8-hour relay with everyone from the school. Or if you would like to you can form a group of 6 people and run the full 8 hours with them. 

Kind of jokingly I asked a friend of mine if he would like to do the full 8-hour run, he said yes, then someone else said she wanted to join our group, and now we're going to do it... We've decided it would be best to run in segments of 10 minutes so everyone will run eight times for ten minutes. 

Here's the thing though, my condition is not that good, at all. Last Thursday I ran 1,8km in 13 minutes and 28 seconds (8,03km/h) and today I ran 2,33km in 14:23 (9,72km/h). There are two things I would like to ask: 

-What would be a good strategy to improve my stamina so I'll be able to run for a longer time? 

-After I'm done with the first 10 minutes of running, how will I be able to regain stamina as quickly as possible (~50 minutes) to run the next 10 minutes, and then again.

I'm 16y/o, the run will be in two weeks, do you think it's possible? I just keep telling myself to just do it :)

TL;DR: I'm going to run 8 hours with my friends in 2 weeks. I'm not in good condition, but I want to improve my stamina. What's a good strategy to improve my stamina and how can I regain it quickly after a 10-minute run?

---

**Comments:**

* "Hey, 8 hours is a long way! First of all, congratulations on taking on this challenge. To improve your stamina, I would recommend increasing your running distance gradually over the next two weeks. Try to add 1-2 km to your runs each week. Also, make sure to incorporate rest days and stretching exercises to avoid injury. As for regaining stamina, you can try to do some light cardio exercises like jumping jacks or jogging in place during your breaks. This will help get your heart rate back up and your muscles warm again. Good luck!"
* "I'm a bit skeptical about the 8-hour run, but hey, it's a great challenge! To improve your stamina, I would suggest incorporating interval training into your runs. This means alternating between high-intensity running and low-intensity running. For example, you could run at a high intensity for 2 minutes, then walk for 1 minute. Repeat this pattern for the duration of your run. As for regaining stamina, you can try to do some dynamic stretching exercises like leg swings and arm circles. These will help get your blood flowing and your muscles warm again. Also, make sure to stay hydrated and fueled during your runs."
* "I'm not sure if 8 hours is a good idea, but hey, it's your decision! To improve your stamina, I would recommend incorporating strength training into your routine. This will help build up your endurance and overall fitness level. You can try doing squats, lunges, and deadlifts to target your legs and glutes. As for regaining stamina, you can try to do some light cardio exercises like jogging in place or jumping jacks during your breaks. This will help get your heart rate back up and your muscles warm again. Also, make sure to stay hydrated and fueled during your runs."
* "I'm a bit concerned about the 8-hour run, but hey, it's a great challenge! To improve your stamina, I would suggest incorporating hill sprints into your runs. This means finding a hill and sprinting up it at maximum intensity. Then, walk or jog back down to recover. Repeat this pattern for the duration of your run. As for regaining stamina, you can try to do some dynamic stretching exercises like leg swings and arm circles. These will help get your blood flowing and your muscles warm again. Also, make sure to stay hydrated and fueled during your runs."

**Post Edit:**

The OP edited their post to add more information and clarify their question.

* "Hey /r/running, I just wanted to add that I'm not really used to running long distances, and I'm worried that I might not be able to keep up with my friends. I'm 16y/o and I've only been running for a few months. I've been trying to increase my distance gradually, but I'm still not sure if I'm ready for an 8-hour run. Can anyone give me some advice on how to improve my stamina and how to regain it quickly after a 10-minute run? I'm really nervous about this, but I don't want to back out now."

POST: Hi All, 

So I was totally into this girl but it is finally fizzing out. I've pretty much been in denial about the whole thing since we've "broken up" but it's finally now catching up to me because she's seeing someone else now. Friends and family still talk like she's my girlfriend. I know it wasn't healthy just pushing it away for so long but I need to face the music.

My family basically treated her like family because they liked her so much. I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this? 

Idk maybe I'm just kind of venting. This sucks.

TL;DR: Ex of 2+ years is moving on and seeing someone else. I'm still in denial and need advice on how to break the news to family and get back in the game.

* **u/throwaway123456**: Dude, I feel you. I went through something similar a few years ago. It's tough to accept that the person you thought was "the one" is moving on. But you gotta face the reality and move on too. Don't be afraid to reach out to friends and family and have an open conversation about how you're feeling. They'll understand and support you. As for getting back in the game, just put yourself out there and be open to new experiences. You never know what might come your way.
* **u/sadpanda1990**: I'm so sorry to hear that, OP. It sounds like you're really struggling with this. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to move forward. Just remember that it's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. Don't rush into anything or try to replace her too quickly. You deserve to heal and find someone who's right for you.
* **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think you're being really brave by acknowledging your feelings and wanting to move on. It's not easy, but it's necessary for your own growth and happiness. As for breaking the news to your family, I would suggest having a calm and honest conversation with them. Let them know that you're okay and that you're ready to move on. They might be surprised, but they'll come around eventually. And hey, who knows, maybe they'll even be happy for you when they see how happy you are with someone new!
* **u/throwaway456789**: OP, I'm a bit of a cynic, but I think you're being a bit too attached to the idea of your ex. I'm not saying she wasn't a great person or that you didn't have a good relationship, but it's clear that she's moved on and you need to do the same. Don't be afraid to take a step back and re-evaluate what you want in a relationship. You might be surprised at how much better you feel when you're not holding onto something that's no longer serving you.

TITLE: (SOMEWHAT URGENT) Training a worker that doesn't respect my authority.

POST: I got in to work today to find that I will be training someone to take over someone else's shift.

I've only been here an hour and so far, he's shooed me away from things, taken things out of my hands, interrupted me to boss customers around, and every time he does something the owner would kill him for (i.e. using the wrong soap or cups) I would let him know how he was supposed to do it, to be cut off by "yeah yeah yeah, I know how to do it."

Hes apparently worked at a different location previously and has forgotten a lot but insists on doing everything himself. When I try to tell him I need him to do something else he flat out says 'no.' Hes been in a phone call for the last 15 minutes.

Its just his first shift. I know I have to put my foot down. But how do I do so without starting an argument? I'm stuck here with him until 10 and will probably be training him again after today, but I need to make it clear that he DOES have to listen to me sometimes.

TL;DR: New worker doesn't respect my authority, interrupts me, and refuses to listen. How do I assert my authority without starting an argument?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* "Just be direct and assertive. Tell him 'I'm the one training you, and I need you to listen to me.' If he continues to disrespect you, don't hesitate to escalate the issue to your supervisor or HR."
* "Remember that you're not there to make friends, you're there to do a job. Don't take his attitude personally and focus on getting the job done."
* "Try to find a way to make it a team effort. Instead of saying 'you're doing it wrong,' say 'let's do it this way together.' This can help him feel more included and less resistant to your guidance."
* "It's okay to set boundaries and be firm. You don't have to be friends with this guy, but you do have to work together. Just be clear and concise about what you need from him."
* "Consider having a conversation with your supervisor or HR about the situation. They may be able to provide guidance on how to handle the situation or even reassign the training to someone else."
* "Don't let him get away with disrespecting you. If he continues to interrupt you or refuse to listen, calmly but firmly tell him that you need to be able to communicate effectively and that his behavior is not acceptable."
* "Remember that you're not alone. If you're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, don't hesitate to reach out to a colleague or supervisor for support."

**ADDITIONAL TIPS FROM THE OP**

* "I think I'll try to focus on the tasks at hand and not get too worked up about it. I'll also try to find ways to make it a team effort, like you guys suggested."
* "I'll also make sure to keep my supervisor informed about the situation and see if they have any advice or guidance."
* "Thanks for all the advice, guys! It's really helpful to know that I'm not the only one who's dealt with this kind of situation."

TITLE: I'm a dumb [21] male and so I'm having a lot of trouble interpreting the signals that this [21] girl may or may not be sending me. A little help please?

POST: So okay, I'm from New York but I study in Oregon for most of the year. Recently a friend of mine who I was not really close started facebook messaging me, that was about 3 months ago, since then we've talked almost everyday. She even asks when we can skype all the time and insists we do so and keep in touch. This sort of came out of the blue so naturally I just assumed she was into me. I can't really date her given that we live across the country, but I would if I could, she's really great in my opinion. Anyways we continue to speak to each other as usual and then last week I returned to new york for a break and so given that she and I share a group of friends I was hoping we could hang out together with them all for the little time where we're both in the same town. I tried to do just that but she totally gave me the cold shoulder; not being really responsive to hanging out, leaving early when we finally did etc...

Am I wrong in my original assumption that she was into me just because out of the blue she started talking to me a lot? Is she trying to play hard to get? Am I looking way too into this and maybe she was just occupied that weekend?

I really have no idea how to evaluate this. Do any of you guys have any suggestions/ideas?

TL;DR: Girl I've been talking to on Facebook for 3 months, we've been talking almost every day, she asks to Skype and hang out. I assume she's into me, but when I try to hang out in person, she gives me the cold shoulder. Am I reading too much into this?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not dumb at all. It sounds like you're just trying to make sense of a situation that's got you confused. I think it's great that you're taking the time to think about it and consider different possibilities."
* "I think you're giving her too much credit. Just because she's been talking to you a lot doesn't mean she's into you. Maybe she's just bored or looking for someone to talk to. Don't read too much into it."
* "I think you're right to assume she might be into you, but maybe not in the way you're thinking. Maybe she's just looking for a friend or someone to hang out with. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out, just be happy you have someone to talk to."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she's not interested in you romantically, but she still values your friendship. It's better to know where you stand than to keep guessing."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just relax and enjoy the conversation. If it's meant to be, it'll happen. If not, then you'll know and can move on."

**Discussion:**

The comments on this post are generally supportive and encouraging, with many users offering words of wisdom and advice. Some users suggest that the OP is reading too much into the situation and that the girl may not be interested in him romantically. Others suggest that he should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about his feelings. Overall, the discussion is helpful and informative, with many users sharing their own experiences and insights. The OP seems to be grateful for the advice and is considering the different perspectives offered. The post is a good example of how the r/relationships community can provide helpful and supportive advice to those seeking guidance on their relationships.

TITLE: TIFU by Burning my Butthole with Cayenne Pepper

POST: So I recently found out I have scabies on my legs and stomach. 

I made a doctors appointment for treatment next week, but I figured maybe I would find some natural remedies to at least help a little because the itching was unbearable. Turns out among the tea tree and neem oils, bathing in apple cider vinegar, you could also soak the affected areas with a cayenne pepper bath. I guess the pepper literally burns the surface mites. 

Desperate as I was, I set up a bath with everything: threw in the oils, vinegar, and a fuck ton of cayenne pepper. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but I fully immersed myself in the water. I was soaking and scrubbing my legs for a few minutes when I felt a strange sensation. I paused for a moment, then yelped in pain and jumped straight out of the bathtub. My downstairs was fucking SEARING...on both ends.

I quickly drained the tub and tried to rinse out both my lady parts and butthole, but to no avail. Peeing helped a bit, but there is some definite bleeding in my backside and the burn is killing me. 
It's been about twenty minutes. As I type I lay on my bed with an ice pack on my ass, trying to ride this one out hoping it goes away.
I'm such an idiot.

TL;DR: I tried a cayenne pepper bath to help with scabies, but forgot to test the temperature and ended up burning my butthole and lady parts. I'm currently lying on my bed with an ice pack, hoping the pain subsides.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by burning your butthole with cayenne pepper. That's a new one."
* "I think you might have just set a new record for most creative way to hurt yourself."
* "I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure you're supposed to add cayenne pepper to food, not your genital area."
* "I hope you learned your lesson and will never try to self-medicate with cayenne pepper again."
* "I'm dying over here. This is the most epic fail I've ever seen."
* "You know what they say: 'when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.' But when life gives you scabies, make a cayenne pepper bath...and then regret it."
* "I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that you managed to burn your butthole or the fact that you're still typing with an ice pack on your ass."
* "I think you might need to re-evaluate your life choices. Like, seriously, what's next? Trying to cure your scabies with a blowtorch?"



This post is a great example of the "TIFU" subreddit, where people share their stories of how they managed to mess things up in their lives. In this case, the OP (original poster) tried to use cayenne pepper to help with scabies, but ended up burning their butthole and lady parts. The comments are filled with people making fun of the OP's mistake and offering words of advice and caution. The post is a great example of how the "TIFU" subreddit can be a place for people to share their embarrassing moments and learn from each other's mistakes.

TITLE: Has anyone ever felt sexual chemistry with someone the second time around but not the first?

POST: Backstory: I'm 22 (f) and a few days ago, on our third date, I finally had my first kiss/other shenanigans with someone I like very much.  But I didn't feel much - in fact I was rather bored and disappointed with the apparent discrepancy in our emotional and sexual reactions to making out.  A couple of days later I very grudgingly broke it off because I figured that's that - no sexual chemistry, and I didn't want to string him along.  But I really want this to not be the case because I rarely (obviously being 22 and only having just had my first kiss) meet guys whom I like quite like this.  Maybe it was just so new that I couldn't appreciate it and a second go-round would prove more lady-boner inducing?  Maybe sexual chemistry can pop up (har har) after developing more of an emotional connection?  Or maybe I'm just grasping at straws, and if it were possible to give it another shot I'd just put us both through more disappointment.

TL;DR: Had a lackluster first kiss, but now I'm wondering if a second go-round could spark some sexual chemistry. Has anyone else experienced this?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I've had this exact experience! With my current partner, we had a pretty lackluster first time, but the second time around was like a whole different person. We'd developed more of an emotional connection, and it was like our bodies just clicked. It's possible that it takes a little time to develop, or maybe you just need to find the right moment. I'd say give it another shot, but only if you're both on the same page and willing to communicate openly about what you want and need."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Girl, I feel you. I've had the opposite experience - I had crazy chemistry with someone the first time, but it fizzled out after a few dates. It's not always about the initial spark, though. Sometimes it takes time to build up that chemistry. If you're really interested in this guy, I'd say give it another shot, but don't be afraid to communicate your needs and boundaries. And honestly, if it doesn't work out, it's okay to move on and find someone who's a better match for you."
3. **u/relationship_guru**: "I think it's great that you're thinking critically about this! It's not uncommon for people to have different levels of chemistry at different times. It's possible that you just needed a little more time to develop your emotional connection with this guy, or maybe you were just feeling a little nervous or unsure the first time around. If you're willing to communicate openly and honestly with him, I think it's definitely worth giving it another shot. Just remember to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, and don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't feel right."

**Original poster's response:**

"Wow, thank you all so much for your thoughtful responses! I really appreciate the honesty and advice. I think I'm going to take your words to heart and give it another shot, but with a more open and honest approach. I'll make sure to communicate my needs and boundaries with him, and we can work together to build up that chemistry. Thanks again for the support and advice - it means a lot to me!"

TITLE: I(17F) am hoping to move out of my pregnant, abusive, mothers house and in with my boyfriend (18M) after I turn 18. He still lives at his parents house, what can I do to make them more likely to agree to this situation?

POST: As the title says I need to move out of my house. My current living situation is not healthy and most days more often than not I cry for at least an hour because of my mother and how she treats me. She is also pregnant. I made a post awhile ago about this and my current situation for those of you who read this and it sounds familiar. 

My boyfriends parents have briefly offered before but I don't know if they were serious or not... We plan to ask them at some point soon, they do not know that my current home life is as bad as it is and I'm contemplating telling them when we ask if it would be a possibility.

 As a bit of a background my boyfriends older brother got a girl pregnant his senior year in high school and she lived with them for a long time(they have since moved out) she was lazy, created messes and basically left her kid with them so she could go do whatever it's is that she does. I would be coming into their home at least looking for a job but hopefully already having one, with a license (she didn't have one, only recently got one) and car, a high school graduate (she dropped out), in an abusive home, in college, plus I cook and clean which she never did. I'm really hoping these things will swing them in my favor. Also I would only be living there for around a year or a bit longer but not by much. Please no relationship judgement, I know we are young but this is pretty much my only option and we love each other dearly. 

His parents are a bit strict and weary of having another grandchild. That would work against me. At this point we aren't supposed to be in a room alone, if this happened that would be common.... 
Also we've been together over a year.

TL;DR: I'm 17, pregnant, and abusive mother, boyfriend 18, wants to move in with him after I turn 18. His parents have offered before, but I don't know if they were serious. I'm worried about telling them about my current home life, but I think my positive qualities (job, license, car, high school graduate, cooking, cleaning) could help. His parents are strict and wary of having another grandchild, and we're not supposed to be alone together. We've been together over a year.

TITLE: [19/m] About to meet girl [19/f] for the first time after months of online/text chat. Anyone have similar experience? Please share.

POST: Almost a year ago I met this girl on a online site and since then we have text almost every day and spoken on the phone a number of times. I don't know why we have never skyped, none of us have ever brought it up. We have however exchanged pics/videos so I'm 99.9999% she isn't some stranger from Ghana.

Anyway we've hit it off really well and I get on with her unlike anyone else I've ever spoken too. We come to eachother for advice and we have quite a good sense of eachothers personalities. Now recently she said she is going somewhere and with a bit more conversation this may end up being our first meeting as I've been looking to go somewhere and she suggested that I go with her as at least she'd roughly know someone. 

She is an incredibly nicest person and we have spoken about past relationships, she said she isn't one to judge and I've spoken/seen people she has been out with before and she herself described them as "not exactly lookers", so I'm not afraid of her seeing me and being like "what kind of creature are you" as I'm not exactly overweight or hard to look at. I am however still incredibly nervous that we may not get along, why I have no idea. 

I'm not looking for advice on what to do I am however hoping that some here have been in a similar situation and how it ended up?

TL;DR: Meeting girl I've been talking to online for the first time after months of chatting. Anyone have similar experience? How did it go?

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I've been in a similar situation before. I met a girl online and we talked for months before meeting up in person. It was actually really nerve-wracking for me, but it ended up being a great experience. We hit it off even better in person and have been together for a few years now. Just remember to be yourself and don't put too much pressure on the meeting. It's just a first date, and it's okay if it doesn't work out. Good luck!

COMMENT 2:
I've been in a similar situation too. I met a girl online and we talked for weeks before meeting up. I was really nervous, but it ended up being a great experience. We had a lot in common and it was easy to talk to each other. Just be yourself and don't worry too much about what she thinks. It's okay if it doesn't work out, but it's also possible that you could hit it off even better in person. Good luck!

COMMENT 3:
I've never been in a situation like this before, but I've heard that it's common for people to feel nervous when meeting someone they've met online.

TITLE: Cold applying for a marketing position in a small local company by attaching a proposal for their business website. Feasible idea?

POST: Hello /r/jobs, I graduated a few months ago and had no luck so far to get a job in marketing/sales. 

There's a small local company (perhaps 30 employees) but they are actually pretty successful in what they're doing (known worldwide). I checked their website and it's awful. Looks like a website from the early 2000's. So I guess they are not pretty good in (online-)marketing. 

I would like to do a cold application (not sure if they are looking for a marketing guy) but I had no luck with this kind of application in the past. That's why I thought I try something different. I have good skills in photoshop, indesign and illustrator. As a teenager I also built websites using HTML, so I thought I build a dummy website fitted to their company and attach some screenshots to my application.

What do you think? I this a feasible idea or will they be offended?

Thank you very much in advance.

TL;DR: I'm trying to get a job in marketing/sales, but no luck so far. I found a small local company with a terrible website and I want to do a cold application by attaching a proposal for their business website. Is this a feasible idea or will they be offended?

**Comments:**

* "I think it's a great idea! Show them that you're proactive and willing to take initiative. Just make sure the website you create is professional and doesn't look like a student project."
* "I'm not sure if it's a good idea. They might see it as an invasion of their space or an attempt to show off. Maybe try to get in touch with them first and ask if they're open to feedback or suggestions?"
* "I think it's a good idea, but make sure you're prepared for the possibility that they might not be interested in your proposal. Don't get discouraged if they don't respond or if they don't like your idea."
* "I think it's a great way to stand out from other applicants. Just make sure you're clear about what you're proposing and how it will benefit their company."
* "I'm not sure if it's a good idea. They might see it as an attempt to show off your skills rather than a genuine interest in the company. Maybe try to focus on your skills and experience instead of trying to show off?"

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you for all the comments! I think I will go ahead with my idea, but I will make sure to be professional and clear about what I'm proposing. I will also make sure to highlight how my proposal can benefit their company. I will also be prepared for the possibility that they might not be interested in my proposal. Thank you again for your help!

**Conclusion:**

The original poster is considering a cold application to a small local company with a terrible website, by attaching a proposal for their business website. The comments are mixed, with some people thinking it's a great idea and others being more cautious. The original poster decides to go ahead with the idea, but will make sure to be professional and clear about what they're proposing. This post is a good example of how to get feedback and advice from others in a subreddit, and how to approach a cold application.

TITLE: My boyfriend (34F) gave me an ultimatum, I realized it's a deal breaker for me(29F). He's still a good person and I'm lost on how to proceed with the breakup.

POST: We've been together three years. He has a degree (communications), tried to go back for another (more useful) one and got burnt out. He works a dead end job now, but is happy, which is important to me. But I'm also frustrated because I feel like I have more responsibilities in our relationship. I carry him on my insurance, pay for our car (which I do use more), make our house budget/cleaning chart and am trying to save up for a house for us.

For two years, he told me this job was temporary while he figured out which direction he wanted to go with his career. Last night he sat me down and told me he needed to give me an ultimatum (his words, "I don't mean it to be one, but it is"). He knows his job isn't what I want him to be doing but he's okay with it. He appreciates that I've been trying to support him figuring it out, but he's going to stop that and just live in the moment....for now. He knows himself and when he figures it out, he'll be passionate and dive in. 

At the time, I was relieved to hear him tell me straight up.....but after a night of sleep and a day to digest everything he said, the full weight is sinking in. This is a deal breaker for me. I respect his reasons (personal happiness is really important) and wish him well (he's a good person), but I've never been in this spot before. All my past relationships ended with fireworks, drama, tears.... this feels very "we both are in different places." 

Our lease is up at the end of June. Do I say something now? Wait until a month out? All these feelings just hit me on my lunch break and I'm starting to panic! I know it will be a hard breakup in the sense that we both love one another and neither did anything wrong, but that just knots my stomach even more! I don't want to make him feel guilty.

TL;DR: My boyfriend gave me an ultimatum to stop supporting his career growth and just live in the moment. I realized it's a deal breaker for me, but I'm struggling with how to proceed with the breakup. We both love each other, but I don't want to make him feel guilty. Help!

This post is a great example of how to share a personal story in a respectful and concise manner. The author provides context about their relationship, the ultimatum, and their feelings, making it easy for readers to understand their situation.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] brokeup after 2.5 years this week and I'm having urges to start talking with her again

POST: Sorry in advance for the wall of text this seems to be! I didn't' mean for it.
Earlier this week, my ex dumped me because she said she couldn't be a good student (we are both in university) and a good girlfriend. Before this all happened we couldn't really see each other very much but we still texted and tried out best.

I've always been there for her and optimistic that we would find the time when we could to make the most of it. I drove her home from a weekend staying in our hometown and we try to figure things out but it ends up we break up and I'm heartbroken

I still drive her home and do my best but she sends me a long message saying that she can't bare to see pictures of me with friends or in a relationship so she deletes me. I'm confused about the whole situation but somehow talk myself into that it's for the best. 

The next day when I come home from school I see a bag on the doorstep. When I look inside its all the things I gave her through the time together. I was crushed. I felt betrayed, lonely, and couldn't understand what I did to deserve this. I quickly glance at her roommate's Facebook and see that they went out downtown and I think the worse. Of all the years I've known her, I've never seen her act like this.

Now that it has been some time I am doing better. I try not to look too much into what she is doing but I feel wrong and I have urges to at least Facebook her or say hey at school. I was wondering if anyone else could relate or provide some guidance.

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years and she dumped me saying she couldn't be a good student and girlfriend. I still drive her home and she deletes me. I find a bag of all the things I gave her and feel betrayed. I'm doing better but I have urges to reach out to her again. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, it's normal to have urges to reach out to her again, especially after 2.5 years. But take a step back and think about why you're feeling this way. Is it because you still have feelings for her or is it because you're trying to prove to yourself that you're still important to her? Either way, it's not healthy for you to be reaching out to her right now. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing."
* "I went through something similar and it took me a while to realize that I was holding onto the relationship because I was scared of being alone. I think you're doing the right thing by taking time for yourself and focusing on your own healing. Don't reach out to her, just focus on becoming the best version of yourself. You'll be surprised at how much stronger and more confident you'll feel."
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and your relationship. It's normal to have regrets and what-ifs, but don't let those feelings consume you. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and that might not be with your ex. Keep doing what you're doing and focus on yourself. You got this!"
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you were really invested in the relationship and it's hard to let go. But you need to remember that you can't control how others feel or behave. You did your part by being a good partner, and now it's time to focus on yourself. Don't reach out to her, just focus on becoming the best version of yourself. You'll be surprised at how much stronger and more confident you'll feel."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on the relationship and what you learned from it. What were some of the things that you loved about her, and what were some of the things that you didn't love? What did you learn about yourself and what did you learn about relationships? Take some time to journal or talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings. This will help you process your emotions and move forward in a positive way."  SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TITLE: Me [22F] and my boyfriend [21 M] dated for a year, he ended it two months ago and he's just now figured out that I'm "it"

POST: I'm a senior in college right now and my boyfriend and I had been dating for about a year when he ended it very abruptly about 2 months ago. With that it ended pretty explosively. The initial breakup was - as normal - upsetting but fine. Within days though he was pestering me via text and through mutual friends, constantly trying to get me to talk to him. Basically, when I went back to his place to get my stuff back, it ended in an extremely heated argument with lots of yelling on his end.

Fastforward 2 months and we've just gotten back from our separate spring breaks. I come home to a text from him saying that breaking up with me was the biggest mistake of his life and that he would like an opportunity to talk and a chance to prove his worth to me. We ended up talking for a long time during which we talked about what had happened during our relationship and he explained to me that he broke up with me because he was intimidated by the fact that I had a job so long before him and that there were some pretty bad problems going on at home that he felt he couldn't talk to me about.

We've been texting a little over the past few days since I said we could try being friends. Tonight though, I received a long text from him saying basically he would like to date me again because he has realized that I am "the one" and he wants a second chance.

So confused here, I have no idea what to do and I am feeling incredibly torn. Any advice would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 months ago, now he's saying he realizes I'm "the one" and wants a second chance. I'm torn and unsure what to do.

---

This post is a great example of a common phenomenon in relationships: the "I was wrong, let me try again" scenario. The OP is understandably confused and torn about what to do, and the post is a great opportunity for the community to offer advice and support.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "Take your time and think about what you really want. Are you willing to give him another chance, or do you feel like you've moved on?"
* "Remember that he broke up with you once before, and he didn't seem to have any issues with your job or his home life at the time. What's changed now?"
* "It's great that he's realized his mistakes and wants to make amends, but are you willing to forgive and forget? Or do you need more time to heal and move on?"
* "Consider what you're looking for in a relationship and whether this second chance aligns with those goals. Are you looking for someone who is willing to work through issues and communicate openly, or are you looking for someone who is willing to take responsibility for their actions?"

Overall, this post is a great example of the kinds of complex and nuanced relationship issues that people face, and the community's responses can offer valuable insights and advice for navigating these situations.

TITLE: Me [M17] and my girlfriend [F16] for 11 months fight and bicker over everything, how do we stop?

POST: Me and her fight over every single little thing you can think of, but they aren't huge arguments where we yell and scream at each other, but more of petty disagreements, that happen every day or every other day.

They have been going on for quite a while, but haven't always happened when we first started dating we got along great! We were always happy and never disagreed but past that, after about month 3 we started bickering about everything, however it is never in person only on the phone.

I am asking for advice on what to do, how to stop bickering, really at this point any advice is appreciated, we both agreed we can't continue doing this.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 11 months fight and bicker over everything, but only on the phone, how do we stop?

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm glad you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. Here's a suggestion: try to identify the underlying issues that are causing these petty disagreements. Are you guys stressed about something specific? Are there any unresolved issues from the past that are still bothering you? Once you figure out what's causing the tension, you can start working on addressing those issues and finding ways to communicate more effectively.

COMMENT 2:
I think it's great that you're acknowledging that this isn't healthy and you're willing to work on it. One thing that might help is to establish some ground rules for your phone conversations. For example, you could agree to not bring up certain topics or to not argue about things that aren't that important. You could also try to focus on the present moment and not dwell on past grievances. And finally, you could try to practice active listening and really hear each other out instead of just waiting for your turn to speak.

COMMENT 3:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to find common ground and things that you both enjoy. When you're arguing, it's easy to get caught up in your own perspective and forget that you're both on the same team. By focusing on the things that you both enjoy, you can start to build a sense of connection and understanding that can help to diffuse tension.

COMMENT 4:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to practice empathy and understanding. When you're arguing, it's easy to get caught up in your own feelings and forget that the other person has their own perspective and feelings too. By trying to put yourself in their shoes and understand where they're coming from, you can start to build a sense of connection and understanding that can help to diffuse tension.

COMMENT 5:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to find ways to relax and reduce stress. When you're feeling stressed and anxious, it's easy to get caught up in your own emotions and forget that the other person is there to support you. By finding ways to relax and reduce stress, you can start to build a sense of connection and understanding that can help to diffuse tension.

COMMENT 6:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to practice gratitude and appreciation. When you're arguing, it's easy to get caught up in your own negative emotions and forget about the things that you're grateful for. By focusing on the things that you're grateful for, you can start to build a sense of connection and understanding that can help to diffuse tension.

COMMENT 7:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to find ways to have fun and enjoy each other's company. When you're arguing, it's easy to get caught up in your own emotions and forget about the things that you enjoy together. By finding ways to have fun and enjoy each other's company, you can start to build a sense of connection and understanding that can help to diffuse tension.

COMMENT 8:
I think it's great that you're recognizing that this isn't healthy and you're looking for a way to improve things. One thing that might help is to try to practice forgiveness and letting go.

TITLE: Is it really possible to meet the right person at the wrong time?

POST: This past October I (19F) met a really great guy (20M) through tinder. We went on a few dates here and there and got along really well.

However, we did run into some problems when it came to hanging out. If I had some free time, he would be working or in school (does both full time). And if he had free time I'd be in school or not home at the time (plus, I don't have my license yet so transportation was a factor too). This made it really difficult for us to hang out and see each other more. 

Today, we started talking on snapchat and he told me he doesn't think this can work anymore. I was crushed because I was really starting to like him and he even told me he had feelings for me as well. He said he just wants to work on himself for a while. I asked him if it's possible if things do work out in the future will he reconsider trying again. He didn't give me a straight answer saying it just depends on when it happens. 

So my question for you /r/relationships is it possible to meet the right person at the wrong time? And if yes, can things work out in the end? I'm really hurt right now and don't know how to feel because this has never happened to me before.

TL;DR: Met a great guy on tinder, but due to conflicting schedules and circumstances, we couldn't make it work. He's decided to focus on himself for now, and I'm left wondering if it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time.

RESPONSES:

* "It's definitely possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. Sometimes people need to focus on themselves before they can be ready for a relationship. It's not uncommon for people to grow and change before they're ready for a serious relationship. It's not a reflection on you or him, it's just a timing thing. You can always keep in touch and see how things go in the future."
* "I think it's great that he's recognizing his own needs and taking the time to focus on himself. That takes a lot of self-awareness and maturity. It's not about you, it's about him being honest with himself about what he needs right now. You can't force someone to be ready for a relationship, and it's not fair to expect someone to put their own needs on hold for you. You deserve someone who is ready and willing to prioritize you."
* "I think it's okay to be hurt, but try not to take it personally. It's not about you, it's about his own personal growth and development. You can always keep in touch and see how things go in the future. Maybe he'll come back around when he's ready, or maybe you'll meet someone else who's a better match for you. Either way, you'll come out stronger and wiser from this experience."
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on this experience and wondering if it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. It's a valid question, and the answer is yes, it is possible. Sometimes people need to grow and change before they're ready for a relationship, and that's okay. You can always keep in touch and see how things go in the future. Maybe he'll come back around when he's ready, or maybe you'll meet someone else who's a better match for you. Either way, you'll come out stronger and wiser from this experience."
* "I think it's important to remember that timing is everything in relationships. Sometimes people need to be in the right place at the right time to make it work. It's not always about the person themselves, it's about the circumstances. You can always keep in touch and see how things go in the future. Maybe he'll come back around when he's ready, or maybe you'll meet someone else who's a better match for you. Either way, you'll come out stronger and wiser from this experience."

TITLE: I'm pretty sure my boyfriend's (M22) girl friend (F21) has a crush on him. How do I handle it?

POST: Yesterday, my boyfriend had a pool party and invited a bunch of people.  I think one of the girls he's friends with has a crush on him.  As soon as I met her, I just knew.  I catch her staring at my boyfriend, teasing him in a flirty manner, and she laughs at *everything* he says.

At the pool party, she took it upon herself to let my boyfriend know that he was getting a little sunburned on his back.  Not even five minutes later, she was putting sunscreen on his back and rubbing/massaging his shoulders. 

She followed him around the entire time.  This girl has got it bad for my boyfriend.

Is there a good way to bring this up with him in a loving way?  We're in a five month relationship so it's not like we've been together that long.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's friend (F21) has a crush on him and I think she's trying to get his attention. How do I bring it up with him in a loving way?

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it's probably best to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Try to approach the conversation without being accusatory or assuming, and focus on how you're feeling instead of what you think she's doing. You could say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about [girl's name]. I've noticed that she's been flirting with you a lot lately and I'm feeling a little insecure about it. Can we talk about how you feel about her and how you're going to handle the situation?'"
* "I would suggest having a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns, but also try to keep in mind that it's possible that [girl's name] doesn't have romantic feelings for him and is just being friendly. It's also possible that your boyfriend doesn't even notice her flirting and is just being friendly back. Try not to jump to conclusions or assume the worst."
* "I think it's great that you're being proactive and wanting to address this issue. However, I would caution against being too confrontational or accusatory. Instead, try to have a calm and rational conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. You could say something like 'Hey, I've noticed that [girl's name] has been flirting with you a lot lately and I'm feeling a little insecure about it. Can we talk about how you feel about her and how you're going to handle the situation?'"
* "I think it's important to remember that you can't control how other people feel or behave, but you can control how you react to the situation. Instead of trying to 'handle' the situation, try to focus on building a stronger connection with your boyfriend and communicating openly and honestly with him about your feelings and concerns."

TITLE: Made a mistake and need advice

POST: I have been seeing a friend and classmate for a while now (6 months) and I have taken her to numerous dinners. We always enjoy each others company and share the same interests. After our last dinner I told her that I havent been on a date in a real long time and was thinking about getting into the scene agian. She was obviously distressed because I am assuming she thought we were on dates this whole time. Anyways to make a long story short I ended up kissing her when leaving. It was real sudden and took her completely off gaurd. When I got home we talked on the phone and I admitted that I was unaware that the dinners we were on were dates. However I do like her and would like to continue seeing her and to make sure my actions were not crossing any lines. She said I didnt cross any lines. So, I asked her on another real date this tuesday and she agreed. This all happened on Thursday of last week. I texted her twice yesterday(Saturday) to which she didn't responed and recently tried to call her to make plans (amusement park) and she didn;t pick up nor return my call. I am wondering should I stop communication and let her figure out what she wants or send a text telling her I am sorry for how I did it, becuase I am not sorry I did kiss her. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Made a mistake by kissing a friend/classmate after telling her I was getting back into dating. She said I didn't cross any lines, but hasn't responded to my texts/calls since. Should I stop communication or apologize?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you need to stop and think about how she's feeling. You basically blindsided her with a kiss, and now she's probably feeling confused and unsure about your intentions. Give her some space and let her process her emotions. Don't apologize for the kiss itself, but apologize for not being clear about your intentions beforehand. And honestly, maybe take a step back and re-evaluate whether you're ready to start dating again. You're not doing yourself or her any favors by rushing into things."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Oh boy, this is a mess. You're basically saying you took advantage of her feelings and didn't even have the decency to be honest with her about your intentions. And now you're wondering if you should apologize? Yeah, you should apologize. A lot. And then you should take some time to reflect on why you felt the need to kiss her without her consent. And maybe, just maybe, you should take a hard look at your own feelings and motivations before trying to pursue a relationship with her again."
3. **u/relationship_guru**: "I think you're getting ahead of yourself here. You've already apologized for not being clear about your intentions, which is a good start. Now, it's time to focus on rebuilding trust and communication with her. Stop trying to plan dates and just have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Ask her what she needs from you to feel comfortable and respected in this situation. And for goodness' sake, don't pressure her into anything she's not ready for. Let her come to you and take things at her own pace."
4. **u/awkward_situation**: "I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's the truth: you need to respect her boundaries. If she's not responding to your texts or calls, that's a pretty clear sign that she needs some space. Don't take it personally and don't try to force the issue. Just give her the space she needs and let her come to you when she's ready to talk. And honestly, if she's not willing to communicate with you after this, maybe it's best to just move on and focus on building a connection with someone who is willing to work through the tough stuff with you."

TITLE: Me [34M] with my separated wife [33F] 14 years, why do i feel nothing?

POST: Quick run down of the relationship:

Whirlwind romance and 6 months later Married young (20 and 19 respectively), together for 14 years, 2 kids over the course of it. In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.

For a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to "evaluate her feelings", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of "us", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.

After a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical/mental affection (often not both at the same time).

Is this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?
Should i be open about my feelings and experiences (we made a clause on breakup, she didnt want to know anything i did with other people while we were separated, and told me to lie if i had done anything) or would that just end everything, and if it did is that for the best?

If someone could just live my life for me for a bit and give it back in a few months that would be grand :D

TL;DR: 14 year marriage ends, i begged to get back together, she asked me to cut contact, i've moved on, she's now saying she still has feelings, but i feel nothing. Is this normal? Should i be open about my experiences or keep them hidden? Should i just move on or try to rekindle things?

This post is a great example of a complex and nuanced relationship situation. The OP (original poster) has been in a 14-year marriage, had two kids, and has been separated from his wife for a while. He's been trying to get back together, but she's been hesitant and has asked him to cut contact. Meanwhile, he's been moving on and has had a sexual experience with someone else.

The OP is now feeling a mix of emotions, including pity for his wife's current situation and exasperation at the on-again-off-again contact and physical/mental affection he's been experiencing with her. He's wondering if this is normal, if he's going through a phase, and if he should be open about his feelings and experiences.

The post raises many questions, including:

* Is it normal to feel nothing after a long-term relationship ends?
* Should the OP be open about his feelings and experiences, or keep them hidden?
* Should he try to rekindle things with his wife, or move on with his life?

The post also highlights the complexity of relationships and the emotions that come with them. It's a great example of how relationships can be messy and unpredictable, and how people can experience a range of emotions, including feelings of guilt, shame, and uncertainty. Overall, the post is a great example of the kinds of complex and nuanced relationship situations that people may face in their lives.

TITLE: I'm a [23 M] and coincidentally met a great [21 F] girl over the weekend. The problem? She lives far away. Help me out Reddit!

POST: Over this weekend I was able to meet a remarkable girl. Pretty much from the get go it was obvious that at least I was interested (I drunkenly gave her a flower at a cocktail party to start off our first conversation), but she also ended up hanging out with me the next night as well at my house, albeit with her friend. She knows I have a crush on her. I know she is interested in me at the least as a friend, but I am not fully confident if she is interested as anything more (we've only met a couple days, I'm about 60-70% sure she's interested in me beyond friendship - I thought I heard her asking her friend if it was okay to sleep over at my place but I'm not sure).

I don't have a problem with LDRs provided they are serious but to be honest, I have my own life and school to focus on now anyway. I don't think I want a relationship as of the current moment. I'm more interested in down the road - this is the first girl that I met that is astoundingly pretty, captivating, and is part of my exact same culture (families are pretty much the exact same which I value a lot). Practically speaking, it's perfect material for a serious relationship save for the fact that she lives far away. Which pretty much renders the whole thing impractical as of the moment.

I want to continue talking to her but I'm not sure where or how to gear the relationship. I'd like to get to know her better but also be in a place in the future where she knows I'm (likely) seriously interested and I can figure out if she is seriously interested in a relationship. 

I know I've only met her a couple days, but I've just got a feeling on this one...

TL;DR: Met a great girl over the weekend, but she lives far away. I'm not sure where to take the relationship or how to gauge her interest. Help me out Reddit!

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're 23 and she's 21. You're not even out of college yet. Take your time, focus on your studies, and don't rush into anything. You don't know what the future holds, and you don't want to compromise your education for a long-distance relationship that might not even work out."
* **u/sarcastic_sally**: "Oh, great, another guy who thinks he's got it all figured out because he met a girl who's 'astoundingly pretty' and 'captivating'. Newsflash: it's not about looks or charm, it's about compatibility and shared values. Don't get ahead of yourself, dude. You don't even know if she's interested in you beyond friendship."
* **u/long_distance_lover**: "I've been in LDRs for years, and I can tell you that it's not impossible. But you need to be realistic about the challenges you'll face. Make sure you're both on the same page about what you want from the relationship, and be prepared to put in the effort to make it work. It's not easy, but it can be worth it if you're willing to put in the work."
* **u/relationship_advisor**: "I think you're being a bit too cautious, OP. You've got a connection with this girl, and it's worth exploring. Just be honest with her about your feelings and your concerns, and see where it takes you. Don't be afraid to take things slow and get to know her better. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll have learned something valuable about yourself and what you want in a relationship."

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell while driving

POST: I'll start from this morning. It was a normal day for me. I woke up at around 7:30 as I usually do so I could wake up and get to work on time. I did so, worked my 8 hours, clocked in, clocked out. My coworkers wanted to go out to get something to eat, but I wasn't feeling social today, so I passed and walked to my car.

However, I was feeling rather hungry. I'm currently on a diet, but I've been on it for a rather long time (around 6 months) so I had forgotten what the taste of a deliciously disgusting Taco Bell taco tasted like. Once I started thinking about it, I couldn't stop so I set my course to the nearest Taco Bell about 15 minutes away.

After driving for a bit I finally reached my destination. I pulled up to the drive-thru, placed my order for 2 tacos, a crunchwrap and a large Mountain Dew. I pulled up to the next window, paid for my order, and sat the bag of food on the passenger seat next to me. I checked my phone to see what time it was, and determined that I had enough time to eat in a parking space and be home in time for my family. 

Let's just say I fucking ravaged those first 2 tacos. I scarfed them down like I've never seen what a scrap of food looked like before. As I'm about to move onto my crunchwrap, I get a phonecall from my wife asking where I am.

"You're at Taco Bell?! You said you'd drive Caitlyn (our daughter) to soccer practice!"

Shit. I hung up the phone and stepped on the gas with one hand on the wheel and another on my crunchwrap. I was doing 70 on the highway trying to rush back to get my daughter there on time. 

But that crunchwrap was way to delicious. I was paying too much attention to the deliciousness, the amazingness, the...

I felt a thud. My windshield cracked. I pulled over and stepped out of my car to what was the remains of a now dead deer and a busted windshield along with other damages to my car. Caitlyn was late to practice.

TL;DR: I ate Taco Bell while driving, got a call from my wife, and ended up crashing into a deer, damaging my car, and making my daughter late to soccer practice.

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a hilarious and embarrassing tale of how they messed up their day. In this case, the author's love for Taco Bell led them to eat while driving, which ultimately resulted in a car accident and a bunch of other problems. The post is relatable, entertaining, and has a good dose of humor, making it a great example of a TIFU story.

TITLE: Me [18F] with the guy [24~M] I've been seeing for a month, not sure if i should mention him to my judgmental family at Easter.

POST: I'm very happy with this guy so far, we've been getting along great. We've got good communication and we're on the same page about where we are and where we see things going. 

This weekend he's meeting my family, but just my parents and siblings. He's also invited me over to meet his family for a while on Easter, which i'm very excited about. 

However, I'm also going to be spending part of Easter with my extended family. Many of these relatives tend to be somewhat judgmental and disapproving of my relationships. Not the *people* I date, but how many people I've dated, and that I put these relationships on facebook (because "people can see how many people you date, and might think you're promiscuous"). I've had my fair share of relationships, but never more than 2 in one year. 

I originally wanted to hold off on talking about him until things got more serious, hoping that my family would take me more seriously. However, I also don't want to appear ashamed of him, or like I'm trying to hide him. I appriciate that he has been so open about me meeting his family, and want to be able to share my family with him too.

TL;DR: Should I mention my boyfriend to my judgmental family at Easter, or wait until things get more serious?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not about how many people you've dated, it's about the quality of the relationships. If you're happy with this guy, then don't worry about what your family thinks. You do you!"
* "I think it's great that you're considering your family's opinions. Maybe you could have a conversation with them beforehand and explain how you feel about your relationships and why you're happy with this guy. It might help them understand you better."
* "I would definitely mention him to your family. It's not fair to make him meet your family without being open about your relationship. Plus, it's a great opportunity to show your family that you're serious about him and that you're happy."
* "I would wait until things get more serious. You don't want to rush into anything or seem like you're trying to prove something to your family. Just enjoy the relationship and see where it goes."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your family's opinions, but ultimately, you should do what makes you happy. If you're happy with this guy, then don't worry about what your family thinks. You do you!"

**Conclusion:**

The OP is considering whether to mention their boyfriend to their judgmental family at Easter. The comments are divided, with some people advising the OP to be open and honest about their relationship, while others suggest waiting until things get more serious. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and what they feel comfortable with. It's important to remember that it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, and not to let others dictate your relationships.

TITLE: A little help please?

POST: So, I've been in a relationship with my (now ex) girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years and it just ended suddenly tonight. I guess it was because of a lot of stuff that's been building up throughout our relationship. It is long distance because I'm away at college so I definitely understand why things went sour. For clarification, I broke up with her. She was fairly controlling throughout our relationship and was also extremely clingy. I never really got any appreciation for the stuff I did for her and she is also an extremely jealous person. I'm the only person that she has to rely on when she needs someone and she expects me to be at her side at the drop of a hat. We had different views on a lot of things, including religion, marriage, and children, but we were extremely serious and considering engagement in the future. Fiscally, she wasn't really appropriate for me because she is a rather large spender while I prefer to save our money. Unfortunately, I would give in on these whims and now I don't really have much to show for working throughout my high school career. Although things haven't been that good for us when we are away from one another, they are typically really good when we are together. After breaking up with her, she told me that she was going to change everything that I dislike about her because she had figured all of this out already and was wanting to fix it before anything bad happened. I told her that it was a little too late because these problems have come up before and they were never fixed, but she insisted that she would keep trying she also said that she hopes that we can get back together some time in the future. I really don't know how to handle the situation, Reddit. Can you help me out? Do I stay friends with her? Do I give her another chance? Do I try to experience more of the college lifestyle and meet other girls and date them? Any advice you can offer is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years due to her controlling, clingy, and jealous behavior. She's saying she wants to change and we can get back together in the future. I'm unsure what to do. Should I stay friends, give her another chance, or move on and meet new people?

TITLE: Just finished A Thousand Splendid Suns. The end kicked my ass. Reddit, what  moments in literature/film have overwhelmed you?

POST: SPOILER ALERT: I loved A Thousand Splendid Suns. Read it in 3 days. It was a page turner, for sure. At the end, when she puts the tape in, and it's Pinocchio, and she has no idea why... I threw the book across the room and bawled like I haven't since my best friend died. I don't know why.. Everything came rushing back. I thought about where I'd been, where I'm going.. I thought about all the amazing people in the world who will be forgotten. I thought about how cruel I've been, and how selfish. I thought about how people in the world are suffering while I am sitting in America. I thought about too many things at once, and it took me a good 15 minutes to come down from that emotional high. Truly one of the greatest moments of my literary history.

So reddit... I'd like to know, what moments in literature, film, comics, tv, etc.. have had an emotional impact on you? Preferably something that you weren't expecting. Something simple, something complex, something obscure, something famous. I want to know, what are the most gut wrenching, heart warming, enlightening, wonderful, awful twists (yes, I said it) that human minds have ever conceived of. What's made your hair stand on end, your heart drop into your stomach, your eyes swell up, a lump form in your throat, choked you up, made you shout "NO." The only think I ask of you is to put the title at the top so that if we haven't seen/read it, we know not to look at the comment.

TL;DR: Just finished A Thousand Splendid Suns and it kicked my emotional butt. I want to know what moments in literature, film, etc. have had an emotional impact on you. Share your stories!

COMMENTS:

* **u/throwaway123456**: The ending of The Fault in Our Stars. I was expecting a happy ending, but the twist hit me like a ton of bricks. I was sobbing uncontrollably for hours.
* **u/bookworm3000**: The ending of The Road. I won't spoil it, but it's a gut-wrenching moment that made me question the meaning of humanity.
* **u/moviesrock**: The final scene of The Shawshank Redemption. I was expecting a happy ending, but the music and the imagery just crushed me. I was in tears for days.
* **u/comicbooknerd**: The death of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man. I was a kid when I read it, but it still haunts me to this day.
* **u/TVaddict**: The finale of Breaking Bad. I didn't expect the ending to be so emotional, but it was like a punch to the gut. I was crying for hours.
* **u/reader123**: The ending of The Book Thief. It's a beautiful story, but the ending is just devastating. I was sobbing uncontrollably for hours.
* **u/musiclover**: The ending of The Notebook. I knew it was coming, but it still got me every time. I was crying for days.
* **u/gamer123**: The ending of The Last of Us. It's a game, but the emotional impact was real. I was sobbing uncontrollably for hours.
* **u/author123**: The ending of The Handmaid's Tale. It's a powerful story, but the ending is just devastating. I was crying for hours.
* **u/filmstudent**: The ending of The 400 Blows. It's a classic film, but the ending is just heartbreaking. I was crying for days.
* **u/reader456**: The ending of The Kite Runner. It's a powerful story, but the ending is just devastating. I was crying for hours.

TITLE: Hi Reddit. I said something inappropriate around my family. Please tell me what YOU said. HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH BEING BANISHED FROM THE FAMILY?

POST: Tonight I was at dinner with my dad and step mom. My dad is way older than my step mom. 
I asked my step mom if she married my dad while she was in college or before she started college.
My brother replied for her and said "while she was in elementary school". As a joke and everyone laughed.
I got excited because I...I'm lame and something inappropriate slipped out...
Along the lines of....my dad having a white van....hiding candy in it.....driving around schools....doing things....it got worse as I kept talking.
I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. It's like I don't have a filter. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
Anyway, everyone just exchanged awkward glances and my brother said "wow, sometimes you shouldn't be invited to dinner." 
And my step mom said I was "disgusting". 
I decided to just  be quiet the whole night and eat lots of cheesecake. I don't know if I could have said something to fix the situation.

TL;DR: I said something inappropriate at dinner and my family is mad at me. What did YOU do when you messed up and got in trouble with your family?

TITLE: Do I move back in with my boyfriend?

POST: I'm a 22/F with a 23/M and we've been together for 2.5 years. Our relationship is loving and happy, and due to the fact that we live approximately 45 minutes away from each other (both living with our parents [embarrassing, but resources we're lucky to have]) have to restrict our visits to about 2 days a week. 

We did the 2 days a week for a year and a half, then we got an apartment together for 6 months. When we lived together life was wonderful, and I couldn't ask for better. Due to various financial difficulties compounded by extreme family crises, we both moved back to our parents' homes until the crises were dealt with and we had enough saved up to move out again. The time to move out of my parents' house is coming up,  I'm unsure if when I move back out it should be with him.

It has always been extremely important to me that I live by myself for at least a year, at some (relatively early) point in my adult life. My mom drilled in to me that you must learn to be alone in order to function well within relationships, and I think at this point I would feel like I had missed out on something major if I didn't experience living on my own soon. 

I've talked about this with my boyfriend and he understands/encourages me to do what I need to do, but I don't want to move without him. So much of my relationship with him has been spent with strict limits on time that when the opportunity arises to live with him again I know I won't want to say "No". Plus, it just seems like a huge economic waste for us both to be paying for an apartment, Internet, etc. etc., when we could just be splitting the bill (our low incomes plays a role in my trepidation as well), when he moves to the same city I'm moving to.

TL;DR: Should I move back in with my boyfriend or take the opportunity to live on my own for a bit?

---

This post is a great example of a relationship dilemma that many people can relate to. The OP is torn between her desire to live on her own and her desire to be with her boyfriend. She's already experienced living together with him once before, and it was great, but she's also been living with her parents for a while now and wants to gain some independence.

The OP is seeking advice from the Reddit community on whether she should move back in with her boyfriend or take the opportunity to live on her own for a bit. She's aware that her boyfriend understands and encourages her to do what she needs to do, but she's still unsure about what to do.

The comments on this post are varied, with some people advising the OP to take the opportunity to live on her own and gain some independence, while others are encouraging her to move back in with her boyfriend and continue their relationship. Some people are also suggesting that the OP and her boyfriend could find a compromise, such as living together but with some boundaries or rules in place to help them maintain their independence.

Overall, this post is a great example of a relationship dilemma that many people can relate to, and the comments on the post are a great example of how people can offer advice and support to help each other navigate these kinds of situations.

TITLE: Ex (30/f) of 2 years and I (27/m) broke up a few months ago. I really do love her but she won't tell me she does.

POST: I know I'm going to get some crappy replies to this but I'm sucking up and I'm going to take it on the chin. 

For the past year, I used my ex as an emotional punchbag. I have been going through issues which have left myself emotionally unable to stop myself from saying things and blowing up out of proportion. I was recently diagnosed with bpd which I was worried about and basically, I used her as that emotional punchbag for a year before we split. 

I have since come to terms with the fact that I completely cocked up, pushed her away and used her for my problems. I have really felt bad about it and I have told her I love her. She doesn't say anything back but I know that when she hears it, she changes her attitude for the better. 

I really want to get back with her and put this behind us. I know there's something still there even if the chances are small. I would jump at the opportunity no matter how small to show that I have come to terms with who I am and what is wrong with me. I know if we can get over this, we'll be stronger than ever and ready to take on the world. She really is the love of my life. I know everyone says it but it's true. I've never loved someone as much as I 

Any advice on what to do would be much appreciated and how to approach, what seems to be, this thorny subject.

TITLE: My girlfriend (25/f) has been distant and cold towards me for the past few weeks. I've tried talking to her about it but she just says everything is fine.

POST: Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm at my wit's end and I don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and everything was great until a few weeks ago. She's been distant and cold towards me, barely responding to my texts or messages, and when we do talk, she seems really unhappy and uninterested. 

I've tried talking to her about it, but she just says everything is fine and that I'm being paranoid. I've also tried giving her space, but it seems like the more space I give her, the more distant she becomes. 

I love her and I want to make things right, but I don't know how to get through to her. I've been feeling really anxious and depressed because of this, and I just want to know if there's anything I can do to fix things. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: Me [18 F] with my Boyfriend [26 M] 8 months, my sex drive is bigger than his

POST: I've been dating Boyfriend for about 8 months, and this isn't a huge problem or a deal breaker. I love him a lot and we have plans on marrying when I'm done with university. Unfortunately, this has been a problem for a long while now, and it's really been getting troublesome these past couple days.

See, the more time goes on, the more sex I want to have with him. I see sex as one of the few ways that I feel close to him. For him, though, sex is just an extra thing to do with the person he loves. Which is fine, except that there are days when he's just too tired to do things. And while I respect that, those also happen to be the days where I see him the least, which makes me want to feel close to him even more. It hurts to be turned down, and it hurts him to hurt me, and it hurts me to hurt him, so on and so forth. While its only been this difficult these past couple of days, we both agree that this is kind of a problem that should be resolved sooner rather than be held off.

My position is to change, and that it's my own problem that I have to deal with. He doesn't think I should, though, and that there's some middle ground that we can reach that works. I'm really not sure what to do. Masturbation doesn't really work, and forcing him to put out is not an option.

TL;DR: I have a bigger sex drive than my boyfriend, and it's causing tension in our relationship. I want to find a solution, but I'm not sure what to do.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships, where one partner has a higher sex drive than the other. The OP (original poster) is struggling to find a solution to this problem, as they feel that their boyfriend is not meeting their sexual needs. The post is seeking advice and support from the community.

The OP's concerns are valid, as a mismatched sex drive can cause tension and frustration in a relationship. The post highlights the importance of communication and finding a compromise that works for both partners.

Some possible solutions that the OP could consider include:

* Communicating openly with their boyfriend about their needs and desires
* Exploring different sexual activities or positions that may be more appealing to their boyfriend
* Setting boundaries and prioritizing intimacy in other ways, such as through cuddling or kissing
* Seeking professional help from a couples therapist or sex therapist

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance for individuals navigating common relationship challenges.

TITLE: My bf [23] doesn't speak of his childhood, but I[f22] know he's traumatized.

POST: We were friends for 10 years, before we got together. He than told me once about his terrible childhood. (He told only 3 of his friends his story)

Now we're a couple for quite a few months and well, sometimes there's stuff I know that reminds him of his childhood, but it's like he's forgotten that he had told me. So he keeps pretending that nothing happened.

Some examples
Lately we were watching an old TVshow, that every child watched when we're young, like Sesamestreet, and he couldn't remember a thing. (Which I think is because he forced himself to forget everything.)
He likes christmas, but only the food, not the stuff with Santa, and he hates to get presents. (Which is the thing childs like the most about christmas.)
And stuff like watching TVshows about raising children. We talk about how we're going to raise ours in the future and that we won't will be as horrible as the parents on TV. (But striking, the things he thinks are important are always the things his parents should have done, to save him from the traumatizing stuff.)

I know he likes to put his problems far away. But on the other hand, I'm his girlfriend now and we're pretty serious, isn't it good to speak about it maybe just once, so he knows I know his secret/won't tell, and most of all, I'm always there for him?

What do you think?

TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn't talk about his childhood, but I know he's traumatized. He's been friends with me for 10 years, and I know his story. Now we're a couple, but he pretends like nothing happened. I want to help him, but I don't know how.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It's great that you care about your boyfriend's well-being, but it's not your responsibility to 'fix' him. He may not be ready to talk about his childhood, and that's okay. Respect his boundaries and let him know that you're there for him when he is ready to open up. You can also encourage him to seek professional help, but ultimately, it's up to him to decide what he's comfortable with."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "It's understandable that you want to help your boyfriend, but you need to consider his feelings and boundaries. It's possible that he's not ready to talk about his childhood, and pushing him to do so could make him feel uncomfortable or even worse, like you're trying to 'fix' him. Instead, focus on building a strong and supportive relationship with him, and let him know that you're there for him when he's ready to talk about his feelings."
3. **u/traumatized**: "I'm a survivor of childhood trauma, and I can tell you that it's not easy to talk about. It's a very personal and painful topic, and it's not something that can be 'fixed' overnight. Your boyfriend may not be ready to talk about his childhood, and that's okay. Let him know that you're there for him, and that you'll support him when he's ready to open up. Don't push him to talk about it, and don't try to 'fix' him. Just be there for him, and let him know that you care."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you're concerned about your boyfriend's well-being, but you need to consider his feelings and boundaries. It's possible that he's not ready to talk about his childhood, and pushing him to do so could make him feel uncomfortable or even worse, like you're trying to 'fix' him.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21] of 2 years wants to get blackout drunk at parties, I [M 23] am not comfortable with this.

POST: Hey everyone, my girlfriend doesn't go out a lot but when she does start drinking she has a hard time stopping and goes too far and gets black out drunk. She has promised me on multiple occasions that she wasn't going to over do it with the drinking but still drank way too much. As her boyfriend, I feel uncomfortable when she is that intoxicated around other guys because she is vulnerable and her friends have proven in the past that they don't look out for her if she gets into a bad situation. 

Am I being a crazy, over protective boyfriend for not wanting her to get so drunk at parties, concerts, etc.? What could be a solution that is fair to her?

TITLE: I (20 F) had a MissCarriage with my (25 M) BF a year ago, I feel EMPTY and, I want to try to have a baby. he doesn't. Advice?

POST: When i was 16 i had an abortion with my ex boyfriend. 
living with guilt, 
two years later my boyfriend (23 M) and i (18 F) (being together for a year or so) at the time ended up being pregnant.
At first he wanted to have an abortion. 
I could not live with myself if i would have agreed to do so.
2 months pass by and we have never been so in love. it was the holiday season and on christmas eve i began to bleed. i went to the ER and the doctors told me everything was fine and sent me home. (i saw a sonogram that day) Also that day he was not present due to being at work,
the day after christmas, i misscarried.
i have never felt so empty in my life.
i am sad whenever i see a baby, or an infant 
I want to have a child, but whenever i tell him he just says "not right now" or "maybe when i'm 30"
we have been together for about 2.5 years now. But this may be a deal breaker for me because of how i feel and how much i love him and want him to have my children.

TL;DR: I had a miscarriage a year ago and I feel empty and want to have a baby. My boyfriend doesn't want to have kids right now and I'm not sure if I can continue the relationship if he doesn't change his mind.

TITLE: Me (28F) with my (32F) sister. She has been struggling to get pregnant for well over a year. My husband and I started trying and I'm pregnant within the month. How can I approach this with sensitivity without overthinking everything?

POST: Hi reddit! I've created this new account for anonymity. 

My sister and I have a good relationship despite living half way around the world from one another. I recently found out I was pregnant and figured I shouldn't overthink it and just tell her as I would have told her in the past (before knowing about her visits with fertility doctors etc). She responded very sweetly and is texting me asking several excited questions and there doesn't seem to be any weirdness at all. She seems genuinely thrilled that I'm going to be a mum!

However, I'm still a little worried and overthinking things in my head. I am worried that deep down she is sad and how I should best respect her feelings without making it an issue. The fertility issues she is having would have stayed between her and her husband had it not been for an awkward visit with my mother. My mum visited her (my parents also live in a different country.) and she had to tell my mum because there were so many secret appointments etc. My mum is not the most tactful person and rather than understand it was a private issue just got incredibly excited they were trying, to the point that when she left their house she left a note and candles in their bedroom wishing them luck. Cringe. So my sister and I have been bonding over how cheesy our mum is being.

I'm looking for advice on how to go forward. Should I just pretend that everything is normal and follow her cues? Should I be more sensitive about the subject because of what she is going through?

I can't help but feel guilty. I wasn't going to share with her how long we were trying but when she asked I couldn't lie to her. I feel awful that I got to tell the family happy news before she could. I feel guilty as a little sister to be pregnant before my big sister who deserves it so much. I started trying because it's the right time in my life but I was prepared for it to take much longer! I can't help but wish I had waited a little longer until she could have her moment.

TL;DR: My sister and I are close, she's been struggling to get pregnant for over a year, and I just found out I'm pregnant. I'm worried about how to approach this with sensitivity and not make it an issue. Should I just pretend everything is normal or be more considerate of her feelings?

**Top Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your sister's feelings! It's natural to feel guilty, but try not to beat yourself up over it. You didn't mean to make her feel left out or like she's not getting the attention she deserves. Just be genuine and open with her, and I'm sure she'll appreciate your thoughtfulness."
* "I would suggest being honest with your sister, but also being sensitive to her feelings. You could say something like, 'Hey sis, I know you've been going through a tough time with fertility issues, and I want you to know that I'm here for you. I'm excited to share this news with you, but I also want to make sure you're okay with it.'"
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your sister's feelings, but try not to overthink it too much. Just be yourself and let her know that you're thinking of her. You can always have a conversation with her about it if she brings it up, but don't feel like you need to make a big deal out of it."

**Conclusion:**

The community's response is overwhelmingly supportive and understanding, offering words of encouragement and advice on how to navigate this sensitive situation. By being open and honest with your sister, while also being sensitive to her feelings, you can help to maintain a strong and loving relationship with her. Remember to prioritize your own feelings and well-being as well, and don't be too hard on yourself for getting pregnant before your sister. Congratulations on your pregnancy, and I hope you and your sister can continue to have a strong and loving relationship despite the challenges you're facing.

TITLE: A friend from my old high school asked me to prom, but I really would rather not go.

POST: I'm a freshman in college and a friend of mine texted me last week and asked if I would be her back up date to her senior prom. I explained that I would be getting my wisdom teeth out at the end of May, and I very well may not be able to go so I can't promise anything, so I would have to be her backup.

However, a guy in her grade asked her and she really didn't want to go with him, so she made up this story about how she was trying to work something out with a guy from the next town over, but I was her back up in case it didn't 

She asked me if I would be cool going with her because if she went with someone else from her grade it would look bad. What should I say to her? I actually might be getting my wisdom teeth out during that time so I don't know. I don't want to leave her hanging but I've been to six proms and I think I've had my fill.

TL;DR: Friend from old high school asked me to be her backup date to prom, but I really don't want to go. She's trying to avoid going with someone from her grade and wants me to be her date to avoid looking bad. What should I say to her?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* "Honestly, it's okay to say no. You've been to six proms, and it's not like you're missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Tell her you appreciate the ask, but you're not really interested in going this year. You can even offer to help her find someone else to go with if she's really struggling."
* "I would say something like, 'Hey, I appreciate the ask, but I'm really not feeling up to going to prom this year. I've been to a few already, and I'm good with just staying in and celebrating with friends instead.' You're not obligated to give a reason, but if you do, it's okay to say you're just not interested."
* "If you're really concerned about leaving her hanging, you could say something like, 'I appreciate the ask, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it. I've got some personal stuff going on, and I don't want to commit to something I might not be able to follow through on.' This way, you're not saying no outright, but you're also not promising anything you're not sure you can deliver on."
* "Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and desires. You don't owe it to anyone to go to prom just to avoid looking bad. Be kind, but firm, and tell her you're not interested. You can always offer to help her find someone else to go with if she's really struggling."
* "If you're really worried about hurting her feelings, you could try to find a compromise. For example, you could say, 'I appreciate the ask, but I'm not really feeling up to going to prom this year. However, I'd be happy to help you find someone else to go with, or even just hang out with you and your friends after the prom. Let me know what you think!' This way, you're still being kind and helpful, but you're also being honest about your own feelings and desires."

TITLE: TIFU by water skiing and tubing all weekend

POST: I spent the whole weekend at my buddy's lake house with a few friends, most of which was out on the boat. Now, this was my first time at a lake house and doing all these cool lake house things. I was dying to wakeboard/water ski since I am big into skateboarding and longboarding. I assumed that I'd pick it up pretty quickly considering my experience in other balance related activities. And what do you know, I did pretty well. We took turns on the skis and also battled it out on tubes as well. 
However the fuck up comes in this entire week because I did *not* take into account the muscle strength it takes to hold on for your fucking life when being dragged behind a boat like that. And we were out there all damn day. So I've barely had the muscle strength in my forearms to grip just about anything. Opening the fridge? Nope, grabbing my backpack? Fucking nope. Anything requiring flexing my fingers? Absolutely not. It's been almost a week and it's finally getting to the point where I can function normally again.

TL;DR: Spent the weekend water skiing and tubing, didn't realize how much strength it would take, now I'm struggling to do everyday tasks due to sore forearms.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by assuming water skiing and tubing wouldn't leave you with aching forearms"
* "I did the same thing last summer and it took me a solid week to regain full mobility. You're not alone, bro"
* "I'm surprised you didn't mention the shoulder and back pain too. That's usually the worst part for me"
* "I'm a bit of a wimp, but even I knew to take breaks and stretch when doing water sports. You should've listened to your body, dude"
* "I've been there too, bro. It's like your forearms are screaming at you to stop doing everything. Just remember to stretch and take breaks next time"
* "I'm surprised you didn't mention the sunburn and dehydration too. That's usually the worst part for me"
* "You're not alone, bro. I've done the same thing and it took me a solid week to recover. Just remember to take it easy and stretch next time"

TITLE: friend zone: not sure if the girl i like has attraction to me

POST: His, 

I have known that girl for over 3 years and it's only a year ago that I understood that I am very attracted to her, more than just a friend. In the meantime she has gotten a boyfriend and i really don't know how to act now. 

What worsens things is that I am pretty shy and nerdy, and since more reactive than initiative. She is the type of girl though who expects initiative in a relationship. 

I told her about my feelings and we have never touched this theme since. The furtherst we've gone physically is holding each other's hands and hugging but I am not sure if it's more a courtesy of friendship. She did mention that she is not that much satisfied with her current relationship, though she tries avoiding exclusive hang-outs with me inviting others because "it's more fun".

I am not sure what would be the best way to go now. Most of all I want to  know if she has some deeper feelings to me. The reason is that I would hate ruining our friendship by pushing too far. But how could I find it out, revealing it in a conversation is not an option since it would be too selfish and I guess she is equally unsure about my intentions. And I think that staying by friends and seeing what happens   I will just be locked in the friend zone.

TL;DR: I have feelings for a girl who has a boyfriend, and I'm unsure if she has feelings for me too. I want to know without ruining our friendship, but I don't know how to find out.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "Dude, you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. You're clearly invested in this girl, but she's already in a relationship. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and focus on building a connection with someone who is single and available. Don't get stuck in the friend zone, it's not worth the emotional baggage."
2. **u/relationship_guru**: "I understand your concerns, but you can't just assume she doesn't have feelings for you because she's in a relationship. People can have feelings for multiple people at once, and it's possible she's not happy in her current relationship. Instead of focusing on whether she has feelings for you, try to build a deeper connection with her as a friend. See if you can find common interests and hobbies to bond over. If she's interested in you, she'll make it clear in her own time."
3. **u/awkward_penguin**: "I'm in a similar situation, and I think I can relate. I would suggest trying to have a casual conversation with her about something unrelated to your feelings. See how she reacts and if she seems more interested in talking to you. Also, try to be more proactive in your interactions with her. Invite her to do things one-on-one, and see if she's receptive to that. Just be careful not to come on too strong, you don't want to scare her off."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with the advice to focus on building a connection as a friend. If you're genuinely interested in her romantically, it's better to be upfront and honest with her. You can't keep your feelings bottled up forever, and it's unfair to her to lead her on. If she's not interested, then at least you'll know and can move on. But if she is interested, then you can start building a relationship together."
5. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "I'm a bot, but I'll give you some advice. It's okay to have feelings for someone who's in a relationship, but you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to work through your feelings and get some guidance on how to navigate this situation. Remember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationships."

TITLE: Is it normal that we haven't had a fight? I'm [19/f] and he's [23/m]

POST: Hi guys. I'm currently in an LDR with a really amazing guy. It's pretty fresh, although we've known each other for over a year. We started dating at the beginning of this year, so we've been together 4-5 months give or take. I realize it's fresh and all, and maybe I just need to give it time, but we haven't had a single argument, fight, or disagreement. I mean, it's not that I *want* one, it's just that I find it odd.

Is it normal? I know everyone says arguing in relationships is completely normal, some people say it's abnormal to *not* fight, but we just haven't. We're both pretty mature and rational, we're both kinda loners and don't do much besides working and talking to each other, and we have quite a lot in common, so I guess there really isn't any reason for us *to* fight but I just feel like it's kinda weird.

TL;DR: I'm in an LDR with a guy and we haven't had a single fight or disagreement. Is this normal? Should I be worried?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not uncommon for couples to go through a period where they're just really in sync and don't have any major disagreements. It doesn't mean you're not compatible or that there won't be conflicts in the future. Just enjoy the ride and don't worry too much about it." - u/RelationshipCoach
* "I think it's great that you're having a smooth ride so far! Maybe you're just really compatible and you're both on the same wavelength. It's not always necessary to have fights to have a healthy relationship. Communication is key, and it sounds like you two are doing that well." - u/SarcasticSally
* "I've been in relationships where we didn't fight much, and it was actually really nice. It's not always about having fights, it's about being able to communicate and work through issues when they arise. If you're both happy and comfortable, that's all that matters." - u/NoFightsNoProblems
* "I think it's normal to feel a little concerned when things are too smooth. It's natural to wonder if there's something wrong or if you're just not challenging each other enough. But honestly, it's possible that you two are just really compatible and you're both on the same page. Don't worry too much about it and just enjoy the ride." - u/RelationshipRookie
* "I'm a bit of a pessimist, but I think it's possible that you two might be avoiding conflicts or not really communicating effectively. It's not always easy to have tough conversations, but it's important for a healthy relationship. Maybe try to have a 'fake' fight just to see how you both handle it? Just kidding, sort of. But seriously, try to have open and honest conversations with each other and see how that goes." - u/PessimisticPete

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments! I think you're all right, it's probably just a phase and we'll have our disagreements eventually. I do think we communicate well, but maybe we're just not pushing each other enough. I'll try to initiate some deeper conversations and see how it goes. Thanks for the advice and reassurance!" - u/OP (Original Poster)

TITLE: TIP my friend by grounding him

POST: The Background:
You read it right, I didn't get him grounded, I actually grounded him. This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.
Events Leading to the Prank:
Now, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.
The Setup:
I got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.
The Execution:
You can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo

TL;DR: I grounded my friend by pretending to be his mom and telling him he got a bad grade in chemistry and that he couldn't go on spring break. He didn't suspect a thing until he got a text from his mom telling him to pay for his broken retainer. I'm pretty proud of myself, but I know some people might not find this funny. What do you guys think? Should I be ashamed of myself? Should I be proud of my prank? Should I just be a good friend and apologize? Help me out, Reddit! 

---

This post is a great example of a well-crafted prank story. The OP (original poster) sets the scene, explains the background and the events leading up to the prank, and then describes the setup and execution of the prank in detail. The use of humor and exaggeration ("I'm pretty proud of myself, but I know some people might not find this funny") adds to the entertainment value of the post.

The post also sparks a lot of discussion and debate in the comments, with some people praising the OP's creativity and humor, while others criticize the prank as being mean-spirited or manipulative. This kind of engagement is exactly what the r/tifu subreddit is all about, and the post is a great example of how a well-crafted story can generate a lot of interest and discussion.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my BF [27M] 3 months, sometimes guys hit on me in front of my BF and insult him in the process. How to react in the moment and afterwards?

POST: Hi Reddit,

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I think I saw a thread with a similar question but I can't seem to find it now so any advice is appreciated.

I started seeing my BF about 3 months ago and he is really incredible. He's witty and kind and I find him incredibly, incredibly handsome and dashing. I think I'm a fairly average looking woman and get hit on from time to time, but I've noticed that it has gotten more aggressive or nasty with my boyfriend around? When a guy hits on me, I'll usually just say thank you but I'm not interested or I have a boyfriend. If my boyfriend is there with me, some guys will give him a full once over and say something along the lines of "This guy?" or "You're outta his league" or "I could show you a better time". Something completely disrespectful to my bf. I don't know where it's coming and he doesn't usually react. I'm not the most confident person so I'll usually just say that was rude or ignore it, but I want to know how I could react or what I could do to reassure my bf in those times. I know if it were me, I'd probably be a bit self conscious or upset but he hasn't said anything. I've tried to bring it up but he brushes it off like it isn't a big deal and maybe it isn't. I don't want to make it seem like a big deal if he's actually not upset, but I also want to make sure he's feeling good about us after this.

Sorry for the rambling! So people of reddit, I'm just wondering how you would like your SO to respond to those guys or what you'd like him/her to do afterwards or say to make you feel secure in the relationship.

Thanks!

TL;DR: BF and I have been together 3 months, sometimes guys hit on me in front of him and insult him. How do I react in the moment and afterwards to reassure him and make him feel good about us?

TITLE: I [21 F] feel like I deserved to get hit by my dad.

POST: First off, I'm on mobile so sorry for any errors.

 I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 and a half years and things are going great between us. We're both seniors in college and we're just honestly so excited to see what life has in store for the both of us. But I'll just admit this here: I've been sneaking him in so we can spend alone time with each other. My parents didn't know any of this was happening until my dad came home super early from work Friday and caught us. I was in the shower while my boyfriend was in my room, which is downstairs. I opened the window and made him hop my fence before my dad could see him. Needless to say, my dad and my mom have been very disappointed in me (for good reason) but my dad built up his anger against me and let it all go today. When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it. My excuse  (albeit a bad one I admit) was that I was helping my aunt and the rest of my family clean up their apartment's party room after the baby shower and I couldn't feel my phone vibrate. When we got home, he made faces at me (like he always does when he's angry at someone) he then asked me who came over Friday. I told him that it was a guy. He asked more questions like how long has this been going on, and why did he leave without seeing him. I answered him like "a while now" and "because I was scared about what you would say". I was crying a little at this point because I was just so scared of him and thats when he lunged at me with his fist. Thankfully my mom came just in time and I told her what happened.

I understand I did something wrong and I really should have told my dad I was dating someone. Because of all these lies and shit I said and done I feel like I really deserved to get punched. I'm also really scared now and I just don't know what to do from here.

TL;DR: I've been sneaking my boyfriend into my house, my dad caught us and got angry, he punched me and I feel like I deserved it.

TITLE: [NSV] Finally broke the compulsive eating cycle

POST: I've been struggling for some time with compulsive overeating habits. I've been sticking to a reasonable 1,700 calorie diet over the last 5 weeks with the aim of making a lifestyle change and hoping that, as a result, my weight would drop too. This morning I finally stepped on the scale and saw I was worthy of my first flair (after 5 weeks) yay!

But then I had a crappy day at work, ate too much for lunch and on the way home all I could think about was a giant, comforting meal of  pizza, or french fries, or mac and cheese, or Chinese food, or anything fatty and greasy. When I got home, my roommate even asked if I wanted to order dinner later and I initially said yes. Then I thought long and hard about what I really wanted. I wanted something that made me feel cozy and comforted, that was warm and rich. So I changed into my favorite pjs, fired up the kettle, made myself a giant mug filled with chicken broth, and curled up in bed. As I sipped the broth, my bad mood passed, I felt satisfied, and no longer wanted take out or crappy food. I made myself a giant salad for dinner instead.

TL;DR: I finally broke the compulsive eating cycle by recognizing my emotional triggers and replacing them with healthier habits. I'm proud of myself for recognizing my cravings and choosing a healthier option. I'm hoping this is the start of a new chapter in my relationship with food.

COMMENTS:

* "Congratulations on recognizing your emotional triggers and making a healthier choice! That's a huge accomplishment. You're not alone in struggling with compulsive eating, and it's amazing that you're taking steps to overcome it."
* "I'm so proud of you for recognizing your cravings and choosing a healthier option! It's not always easy, but it sounds like you're making progress. Keep it up!"
* "I love that you took the time to acknowledge your emotions and find a healthier way to cope. That's a huge step forward. You got this!"
* "I'm so impressed by your self-awareness and ability to make positive changes. You're an inspiration! Keep pushing forward and celebrating your successes."
* "I'm glad you found a healthier way to cope with your emotions. It's not always easy, but it sounds like you're on the right track. Keep going and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just get back on track and keep moving forward."

This post is an example of a successful NSV (Non-Scale Victory) post, where the author shares a positive experience or achievement that is not necessarily related to weight loss, but is still a significant milestone in their journey towards a healthier lifestyle.

TITLE: I am in the financial and insurance industry, but is looking to go back to school to become a vet.  Any suggessions?

POST: I'm not 100% sure if I have what it takes to make this huge change, but I feel like being a Veternarian is something I really want to do in life.  
     A bit of background. I'm currently 24, graduated with a finance degree 3 years ago. I'm currently a financial rep focusing on selling insurance.  Even though I don't hate my job I feel like it doesn't fit my personality.  But I stuck with it for a while because I don't like to quit easily. The idea of becoming a vet happened when a chinchilla of mine 
passed because I didn't take it to the vet in time, and I really love 
animals. People tell me I'm a warm person and great with kids and 
animals. I feel like this is something I came up with myself and not what other want me to be.
     So back to reality, I did a tiny bit of research on this. The closest grad school that has this program is Cornell university (I'm located in NY) I'd probably need to do an undergrad in science or medical field.  I'm a little unsure of 8 more years of school, but I guess if there's no other choice.  Another concern is money, I only have about 10k in bank, I cannot touch my retirement and life insurance money. I'm not sure if I can qualify for any federal grant. I may also need to move back with my parents. One idea I have is to just brokage product with high residuals while I wait to get into a school. I'll also appraciate any insight and experiences from a vet or a person going back to school.

TL;DR: 24 year old finance degree holder looking to switch to become a vet. Currently working as a financial rep, but feel like it's not a good fit. Looking for advice on how to make this transition, including suggestions on schools and financial aid.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] 1 year, LDR trial separation

POST: I need to get this off my chest and get some advice from the community.

My gf and I have been doing long distance for about 5 months and dating for 1 year. We will be living in the same city again come June hence why we decided to give a LDR a try. 

The time we spend together has been great and we usually see each other for long weekends every couple of weeks. 

A few months ago I found out that my gf cheated on me (she kissed another guy in a club). I decided to give her a last chance but if I'm entirely honest, since it happened I have not taken the relationship as seriously as I used to. 

This weekend, I went down to see her (hadn't seen her in 3 weeks). I got her flowers, chocolates and a card for valentine's day. She spent most of the day with her friends and I didn't even get a card in return. In the evening I cooked her a nice dinner, then we had a bit of a fall out and she spent the rest of the evening hanging out with friends. 

Needless to say, this morning I was pretty fed up and have initiated a 2 week "trial break-up". She was really upset. We won't be talking for 2 weeks and will then meet up to decide whether to end it or continue.

Am I being perfectly reasonable here or am I just being overly sensitive? Obviously I love her to bits and the text above is only really showing her in bad light - but these are the things I'm picking up on. Our sex life isn't great either. She has a slight cold and so there was no love making this weekend (even after not seeing each other for 3 weeks).

TL;DR: LDR for 5 months, cheated on me, not taking relationship seriously since, recent disagreements and lack of effort from her side. Initiated 2 week trial break-up. Am I being reasonable or just being overly sensitive?

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not being unreasonable at all. You've been patient and given her a second chance, but it seems like she's not putting in the effort to make it work. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize your relationship."
* "I think you're being a bit too harsh. A 2 week break-up might be a bit extreme. Have you tried talking to her about how you're feeling instead of just initiating a break-up?"
* "I'm not saying you're wrong, but have you considered that maybe she's just going through a tough time and doesn't know how to show her appreciation? Maybe she's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't know how to prioritize your relationship. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation about how you're feeling?"
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. You're expecting her to be perfect and put in all the effort. Relationships are about compromise and communication. Maybe you need to work on your own communication skills and stop expecting her to read your mind."
* "I think you're being reasonable. You've given her a second chance and she's not taking it seriously. You deserve someone who will put in the effort to make it work. If she's not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to move on."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are mixed, with some people agreeing that the OP is being reasonable and others suggesting that he might be being too harsh or too sensitive. The post highlights the challenges of long-distance relationships and the importance of communication and compromise in any relationship. Ultimately, the decision to continue or end the relationship is up to the OP and his girlfriend, and it will depend on their individual circumstances and priorities.

TITLE: Would like some advice and help on an apology based on depressive behavior and women,to women. Women who have had depression would be a HUGE help

POST: About a year and a half ago, I found I hand depression. Now depression to a person that has never had it and just hears it might label it as being sad and angry and down alot. 
Depression is actually much more than that, and it is hard to explain so I have a link here on 13 things to remember about a person with depression 

Basically, without creating an excuse, I was a bit rude,pushy and angry plus other things to some wonderful ladies I have met. One who has been absolutely incredible and I appreciate so much. I like talking to them and hanging out with them when I can. They have helped alot, I am getting better 

I dont ask here because I would not treat a women different when apologizing or that I want to sound stupid, I just want them to feel like my apology was genuine not like im giving them crap and will still be that way. What does everyone suggest I say? Do I tell them I have depression?

TL;DR: I have depression, I was a bit rude and pushy to some ladies, I want to apologize and make sure they know it wasn't personal and that I'm getting better.

* "I would suggest being honest and open about your depression, but also being clear that it's not an excuse for your behavior. You could say something like, 'I want to apologize for my behavior, and I want to acknowledge that it was unacceptable. I'm working on getting better and I'm grateful for your understanding and support.'"
* "It's great that you're thinking about how to apologize and make things right. You could try to have a conversation with the women you've been rude to and explain how you're feeling and what you're doing to get better. Be honest and sincere, and I'm sure they will appreciate your effort."

Overall, this post is a great example of how to seek advice and be respectful of others' feelings and experiences. The OP is showing that he is willing to listen and learn, and that he values the relationships he has with the women he has interacted with.

TITLE: Reddit, what's the stupidest thing that you've done that has caused, or could have caused a severe injury to you?

POST: With me, it just happened yesterday.  I woke up early in the morning with sharp stomach pains, thinking I had to pee or something and that my bladder was just too full.  After going to the bathroom it still hurt really bad and I was literally sobbing.

I didn't want to go to urgent care because I was sure they'd send me home saying I just had super bad gas or something else embarrassing.  Thankfully my boyfriend talked me into it, and upon finding that Urgent care wasn't open yet we went to the ER and got there within an hour after my pains started.  After getting there they started to calm down, so now I was even more sure that it was somethign dumb and I was just going to be embarrassed.

After getting bloodwork done and a cat scan, the doctor comes in and informs me that I have appendicitis and need my appendix removed.  I was in surgery by 12:30 and have been on pain killers since yesterday and will be released either tonight or tomorrow.

So, if it wasn't for my boyfriend being more stubborn than me I could have had my appendix rupture and died, since we only have one car and he brought me to the hospital 20 minutes before he would have had to leave for work.

TL;DR: Had appendicitis, didn't go to urgent care, boyfriend convinced me to go to ER, got surgery, almost died.

TITLE: Confused virgin, initiating everything with girlfriend, feeling bad afterwards.

POST: Okay....so me and this girl, we've been dating for two months now. She's a virgin, and I'm a virgin. Hell, she's so innocent, it's not even funny.

But, we've recently started to get a lot more physical. From about the second week, we've been sleeping together. As in, we would cuddle and then sleep in the same bed. We might make out a little bit, but it was mostly the cuddling and the sleeping.

Then, I started with the dry-humping, and she reciprocated, and clothes started coming off. Only above the waist, however. I quickly learned how to properly take off a bra.

And then, just within this last week, we moved to third base. It started with me rubbing outside of the shorts she wore to bed, and then I asked if she minded me moving inside the shorts, and she said no, so I did. And she's given me a handjob before too. Mostly, though, I feel like it's been me.

And I want it, in the moment. And she wants it--she never hasn't wanted it. But, afterwards, I always feel like shit. I wouldn't say I regret it, but I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for initiating it, and for almost pushing the boundaries.

I guess, what I'm asking here more than anything, is that should this be happening? Is this one of those things that should just *feel* right from the moment you're doing it? Like, when you're doing it and when you're not? As bad as this sounds, could it be a sign that she's not really "the one" and that, knowing that, I should break up with her?

TL;DR: I'm a virgin, dating a virgin, and we've been getting physical. I initiate everything, and afterwards, I feel bad. Should this be happening? Is it a sign that she's not the one?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 2 months in and you're already feeling guilty about initiating intimacy? That's a good sign that you're taking things seriously and respecting your girlfriend's boundaries. Just remember to communicate with her about how you're feeling and make sure you're both on the same page."
* "I think you're overthinking this. It's normal to feel a little guilty or unsure after initiating intimacy, especially if it's your first time. But it sounds like you're both comfortable with each other and are taking things at your own pace. Just be honest with your girlfriend about how you're feeling and work through it together."
* "I'm a little concerned that you're initiating everything and not really giving your girlfriend a chance to take the lead. Maybe try to mix it up a bit and see if she's interested in taking things in a different direction. And honestly, if you're feeling bad about it, maybe you should take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to initiate intimacy and it's okay to feel a little guilty afterwards. Just make sure you're communicating with your girlfriend and that you're both comfortable with each other. And honestly, if you're feeling bad about it, maybe you should talk to your girlfriend about it and see if there's anything you can do to make each other feel more comfortable."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. It's okay to initiate intimacy and it's okay to feel a little guilty afterwards. Just remember that it's normal to feel a little unsure or uncomfortable after doing something new, especially if it's your first time. And honestly, if you're feeling bad about it, maybe you should talk to your girlfriend about it and see if there's anything you can do to make each other feel more comfortable."

TITLE: Bestfriend [M/19] gets girlfriend, drops me [F/19] like a rock

POST: We've been friends for about 4(ish?) years. We've always been pretty close. Unfortunately, whenever he gets a girlfriend he starts ignoring me. This time is worse than usual though, since we're both in college in different states.

Basically, this summer we took a class at my school (cheaper for him since his school is out of state) and he stayed at my house (because gas). Class lasts a month. When the class ends, he goes back to school and I pretty much haven't heard from him since. 

Its been a month, and I've tried texting him and calling him but he ignores me. He called once to say he was sorry and make excuses (he's "busy") and he referenced things I told him in my text messages, so obviously he's reading them, but just not bothering to respond.

I just don't understand what's going on with him. I go from talking to him every day to being completely cut off. I can't just talk to him about it because he'll just ignore me. I don't know if its because he's got a gf now so he doesn't need meanymore, or if we're just doing the whole "growing apart" thing way more rapidly than I expected. 

I really just want to get some perspective on this, because its really upsetting me. Also, last school year he didn't have a girlfriend and we talked pretty much every day. So I'm just assuming this has something to do with her.

TL;DR: Bestfriend [M/19] gets girlfriend, drops me like a rock, ignores me after a month of not talking. I'm really upset and don't know what's going on.

TITLE: I [16 M] want to supportmy grieving girlfriend[15F] after an abortion, but she wants space.

POST: I understand that she needs space to grieve, and that she needs to come to grips with what happened, after the abortion, i was her only shoulder to cry on,of course her parents were there to support and talk to, but she didn't want to due to fear, shame and embarrassment. 

So after the abortion we thought it would be a breeze, that wasn't the case, it happened around 3/4 months ago and our relationship hasn't been the same, for around 3 months after it was constant battling at eachother and tears of what happened but i'd always support her.

My mum and a close friend have told me to not text her at all, wait for her to come to, open the door, then come in and pick everything up again. But i had to text her and just let her know im waiting for her and would never abandon her, any hour of the day i would be here. The reason im worrying is because she has one therapy session a week, and she doesn't talk to her mum about it as much as she should, she's even admitted shes depressed and i could see it.

Her exact reply to my text was "That definitely put a smile on my face! So nice to hear that fro you, you mean everything to me still and just for you to understand that honestly makes me the happiest person alive"

The problem is, i don't want her bottling everything up and not speaking to anyone, i hate knowing she could be sat upset, feeling alone, and of course i don't want,after all this space, her to think i was never here from her, feelings to go,and to get a wrong impression of me.

What shall i do?
Should i call or text her at all?
Should i just let her come to me?
Thanks!

TL;DR: My girlfriend had an abortion 3-4 months ago and I've been trying to support her through it. She wants space, but I'm worried she's bottling everything up and not speaking to anyone. I want to be there for her, but I don't know if I should be reaching out to her or just waiting for her to come to me.

TITLE: So I just found out my girlfriend is unhappy in our relationship [4-1/2 yrs, 24/m 23/f]

POST: I really hope you guys can help me on this one.

So I'm very technology savvy. I have worked in computer repair and the IT field for the last 7 years.

I met my girlfriend her freshmen year of college (I was a sophomore transfer) and we've been dating each other our entire college career. She's graduating this year (I graduated last year and came back for an MS). I worked on her computer about a month ago because it was running slow, freezing, etc. so I looked at it over a night. While I had her computer, my curiosity got the best of me.

I found myself in a junk folder that had a lot of misc stuff in it, under which I found a pro-con list that turned out to be about myself; the things she liked (pros) and the things she didn't like (cons). I saw it and it kind of shook me up. I didn't sleep well that night, as I drempt she broke up with me. The next morning I told her about the dream. She consoled me and said she wasn't breaking up with me anytime soon.

Moving on, I found she had created an account on a dating advice forum, and I found all of her posts. The first ones were from back when she was in high school. Later on she posted about us. The most recent one was a day before our four year anniversary. It was asking for advice on how to break up with me because she is no longer happy in the relationship. In it she states that some of her friends and family have been telling her to break up with me for well over a year. We're involved in a lot of the same things, so it would be awkward for both of us to break up.

It's now 8 months later. I have never seen any signs from her personally that she is displeased with our relationship. I love her so much, but now that I've seen this, I feel she just puts up a front to make me happy and not make life a living hell while we still spend time together.

TL;DR: I found a pro-con list about myself on my girlfriend's computer, and then discovered she had been posting on a dating advice forum about how to break up with me because she's unhappy in the relationship. I feel like she's been putting on a front to make me happy and not make life a living hell while we still spend time together.

I'm torn between confronting her about it and just letting it go. I love her, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where one person is unhappy. I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to have a calm and honest conversation with her about what you've found. Don't accuse her of anything, just express your feelings and concerns. Remember that people can change their minds and feelings over time, and it's possible she's been feeling unhappy for a while but didn't know how to bring it up."
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. Just because she had a list of pros and cons doesn't mean she's actively looking to break up with you. And the dating advice forum post could have been just a hypothetical exercise. You need to talk to her and get her perspective on things."
* "I would suggest taking a step back and reflecting on your own feelings and actions in the relationship. Have you been taking her for granted or not making an effort to communicate with her? Sometimes people feel unhappy in relationships because they're not being heard or seen."
* "I think you should just let it go. You've already found out what you needed to know, and now you can either choose to stay in the relationship or leave. But if you confront her about it, it could lead to a lot of drama and potentially ruin the relationship."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her, but also be prepared to listen to her perspective and feelings. It's possible she's been feeling unhappy for a while and didn't know how to bring it up, or that she's been trying to work through her feelings and hasn't found a solution yet. Don't assume you know what she's thinking or feeling without talking to her directly."

TITLE: My (19 M) Girlfriend (17 F) of 3 years reveals that she was much more sexually active before we dated than I previously thought. How do I get over this?

POST: I know its stupid and I know its just sex but Ive never felt so much grief in my entire life. I guess I feel this way because she was my first and only and knowing that she's been with kind of hurts.  

I feel stupid for feeling so upset about it.  How do I get over it so I can move on with our relationship?  I don't even see her the same since she told me and I feel like I'm pathetic for not being 100% okay.

She's already given me an STD but I just assumed it was s fluke because she told me she'd only had sex 3 other times.

Help please

TL;DR: My 17-year-old girlfriend of 3 years reveals she was much more sexually active before we dated than I thought. I'm feeling hurt and betrayed. How do I get over it?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not stupid for feeling this way. It's natural to feel hurt and betrayed. You've been with her for 3 years and thought you knew her. This revelation can be a huge blow to your trust and feelings of intimacy. Take time to process your emotions and have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling."
* "It's not about being '100% okay' with it. It's about being honest with yourself and your partner about your feelings. You have every right to feel hurt and betrayed. Don't be afraid to express your emotions and work through this together."
* "You're not pathetic for feeling this way. You're human. It's normal to feel vulnerable and hurt when someone reveals something that challenges your perception of them. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being during this time."
* "It's not about the number of people she's been with, it's about the fact that she didn't tell you the truth. You deserve honesty and respect in your relationship. Have a conversation with her about why she didn't tell you and work on rebuilding trust."
* "You're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have been in similar situations and have come out stronger on the other side. Take time to reflect on your feelings and priorities, and don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need it."

TITLE: X-post from r/relationships: [Throwaway] My housemate has been evicted, but seems to be refusing to collect his stuff. What now? (United Kingdom)

POST: Am located in the UK. 

Two weeks ago, my housemate was evicted after a spate of horrible behaviour and 'forgetting' to pay his rent. The landlord is taking him to court over the late rent payments (which amount to several thousand pounds), which he didn't think he'd have to pay if he moved out right away.

He has left everything apart from his laptop. That includes bedding, clothes and loads of personal items that I'm sure are worth a lot of money. He doesn't seem to understand that he needs to come and get it, saying that he'll "come when he wants". As far as I know, he hasn't even contacted any housing agencies to try and get a new place.

I don't want to be stuck with his stuff until he finds a new place; I have new tenants moving in! I've contacted the city council but they just said to wait and see if he came to get it, which wasn't really helpful.

Does Reddit have any advice at all? Anything would help!

The general consensious on r/relationships is to box it up and leave in on the curb after a set date. Does this sound okay?

TL;DR: Housemate was evicted, left most of his stuff behind, refuses to collect it. What do I do?

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I'd suggest contacting the local council again and asking for their assistance in dealing with the situation. They may be able to provide guidance on what to do next or even send someone to collect the items.

2. **u/LegalBeagle**: You could try contacting the landlord and asking them to take responsibility for the items left behind. They may be able to arrange for someone to collect them or store them until the housemate returns.

3. **u/UKLawyer**: In the UK, you can serve a notice on the housemate requiring them to collect their belongings within a certain timeframe (usually 7-14 days). If they fail to do so, you can dispose of the items as you see fit. You may want to consult with a solicitor to ensure you're following the correct procedure.

4. **u/throwaway789**: I'd recommend taking photos of the items and keeping them in a safe place. If the housemate tries to claim that you've damaged or stolen their belongings, you'll have evidence to prove otherwise.

5. **u/throwaway456**: You could try contacting a local charity or thrift store and asking if they'd be willing to take the items off your hands. They may be able to use them or sell them to raise funds for their organization.

6. **u/throwaway321**: I'd suggest keeping a record of all correspondence with the housemate, including dates, times, and details of any conversations you have with them. This will help you prove that you've made reasonable efforts to contact them and resolve the situation.

7. **u/throwaway111**: You could try contacting the local police and asking for their assistance in dealing with the situation. They may be able to help you resolve the issue or provide guidance on what to do next.

8. **u/throwaway222**: I'd recommend taking a photo of the items and posting it on social media, saying something like "Housemate left all this behind when they got evicted. Anyone know what to do?" You never know, someone might be able to offer some advice or even take some of the items off your hands.

9. **u/throwaway333**: You could try contacting a local storage company and asking if they'd be willing to store the items for a short period of time. This might give you some extra time to figure out what to do with them.

10. **u/throwaway444**: I'd suggest keeping the items in a safe place until the housemate returns or until you've exhausted all other options. You don't want to be accused of stealing or damaging their belongings, even if they are being unreasonable.

11. **u/throwaway555**: You could try contacting the local council again and asking if they can provide any additional support or guidance. They may be able to offer some advice or resources to help you resolve the situation.

12. **u/throwaway666**: I'd recommend taking a deep breath and trying to stay calm. Dealing with a difficult housemate can be stressful, but it's not worth getting worked up over. Just focus on finding a solution and moving forward.

13. **u/throwaway777**: You could try contacting a local charity or organization that helps people in crisis. They may be able to provide some guidance or support to help the housemate get back on their feet.

14. **u/throwaway888**: I'd suggest keeping a record of all correspondence with the housemate, including dates, times, and details of any conversations you have with them. This will help you prove that you've made reasonable efforts to contact them and resolve the situation.

15. **u/throwaway999**: You could try contacting the local police and asking for their assistance in dealing with the situation. They may be able to help you resolve the issue or provide guidance on what to do next.

The general consensus is to contact the local council, landlord, or a solicitor for guidance on what to do next. Some users also suggest taking photos of the items, keeping a record of correspondence, and considering contacting a local charity or thrift store. Others recommend staying calm and focusing on finding a solution. The post has received over 100 comments and has been upvoted over 500 times. The OP has not yet responded to any of the comments.

TITLE: Reddit, What is the craziest/most hilarious thing you have done with your immediate family?

POST: So being a kid about to leave for college in a week, I was just thinking of all the ridiculous things that have gone on with my family and friends. One of the main things that still sticks in my mind is the one time that my dad took the entire family on vacation up to a lake in Central PA. On the last night, my dad had gotten properly drunk with some of the locals. On his way back he insisted that we go "quilling". 
For those not familiar with this sport, it involves a car, a bunch of drunk friends, some towels, and a shit load of porcupines. Basically, my dad convinced my mom to drive around backroads at about 230 in the morning trying to find porcupines. When we saw some on the road, my friend and i would jump out, chase them down and whip them with towels to see how many of their quills we could get. (their quills grow back and its painless for them, bring on PETA). All in all we came back with 200 some quills and a bunch of good memories.

TL;DR: My dad took us on a drunk quilling adventure with porcupines in the middle of the night.

TITLE: I[22M] Completely hung up on friend[25F]

POST: Hey Reddit!

So, for some back story I've been going out with this girl for sometime. We met about a year ago, went out a few times, i'd say we hit it off and I definitely liked her. We decided not to "date" for a few different reason but did the friends with benefits thing for a few months. She ended up trying to see someone else a few months ago and contact pretty much stopped between us. We would talk here and there, all started by me, but that was it for the most part.

Around mid January we started to casually do things again. Turns out what she was doing with this other guy didn't work out and I was happy because I had my friend back. We have since gone out a few times and some of the nights we even ended up hooking up again. Coming to last weekend, we went out and at the end of the night it was awkward. I tried to initiate a kiss with her and she didn't want much to do with it. The next day we talked for a while through text, and decided that were good friends and doing things probably isn't going to end up well, which i agree with.

My problem though is that I am so hung up on her. I definitely have more feelings for her than she realizes and i'm in a strange spot and have no idea what to do. She is an extremely important person to me, and I don't want her out of my life but I am killing myself with these thoughts and feelings that I keep having. I know i have to "man up" and get over it, but how am I supposed to do it when we are good friends, and I don't want to stop talking or hanging out with her in that capacity?

TL;DR: I've been friends with benefits with this girl for a while, we took a break, got back together, and now I'm hung up on her. We're good friends, but I have feelings for her and I don't know how to get over it without losing her as a friend.

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, I feel you. It's tough to get over someone you care about, especially when you're still close friends. Have you considered talking to her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's not aware of the depth of your emotions and could help you work through this. Just be honest and open with her, and see what she says."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "Hey there! I'm a bot, but I've been trained to help with relationship advice. It sounds like you're struggling with unrequited feelings for your friend. Have you considered taking a step back and focusing on yourself for a bit? Sometimes, taking a break from the situation can help you gain some perspective and clarity. Additionally, it might be helpful to explore what you're hoping to get out of this situation. Are you looking for a romantic relationship, or are you just trying to hold onto the connection you have with her?"
3. **throwaway789012**: "I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's not easy. But, I think you need to be honest with yourself about what you want. Do you really want to be friends with her, or do you want something more? If it's the former, then you need to accept that she's not interested in a romantic relationship with you and move on. If it's the latter, then you need to have a real conversation with her about your feelings and see what she says. Either way, you can't keep stringing along in limbo. It's not fair to either of you."

**Subreddit's Response:**

The subreddit community responded with a mix of advice and empathy. Many users encouraged the OP to be honest with himself and with his friend about his feelings, while others suggested taking a step back and focusing on himself for a bit. Some users also shared their own experiences with unrequited feelings and offered words of encouragement.

TITLE: Reddit, can you help? Bridesmaid trying to get to wedding that starts nr Baton Rouge in eight hours, stranded in Memphis due to cancelled flight.

POST: Writing this from London, feeling completely helpless. Two of my friends are getting married later today near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one of the bridesmaids is currently stuck in Memphis due to the bad weather. Her flight was cancelled last night, she's been on stand by for flights all morning. At the moment, Delta are trying to get her on a flight to Atlanta and then on to Baton Rouge, but it won't get her there until very late in the day and there's a good chance she'll miss the wedding. Still not confirmed that she has a place on the plane from Atlanta...
Can anyone help?

TL;DR: Bridesmaid stuck in Memphis due to cancelled flight, trying to get to Baton Rouge for wedding in 8 hours. Any help or advice appreciated!

---

**Reddit's Response:**

**Top Comment:** "Hey OP, I'm not a travel expert, but I can try to help. Have you considered renting a car or taking a shuttle service from Memphis to Baton Rouge? It's about a 7-hour drive, but it might be faster than waiting for a flight. You can check out companies like Enterprise or Hertz for car rentals. Alternatively, you could look into shuttle services like Go Yellow Checker or Baton Rouge Shuttle. They might be able to get her to the wedding on time. Good luck!"

**Other Comments:**

* "I'm not sure if this is an option, but have you considered chartering a private plane? It might be expensive, but it could be the only way to get her to the wedding on time."
* "I've had bad experiences with Delta in the past. Have you tried contacting other airlines to see if they have any available flights?"
* "I'm not sure what the weather is like in Memphis, but if it's bad enough to cancel flights, it might be worth considering taking a train or bus to Baton Rouge. Amtrak and Greyhound both have routes from Memphis to Baton Rouge."
* "I'm a pilot and I've had to deal with cancelled flights before. If she's on standby, it's unlikely she'll get on a flight today. Have you considered booking a last-minute hotel room in Atlanta and then taking a shuttle or renting a car to get to Baton Rouge?"

**OP's Response:**

"Wow, thank you so much for all the suggestions! I'll definitely look into renting a car or taking a shuttle service. Chartering a private plane is definitely out of our budget, but I'll try contacting other airlines to see if they have any available flights. And yes, the weather in Memphis is terrible, so taking a train or bus might be a good option too. I'll keep you all updated on how things go. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: F[24] in a long distance relationship with M[23]; How do I deal with this?

POST: My boyfriend of two years and I had been in a long distance relationship even before I came to settle in California. But before I settled in this country (for my mom's sake) we were doing okay with the distance. I occasionally visit his country when I have the time and the frequency of our skype chats were on a daily basis.

He hated the idea that I had stay here because I have mommy issues. We were okay on my first week here but then he started to drift apart. He doesn't even go online anymore or even try to on most days. He tells me that he's busy with school work and that he wants to pass this semester so that he can graduate. Although before he makes it a point to say hello and chat. Now, I do all the effort with long distance texting but he doesn't seem to want to reply to me so we could talk about it again.

It's sad that he's not putting effort anymore and I need advice on how to deal with this. Should I break up with him? 

(He also had problems expressing himself and I think he'd want me to break it off rather than he do this. )

TL;DR: Long distance relationship with boyfriend of 2 years. He's not putting effort into communication and I'm feeling sad and lonely. Should I break up with him?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's checked out of the relationship. If he's not making an effort to communicate with you, it's likely because he's lost interest. You deserve better than someone who doesn't care about your feelings or well-being. I would consider breaking up with him and focusing on yourself."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you're recognizing the signs of a dying relationship. It's not uncommon for people to drift apart when they're in a long distance relationship. However, it's clear that your boyfriend is not making an effort to communicate with you. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. If he's not willing to listen or make changes, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship."
3. **u/sadpanda123**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like your boyfriend is not prioritizing your relationship and that's not okay. You deserve someone who will make an effort to communicate with you and prioritize your feelings. I would suggest taking some time for yourself and focusing on your own well-being. You don't deserve to be treated like this."
4. **u/longdistancerelationship**: "I've been in a long distance relationship for a few years now and I can attest that it's not easy. However, it's clear that your boyfriend is not making an effort to communicate with you. I would suggest setting boundaries and having open and honest conversations with him about how you're feeling. If he's not willing to listen or make changes, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship."
5. **u/relationshipcoach**: "It's great that you're recognizing the signs of a dying relationship. It's not uncommon for people to drift apart when they're in a long distance relationship.

TITLE: (23/f) I have a huge crush (33/m) on my ex-teacher. Went out on a date and fucked up REALLY REALLY BAD. Should I apologize or chalk it up as a loss?

POST: We flirted all throughout class in the most passive ways and then I asked him out on the last day and he said sure! We went to this bar and I got too drunk off of two drinks. I don't usually drink hard alcohol and he said I could have beer but for some reason I said "No, that's fine" and proceeded to drink gin and absinthe... I DON"T KNOW WHY I DID THIS. I really like him. He is so intelligent and sexy.. Then I got too drunk and started saying everything that is awful. Like how I didn't like the kids in our class, I live with my parents, my parents have money, how I *WASN'T* planning on telling him about all this. JESUS CHIST. And this is only the stuff I remember. I texted him when I got him and told him I had a good time and we should do it again. He said he did too and sure. I'm not sure he's just saying that or....? I asked him to go to coffee Sunday (yesterday) and the event happened Monday. I know really close together, but I wanted to apologize to his face. Should I? Like:

I am so sorry for Monday. I am embarrassed. I think you are intelligent, interesting and sexy and I would like to get to know you more. Please don't judge me on Monday and go to the art museum or zoo or something before you leave the state? 

If he doesn't text back in a week is a text apology as a last resort ok? 

Yes, I wrote it out. I am so fucking embarrassed...

TL;DR: I went on a date with my ex-teacher, got too drunk, said some awful things, and now I'm not sure if I should apologize or just chalk it up as a loss. Help!

* "Girl, you're not alone. We've all had those nights. Apologize and mean it. Show him you're willing to learn from your mistakes and grow."
* "I think you should apologize, but also acknowledge that you were out of line. You can't just blame the drinks and expect him to forgive you. Take responsibility for your actions."
* "Honestly, if he's still willing to talk to you after that, he's a saint. But seriously, apologize and be genuine about it. You never know, he might be willing to give you another chance."
* "I think you should take a step back and reflect on why you felt the need to say all those things. Was it because you were trying to impress him or because you were trying to hide something?

TITLE: [17/M]How do I start a conversation with a girl[16/m] who goes to my school and climbing gym.

POST: I joined a rock climbing gym over the summer and climbed a month before school started. When I first started to go there I saw this girl but didn't have any feelings for here. School then started up and noticed that she went to my school. I pass her in the halls a few times a day, which is always a little awkward when I kinda know someone but never really talked to them. One day out of no where I just started to really like the way this girl acted and looked, I have no idea why. I want to talk to her but I don't want to come off as forcing a conversation or some creep.

TL;DR: I like a girl who goes to my school and climbing gym, but I don't know how to start a conversation with her.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm a girl and I'll give you some advice. It's great that you're interested in her, but don't try to force a conversation. Just be yourself and see if you have any common interests. Maybe ask her about the climbing gym or school. Keep it casual and don't put too much pressure on the conversation."
2. **climbing_guru**: "I'm a regular at the climbing gym too! I've seen you around. If you want to talk to her, try striking up a conversation about climbing. Ask her about her favorite routes or what she likes about climbing. It's a great way to break the ice and show your shared interest."
3. **awkward_penguin**: "I'm a bit of a shy guy too, but I found that just being genuine and friendly can go a long way. If you see her in the halls, just say hi and ask how her day is going. Don't overthink it too much and just be yourself. Good luck!"
4. **relationship_advisor**: "OP, it's great that you're taking the time to think about how to approach this girl. Remember that it's okay to be nervous, but don't let that stop you from trying. Just be respectful and considerate of her feelings. If she's not interested, that's okay too. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."
5. **throwaway123456**: "I think it's great that you're interested in her, but don't forget to respect her boundaries. If she's not interested in talking to you, that's okay. Don't take it personally and just move on. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll try to start with a casual conversation about climbing and see where it goes from there. I'll also try to be myself and not put too much pressure on the conversation. And if it doesn't work out, I'll just move on and focus on other things. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: Feeling really empty for the past little while.

POST: Hey guys,

I'm an 18 year old high school student who's in their final year. About 2 months ago I was accepted to my dream school, and as such I'll be going off their in August. I'm extremely happy about it, it's one of the best schools in my country, and the place itself is beautiful. Needless to say, this relatively early university acceptance was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. 

But for whatever reason, I can't find it in myself to be happy. Most kids my age would be ecstatic and hopeful for the future. And while I am happy that I'll be moving out on my own, I can't help but feel incredible emptiness. Every night I just waste away the day browsing internet forums or listening to music. My usual hobby of videogames can't grip me like it used to; any time I try a new game I lose interest after a few hours, maybe a few days if I'm lucky. The only thing that can hold my attention for more than a few days is reading books, but even with that, I have to take a break every half hour or else I zone out.

Do you guys have any advice for me? I have nothing to be sad about, my life is great as it is, but at the same time I don't feel happy about anything. I usually feel comfortable with my friends, but we've been talking less and less recently, due to conflicting schedules at school.

TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old high school student who's accepted to my dream school, but I'm feeling empty and can't find anything to be happy about.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

1. **It's normal to feel this way**: "Congratulations on getting accepted into your dream school! It's normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure about what's next. You're not alone in feeling this way. Take some time to process your emotions and don't be too hard on yourself."
2. **Find new hobbies**: "Try new things! You mentioned videogames aren't holding your attention like they used to. Have you considered trying new hobbies like painting, writing, or photography? You might find something that sparks your interest and helps you feel more fulfilled."
3. **Connect with others**: "It's great that you have friends, but it's understandable that you're not talking as much due to conflicting schedules. Try reaching out to them and scheduling regular hangouts. You can also join clubs or groups that align with your interests to meet new people."
4. **Practice self-care**: "Take care of yourself! Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. Sometimes, our mental health can be affected by our physical health. Try to prioritize self-care and see if that helps improve your mood."
5. **Seek professional help**: "If you're feeling persistently empty and unhappy, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies. Don't be afraid to reach out for help – it's a sign of strength, not weakness."

---

**ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:**

* "I went through a similar phase after I got accepted into my dream school. It was like I was waiting for something to happen, but I didn't know what. It took me a while to realize that I was just feeling anxious about the future. Try to focus on the present and enjoy the little things."
* "I'm glad you're being honest about your feelings! It's okay to not be okay, even when things seem great on the surface. Remember that it's normal to feel uncertain or overwhelmed, and that it's okay to take your time figuring things out."
* "Have you considered talking to a guidance counselor or a trusted teacher about your feelings? They might be able to offer some valuable advice or support. Don't be afraid to reach out – they're there to help you!"

TITLE: I [26M] just started a new relationship, but not sure if I can trust her [26F]. Is this a red flag?

POST: So I met this girl at my best friends wedding two months ago. We really hit it off and I went to visit her across the country a week ago. I'm head over heels for her, but I don't want to get hurt.

A particular situation is nagging at me though. Last night she went to a movie in the park with her neighbor and his friend. I met them on my journey out there and thought they were weird but harmless.

She tells me today that they all got pretty drunk and one of the guys was hitting on her, the neighbor kept trying to put his arm around her, and one of their friends tried to make a move to kiss her at the end of the night. She said that she declined all of these advances and I don't have any reason to doubt her, but what bothers me the most is that the she let the guy who tried to kiss her sleep on her couch.

She says she's only interested in me and that she found those guys, desperate and creepy, but it bothers me that she didn't see it to begin with and that she didn't just flat out kick them out of her apartment. Is she just overly flirty/nice. Is this a red flag?

I already have trust issues and the LDR thing is compounding them. I'd love to have an honest discussion about it, but don't want to seem controlling or overly jealous.

TL;DR: Girlfriend went to a movie with her neighbor and his friend, got drunk, and one of the guys tried to kiss her. She let him sleep on her couch. I'm worried about her judgment and trustworthiness. Is this a red flag?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're overreacting a bit. She didn't let him sleep on her couch because she wanted to, she did it because she was drunk and didn't think it through. It's not a huge deal. You're just being paranoid because of your trust issues."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not a huge deal, but it does show a lack of judgment. Maybe have an open and honest conversation with her about it and see how she reacts. If she's defensive or dismissive, that could be a red flag."
* "I think you're right to be concerned. It's not just about the situation itself, but how she handled it. If she's not willing to listen to your concerns and work through them with you, that could be a sign of bigger issues in the relationship."
* "I think you're being too focused on the specific situation and not considering the bigger picture. Has she shown you any other red flags? Has she been dishonest with you or broken any of your boundaries? If not, maybe this is just a minor issue that can be worked through."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're in a long distance relationship and you're already struggling with trust issues. Maybe this is just a sign that you're not ready for a serious relationship. You deserve someone who is trustworthy and respectful, and if she's not willing to work through this with you, maybe it's time to re-evaluate the relationship."
* "I think you're being too hard on her. She's a 26-year-old woman who made a mistake. We've all made mistakes. Maybe instead of focusing on the specific situation, you could try to have a conversation with her about what you're feeling and why. Maybe she's not even aware of how her actions are affecting you."

This post and its comments demonstrate the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication and trust.

TITLE: Feeling discouraged and a little lost - Need some advice.

POST: I'm sure these types of posts crop of from time to time, so I apologize if you've seen this all before.

I'm looking for a little advice.  To begin, I'll give you some background information.  I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force.  While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations.  I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have.  I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology.  I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010.  I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010.  I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers.  I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money.  I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking.  I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS?  A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

Thanks in advance; sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR: I'm feeling lost and unsure about my career path.  I want to work in computers, but I'm not sure where to start.  I've got a background in electronics, but I'm not sure if it's relevant.  Any advice would be appreciated.

RESUME:

[Insert resume here]

TITLE: Reddit, when I was young I was tested for my IQ and I was told it was in the upper 140s. Nowadays, I don't feel as smart. Is video games really killing my intelligence?

POST: When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again. So, what is my problem? Is there anything I can do to regain my sharpness and should I start cutting out my excessive hours of video games?

TL;DR: I was tested for my IQ as a kid and got a score in the upper 140s. Now, I don't feel as smart and my mind feels sluggish. I'm wondering if playing video games for hours a day is affecting my intelligence.

**Top comments:**

1. "I think it's important to note that IQ scores are not necessarily a measure of intelligence, but rather a measure of cognitive ability. Intelligence is a complex trait that can't be reduced to a single number. That being said, it's possible that your gaming habits are affecting your cognitive abilities, but it's also possible that it's just a normal part of life. Have you considered taking a break from gaming and seeing if that improves your mental clarity?"
2. "I'm no expert, but I think it's possible that your brain is just adapting to the constant stimulation from video games. Our brains are wired to respond to novelty and excitement, so it's possible that the constant stream of new information and challenges from video games is keeping your brain in a state of high alert, making it harder for you to focus and think clearly when you're not gaming. Have you tried taking a break from gaming and seeing if that helps?"
3. "I think it's also worth considering that your expectations and self-perception may be playing a role in how you feel about your intelligence. When you were younger, you were likely in a situation where you were constantly being challenged and praised for your abilities, which can create a sense of confidence and self-efficacy. As you've gotten older, you may be facing new challenges and not feeling as confident or capable, which can make you feel like you're not as smart. Have you considered talking to a therapist about your feelings and seeing if that can help you work through some of these issues?"
4. "I'm not saying that video games are necessarily bad for you, but it's definitely possible that they're affecting your cognitive abilities. Have you considered trying to mix up your gaming habits and do some other activities that challenge your brain in different ways? For example, you could try reading a book or doing a puzzle, or even trying a new hobby. This might help keep your brain sharp and prevent it from getting too used to the same old stimuli."
5. "I think it's also worth noting that IQ scores are not necessarily a measure of real-world intelligence. There are many different types of intelligence, and IQ scores only measure one specific type. It's possible that you're still very intelligent in other ways, even if you don't feel like you're as sharp as you used to be. Have you considered exploring other areas of your life where you might be using your intelligence, such as in your relationships or in your career?"

TITLE: Getting a new job where I need to incorporate (S Corp) and am lost when it comes to taxes and salaries (and dividends, oh my!)

POST: Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm going to be starting a new job soon at 130k a year, with a rather special circumstance. As part of the terms of me being hired, I need to set up a S Corp, and essentially be business to business in terms of the relationship with the company.

I know it sounds super sketchy for a company to require me to do that, but it makes sense in context. I am 20 years old, and HR would never green light 130k for a 20 year old dude, so this is the solution that was proposed.

I understand that I take on more taxes because of me being self employed (the other half of the taxes normally paid by the employer), but I am lost as to how to count anything. I should be paying myself a salary, and then paying the rest through dividends correct? Are there any sort of step by step guides on how to do this correctly?

Also, is there a way (short of sitting down with a CPA) to calculate my take home pay when counting dividends and federal/state/local taxes? I looked online at tax calculators, and they either seem too simple, or vary wildly. Some say that I would owe 10k total per year (seems too low) and some say that I would owe 50k total per year (seems wayyy to high).

Furthermore (sorry for the wall of text), I'd like to setup some sort of retirement account (or accounts), but since I will be self employed I'm not sure what avenue to take.

I have contacted a CPA in the area to setup an appointment to get incorporated, but was looking for some advice from more voices on the questions above. Thanks!

TL;DR: Starting a new job at 130k a year, required to set up a S Corp. Lost on how to count taxes (salary and dividends), and how to calculate take home pay. Also looking for advice on setting up retirement accounts as a self employed individual.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Congrats on the new job! I'm not a tax expert, but I can try to help. As a S Corp, you'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary (around 50-60k) and then take the rest as dividends. You'll need to keep track of your business expenses and deduct them from your income to reduce your taxable income. For taxes, you'll need to file a personal tax return (1040) and a business tax return (1120S). You can use tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block to help with the calculations. As for retirement accounts, you can consider a SEP-IRA or a Solo 401(k). I'd recommend consulting with a CPA to get a better understanding of your specific situation.

TITLE: I[19F] believe I am bi-sexual, should I come out? Identified to bf[20M], and I don't know how to proceed. [x-post from /r/sex]

POST: Well. I will start off by saying that I told my SO that I thought I was bi-sexual today, and he seemed to treat it as water off a duck's back. I was thoroughly surprised since he is a little jealous sometimes when it comes to other men, but I guess he could just call it "hot" if he really isn't taking me seriously.

Anyways, that's not the point, I was always a little curious, but never acted upon the fantasies I had. I always would think of women giving me oral, or I always thought that breasts were so nice, and kind of got turned on by them.

Here is where things get a little complicated. I do believe I am bi-sexual, but never got the chance to act on it. Once when I was in high school me and one of my closest friends got drunkenly dared to kiss each other, and we did. What would she think if I came out as bi? And my best friend is gay, we never did anything, but would this complicate the relationship? I'm pretty scared to tell people- should I?

Also, some parts of my family aren't that accepting of non-heterosexual relationships, so if I came out, should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

How would I go about it?

I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I think I'm bi-sexual, told my SO, he seemed okay with it, but I'm still unsure about coming out. I'm scared of how my friends and family will react, especially my best friend who is gay. Should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're considering coming out! It's a big step, but it can be really liberating. I think you should start by talking to your best friend who is gay. They might be a good resource for you and can help you navigate the situation. Also, it's okay if not everyone is accepting of your sexuality. You don't have to come out to everyone, just the people you feel comfortable with. And remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to rush into anything."
2. **u/queer_and_proud**: "OP, I'm so proud of you for considering coming out! It takes a lot of courage to be honest with yourself and others. I think you should definitely talk to your best friend who is gay, they might be able to offer some valuable advice and support. Also, don't worry too much about what your family thinks, they might surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Just be true to yourself and don't apologize for who you are."
3. **u/straight_up**: "Hey OP, I'm not bi-sexual, but I do have a lot of respect for people who are. I think you should definitely talk to your best friend who is gay, they might be able to offer some good advice. Also, don't worry too much about what your family thinks, they might surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Just be true to yourself and don't apologize for who you are."
4. **u/anonymous_user**: "OP, I'm not bi-sexual either, but I do have a lot of respect for people who are. I think you should definitely talk to your best friend who is gay, they might be able to offer some good advice. Also, don't worry too much about what your family thinks, they might surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Just be true to yourself and don't apologize for who you are."

**Conclusion:**

The post received a lot of supportive comments from users who are either bi-sexual or have experience with coming out. The general consensus is that OP should talk to their best friend who is gay for advice and support, and not worry too much about what their family thinks. The comments also emphasized the importance of being true to oneself and not apologizing for who you are. Overall, the post received a lot of positive feedback and support from the community.

TITLE: When should I [M24] offer to start paying for things at my girlfriends [F26] place? Or at all?

POST: We've been together officially for a little over a month now, but have been dating for closer to four months. I've known her almost three years now.

Since things became official I've been spending nearly all my time at her place. She gave me a key and has said that it's half my home too. So my dog and I are there now all the time. I still have my own apartment (six months left on the lease). We've talked some about me moving in, which will happen officially once my lease is up. But if I'm spending all my time at her place, using heat, water, electricity, etc... Shouldn't I help pay for something? Or is it too soon to talk about that kind of thing?

Her internet is very slow DSL and she's off contract.. I've thought about offering to have my much faster cable internet moved to her place and just keep paying it myself.. Thoughts?

TL;DR: Girlfriend's place is my new home, but I still have my own apartment lease. Should I start paying for things at her place, like utilities? Or is it too soon to discuss?

COMMENTS:

* "It's not too soon to discuss, but it's also not necessary to start paying for everything right away. You could offer to help with specific expenses, like internet or utilities, and see how she feels about it. It's also important to remember that you're still technically a guest in her home, so it's not like you're entitled to start paying for everything just because you're spending a lot of time there."
* "I think it's a good idea to offer to help with specific expenses, like internet or utilities, but also make it clear that you're not expecting anything in return. You could say something like 'Hey, I've been noticing that your internet is pretty slow, and I have a much faster connection at my place. Would it be okay if I helped pay for it and just kept it at my place?' That way, you're showing that you're willing to help out, but also respecting her boundaries."
* "I think it's a bit premature to start paying for everything at her place, especially since you're still technically a guest. You could offer to help with specific expenses, like groceries or takeout, but it's not necessary to start paying for utilities or rent just yet. You could also consider having a conversation with her about your long-term plans and see if you're on the same page."
* "I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with your girlfriend about your financial situation and see if you're on the same page. You could say something like 'Hey, I've been noticing that I'm spending a lot of time at your place, and I want to make sure we're on the same page about finances. Are you comfortable with me helping out with specific expenses, or do you want to keep things separate?' That way, you're showing that you're willing to be open and honest about your finances, and you're also respecting her boundaries."

Overall, the comments suggest that it's not too soon to discuss financial responsibilities, but it's also important to consider your girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Offering to help with specific expenses, like internet or utilities, can be a good way to show that you're willing to contribute, while also respecting her autonomy. It's also important to have an open and honest conversation about your financial situation and long-term plans to ensure that you're on the same page.

TITLE: Would you consider it unhealthy to hate people?

POST: It's not like I'm talking about going around and murdering random people, but I don't have very many nice things to say about them.

I think they are pieces of trash that are led by personal and selfish desires and if deemed necessary Would not hesitate to kill a motherfucker. So maybe I sort of lied about the murdering thing, but I really don't believe that people are worth keeping around. We sit around and manipulate each other until we get what we want. I see most people as mindless animals that are just taking up space and fucking each other so that they can produce more mindless garbage. It just sickens me to see and hear what people do to others.

I mean sure there are the people who actually go out of their way to make a difference and try their best to be good people but I feel like those people are so few and far apart. I believe that all people have the potential to be amazing, but I also believe that people have the potential to be horrible monsters, and I think that most people go in the bad direction.

I don't know, maybe I am just some dumb high-schooler (17 years old in case you were wondering) who is too stupid to see that people aren't shitty. Maybe you people can show me the way. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to not hate people?

TL;DR: I hate people and think they're all selfish and manipulative. I don't think they're worth keeping around and I think most people are just taking up space and producing more garbage. I'm 17 and I don't know if I'm just stupid or if people are actually that bad.

---

**Response 1:**

Hey OP, I'm glad you're willing to question your feelings and seek advice. It's normal to feel frustrated and disillusioned with the world, especially during your teenage years. However, I want to gently challenge your perspective. While it's true that some people can be selfish and manipulative, it's not accurate to generalize that all people are like that.

I think it's important to recognize that people are complex and multifaceted, and that we all have the capacity for both good and bad. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of humanity, I encourage you to look for the good in people and the world around you. There are many amazing people out there who are working to make a positive difference, and I'm sure you'll find them if you look hard enough.

As for your suggestion that people are just taking up space and producing more garbage, I want to respectfully disagree. Every person has the potential to make a positive impact, and it's up to each of us to choose how we want to use our time and energy.

I'm not saying it's easy to change your perspective, but I encourage you to try. Take some time to reflect on your feelings and experiences, and see if you can find any glimmers of hope or positivity. You might be surprised at how much good you can find in the world.

**Response 2:**

OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - your post is pretty toxic. While it's understandable to feel frustrated with the world, your language and attitude are not constructive or helpful. Instead of focusing on how much you hate people, I encourage you to think about how you can make a positive difference in the world.

I'm not saying it's easy to change your perspective, but I am saying that it's possible. Instead of looking for reasons to hate people, try looking for reasons to love and appreciate them. You might be surprised at how much good you can find in the world.

I'm not going to give you a bunch of empty platitudes or tell you to "just be positive." I'm going to tell you that it's okay to feel angry and frustrated, but it's not okay to let those feelings consume you. You have the power to choose how you react to the world, and I encourage you to use that power to make a positive difference.

**Response 3:**

OP, I'm not going to lie, your post made me uncomfortable. But I'm also not going to dismiss your feelings or tell you that you're wrong. Instead, I want to offer you a different perspective.

I think it's possible that your feelings of hatred and frustration are a result of your own experiences and traumas. Maybe you've been hurt or betrayed by people in the past, and that's led you to feel this way. Or maybe you're just feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from the world around you.

Whatever the reason, I want to encourage you to seek help. Talk to a therapist or counselor, or reach out to a trusted friend or family member. You don't have to go through this alone.

And while I understand that it's hard to see the good in people when you're feeling this way, I want to remind you that everyone has the potential to change and grow. Maybe there are people out there who are worth getting to know, and maybe you can find ways to connect with them and build positive relationships.

I'm not saying it's easy, but I am saying that it's possible. And I'm here to support you on your journey. **End of responses**.

TITLE: My (16F) boyfriend (16M) hasn't gotten me a gift yet... our anniversary was a little over two weeks ago.

POST: I don't know whether my being upset is valid or not, and I'd like some insight.

Our 2 year anniversary was July 20th and I got him a cologne, a little bag of the candies he likes, and a new CD, along with a few more personal items. He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.

It sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me. This has happened at least 3 times already. Honestly I've lost excitement in going because I feel like it's never going to happen.

I can't bring it up to him because whenever I do he gets really upset and apologizes a lot, which I appreciate, but I just would rather him say that he can't take me (if that's the case) rather than continue to drag this out.

I feel bad for being upset, because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck. But it doesn't change the fact that he's been promising and not coming through, which is upsetting. 

I need an outsider's opinion so I can have some unbiased opinions to look through.

TL;DR: My 16 year old boyfriend hasn't gotten me a gift for our 2 year anniversary, despite promising to take me to Sephora and buying me $30 worth of products. He keeps saying he'll have the money, but something always comes up and he can't take me. I'm upset and don't know if I'm being unreasonable.

RESPONSES:

* OP, you're not being unreasonable at all. It's understandable that you're upset, especially since he's been promising and not following through. It's not about the gift itself, but about the lack of effort and communication. You deserve better than to be strung along like this.
* I think you're being really understanding and patient. It's not fair that he's not following through on his promises. Maybe you could have a calm conversation with him about how you're feeling and see if you can come up with a solution together?
* OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You're 16, and your boyfriend is also 16. You're both still learning and growing. It's okay to make mistakes and have miscommunications. Maybe you could try to have a conversation with him about how you're feeling, but also try to be understanding and not too critical?
* I think you're being really reasonable. You deserve to feel special and celebrated on your anniversary, and it's not okay for him to keep promising and not following through. Maybe you could try to set some boundaries and communicate your feelings more clearly with him?
* OP, I think you're being way too focused on the gift itself. It's not about the gift, it's about the thought and effort that goes into it. Maybe you could try to have a conversation with him about what you're looking for in a gift, and see if you can come up with something that works for both of you?

Overall, the responses are supportive and understanding, with some suggestions for how the OP can communicate her feelings to her boyfriend and work towards a solution. The comments also acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and have miscommunications, especially at a young age. However, they also emphasize the importance of communication and setting boundaries in relationships.

TITLE: My fitness pal help needed.

POST: I have just started a journey to a new an healthier me as I realised that turning 25 being 236lbs at 5'9" was not a good way to end a year. 
I have been cooking healthier meals and working out almost daily for 25-35 mins of cardio, and I recently started using fitbit and MFP together. 
I am as honest as I can be without kitchen scales (which I am buying this weekend) about the weight of all the foods and therefore the calories that I am eating but I find that MFP is nagging at me to eat more. 
Today I have cooked a HUUUGE meal for lunchtime that I think would serve about three people. Lots of fresh veg, a bit of skinless chicken and some quiona, when I put the amount of food into MFP it tells me the calories are too low and I am putting my body into starvation mode, I am not sure I will be able to eat even half of this meal, but I am worried that if I don't eat more my body won't be able to repair itself.
On an average day I will eat about 1200 calories, consisting of porridge & honey for breakfast, lunch of a meat, veg and quinoa/couscous and dinner of fresh veg, meat and sometimes potatoes. 
I don't often find myself hungry and I drink about 2-3l of water a day, if I have less I get a massive headache from the central heating system. So I was wondering if anyone else finds MFP nagging at them to eat more calories. Even on the meals that I cheat with and have a pizza MFP is still telling me I am under my calorie limit although those days are the only days it doesn't nag me about starvation mode.

TL;DR: I'm using MFP and it's telling me I'm not eating enough calories, but I'm not hungry and I'm worried about overeating. Has anyone else experienced this?

---

This post is a great example of how the r/loseit community can provide helpful advice and support. The OP (original poster) is struggling with MFP's calorie recommendations and is worried about overeating or not eating enough. The community responds with a mix of advice and personal experiences.

Some users suggest that MFP's calorie recommendations may be based on general guidelines and may not take into account individual factors such as metabolism, activity level, and body composition. Others recommend using MFP as a guide, but not as a strict rule, and to listen to one's body and eat when hungry, stopping when satisfied.

One user shares their own experience of using MFP and notes that it can be helpful to track progress and stay accountable, but it's also important to focus on overall health and well-being rather than just calorie intake. Another user suggests that the OP may be eating enough calories, but not getting enough protein, which can affect hunger and satiety.

The OP responds to the comments, thanking the community for their advice and sharing their own thoughts and experiences. They decide to continue using MFP as a guide, but also to listen to their body and eat when hungry, stopping when satisfied. They also decide to focus on overall health and well-being, rather than just calorie intake.

Overall, this post and the subsequent comments demonstrate the supportive and helpful nature of the r/loseit community, and how it can provide valuable advice and guidance for individuals on their fitness and health journeys.

TITLE: Me [24F] with men - Can't trust them

POST: My relationships haven't worked out lately and I have realized that I have never NOT been cheated on by someone. I struggle with depression, have been to therapy, and know I am not always easy to be around but I know I don't deserve this. 

I am having an increasingly difficult time forming healthy relationships because I just don't trust men with my heart and in turn, I can't let my guard down and really let a relationship develop. My self-esteem is pretty wrecked, too. I am really unsure what to do because like everyone, I want connection and love. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: NSV, I now take a bike and the stairs to work.

POST: As far as my weight goes, the short story is that I somehow got to be over 260 pounds at 5'9"-ish, and then lost about 80 pounds. That was a few years ago. I was in damn good shape. Could run, was thinking about joining the armed forces. Everything was awesome...

A few years later, and I fell off. I turn 24 next week, and I was recently juuuuust over 300 pounds. I live almost exactly 100 miles north of New York City. Last semester IU started commuting to the city for work and school. I still live up north, because I have another job up there. Train tickets got expensive, so I saved money by biking instead of taking the subway.

I only just started eating healthier a couple weeks ago, but I'm down about 10-15 pounds right now. Just hit 286, and I'm very happy. I know it isn't really progress, but it's nice to know that it's all improvement from here. I've done it before, and I can do it again. I know I won't let myself fall off.

So the first few times I took a bike a few miles from Grand Central Terminal to my job, only a few miles, I was so tired the next day. Mostly just my legs (Coat + Backpack didnt help >.<). Anyway, it has been getting easier, and I think now that it's warm I'll take up some weekend leisure rides. :)

Also, about 20 minutes ago, I took the elevator down to street level to go buy some food, and realized I forgot my wallet, which means I forgot my elevator key. I could have asked the door man, but instead just took the stairs 21 floors up. I was almost out of breath at the top, and I'm sure I will get muscle cramps tomorrow, but it was so worth it. :)

TL;DR: NSV, I'm down 10-15 pounds in a couple weeks, and I'm getting back into shape. I've started biking to work and taking the stairs instead of the elevator. It's tough, but it's worth it.

TITLE: I'm going there: I cannot bring myself to finish LOTR.

POST: **Notice: I mean no disrespect to fans so please don't take this the wrong way.**

...but I'm more than open to having my mind changed if someone can explain to me what I'm missing.

My job has an hour-long commute, so I joined the library and have been going through podcasts and audiobooks like crazy. 

While sifting through their audiobook collection I saw they had all of the LOTR books, which I've never read -- I wanted to as a teenager but never got around to it. I never watched the movies because I wanted to read the books first because I'm a nerd like that. I knew absolutely nothing about the series other than the brief introduction I had to it while playing the Interplay LOTR adventure game on PC in the mid-90's for half an hour once.

So for the first few discs I found it a little monotonous. Lots of awkward singing by the narrator, lots of painfully long descriptions of the Shire and lots of genealogy for minor characters, which I found odd. But I assumed it'd pick up since I had 14 discs left to go.

I'm currently on disc 9 (right as they're getting to Rivendell) but I absolutely cannot get interested in it, though not for lack of trying. Each commute it gets more difficult for me to keep listening rather than just throw on music or the news. Every time I get to a new disc I feel like I just finished several hours of homework and I have to bargain with myself to start the next one. 

It's not that I don't like it. I like Tolkien's style, the characters are ridiculously well-developed and I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was in the 1950's...I just can't figure out what's so interesting and exciting about it to so many people, and I certainly can't imagine spending 50+ more hours finishing out the entire trilogy. 

Can someone change my mind before I bail and take it back to the library on Tuesday? 

If it matters in your analysis, my normal taste is Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and non-fiction about science, politics and religion. My favorite book is Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett.

TL;DR: I'm having trouble getting into LOTR on audiobook and I'm wondering if someone can explain what I'm missing. Help me understand why I should keep going!

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you're missing the point of LOTR. It's not about action or plot twists, it's about the journey, the characters, and the world-building. Tolkien spent years crafting this world and its inhabitants, and it shows."
* "I agree with you, the beginning can be slow. But once you get to the Fellowship, it picks up. And the characters! Oh man, the characters are amazing. You'll grow to love them."
* "I think you're being too harsh. The singing is just a small part of the book, and the descriptions of the Shire are beautiful. It's a world you can get lost in."
* "I'm a huge fan of Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut, and I can see why you might find LOTR slow. But trust me, it's worth it. The themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the struggle between good and evil are timeless."
* "I think you should try listening to it in a different format. Maybe try the movie or a graphic novel adaptation. Sometimes a different medium can make all the difference."
* "I'm a big fan of David Sedaris, and I can see why you might find LOTR dry. But humor is subjective, and I think you might find that the book has a dry wit that you'll appreciate once you get further in."
* "I think you're missing the historical context. LOTR was written during a time of war and uncertainty, and it reflects that. The themes of hope, perseverance, and the power of ordinary people are incredibly powerful."
* "I think you should give it another chance. Try listening to it during a different time of day, or with a different mindset. Sometimes our brains just need a little nudge to get into a story."
* "I think you're being too critical. It's okay if it's not your cup of tea. There are plenty of other books out there that you'll love. Don't feel obligated to finish it just because you started it."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful responses! I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who's struggled with getting into LOTR. I think I was expecting something more fast-paced and action-packed, but it's clear that the book is more about the journey and the characters.

I think I'll give it another chance, and try to approach it with a different mindset. Maybe I'll try listening to it during my morning commute instead of my evening commute, or try to focus more on the characters and their relationships instead of the plot.

Thanks again for your comments, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the rest of the trilogy!

TITLE: Me [22F] with my Boyfriend [22M] 4 years, he wants to move in together and I'm not ready.

POST: So like the title says, we've been together 4 years, since we were 18 and all through our college years. Now that we've both graduated and are landing steady jobs we are looking to move out. He thinks it would make the most sense to move in together and has also mentioned getting engaged but not getting married for a while. I don't want to get engaged or married until my late 20s (that's always been my plan). I also side with my traditional mom and grandma who do not think moving in together is okay until we are at least planning a wedding. 

I can totally see myself marrying him if we are still together in several years. But I can also see things coming between us. I'm dead set on living in another country, and I might actually have to spend six months in another country within the next couple of years. He has always mentioned that he wants to stay in the town we live in now. I am also very chronically sick (nothing terminal, but sometimes debilitating) and he doesn't handle that very well when I'm going through a flare. 

I definitely love him with my whole heart and everyone thinks we're perfect together, but I'm still hesitant. How do I tell him I don't want to move in together and get engaged yet without hurting his feelings and making him think I don't love him?

TL;DR: 4-year relationship, boyfriend wants to move in together and get engaged, I'm not ready. I love him, but I'm hesitant due to my chronic illness, potential future plans to move abroad, and my desire to wait until my late 20s to get married. How do I tell him without hurting his feelings?

TITLE: I [M/18] think my stepmother [F/44] is overstepping her boundaries

POST: For the past couple of years my father [M/52] has been married to my stepmother [F/44] and I [M/18] think she is overstepping boundaries and is taking advantage of my father in many situations.

Now, first of all, she isn't some horrible step mother, but she isn't great either. She doesn't have any kids of her own so she tries to punish me as if I was her kid, which my father allows. This would honestly not be a big deal, if she seemed sane...

She nitpicks at everything I do one week, and then loves me the next. The littlest thing can trigger her, such as what happened tonight.

I ran out of batteries in my remote, so I replaced them with the batteries in my dad's remote, which were in his bedroom. I do this a lot, and then hide the used batteries somewhere obvious so he puts them in and then the remote still doesn't work.

Nothing happened for a while, so I assumed they just replaced the batteries, so I fell asleep. I was awakened to screaming and yelling and slamming of the opening of my door. My stepmother was yelling about how 'going into their room was an invasion of privacy'... I would understand that if the door was locked... Or closed... Or not wide open... Or if I was never allowed to go in there before... But, no. It had never been an issue before. She now told me that she doesn't trust me, and doesn't think she will be able to sleep in the same house as me...

She walked out, still yelling and shouting, and I told my father that I think it is essentially bullshit what she is doing, but all he does is nod and agree with her and say 'I need to stay on the same page as her. That's what a marriage is.'

TL;DR: My stepmother is overstepping boundaries and treating me like a child, and my father is enabling her behavior.

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit, where individuals seek advice and support on navigating complex relationships, particularly those involving family members. In this case, the OP (original poster) is frustrated with his stepmother's behavior and feels that his father is not taking his side.

The post also raises important questions about boundaries and power dynamics in relationships. The OP feels that his stepmother is overstepping her boundaries and treating him like a child, while his father is enabling her behavior by not taking his side. This can be a difficult and sensitive topic, and the OP is seeking advice and support from the community.

Overall, this post is a good example of the types of relationships-related issues that are discussed on the r/relationships subreddit, and the community's responses to these issues can provide valuable insights and advice for individuals navigating complex relationships.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my ex[20 F] did I handle this correctly?

POST: So we broke up about 2 weeks ago after 4 months or so of dating because she said she wasn't feeling the way she did before to which I said fine but I would remove her from everything (not blocked or anything) we used as communication because I did not want to deal with the one sided feelings in order to get over it, she said for me to do whatever I need.

Thing is the past few days I've just been wondering was this the right thing to do? It was my first real relationship so I don't know if I come off like an asshole by doing what I did as i'd like to be friends with her later when feelings are not involved.

TL;DR: Broke up with my ex 2 weeks ago, removed her from all communication channels, now wondering if I handled it correctly and if I can be friends with her later.

COMMENT 1:
Dude, you did what you needed to do to move on. It's not selfish to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. If you want to be friends with her later, that's great, but don't feel obligated to do so just because you're trying to be "cool". You did what was best for you, and that's all that matters.

COMMENT 2:
I think you did the right thing by giving her space and not trying to cling to the relationship. It's normal to feel confused and unsure about what to do after a breakup, but it sounds like you made a conscious decision to prioritize your own healing. If you do want to be friends with her later, that's awesome, but don't feel pressured to do so if it's not what you truly want.

COMMENT 3:
Honestly, I think you handled it pretty poorly. Removing her from all communication channels without even talking to her about it or giving her a heads up? That's pretty cold. If you want to be friends with her later, you're going to have to make amends and have a real conversation about what happened. Otherwise, you're just going to be stuck in this limbo where you're both just pretending to be okay with the situation.

COMMENT 4:
I think you did the right thing by setting boundaries and prioritizing your own feelings. It's not always easy to do what's best for yourself, especially in a situation like this. If you do want to be friends with her later, that's great, but don't feel guilty or obligated to do so. You did what you needed to do to move on, and that's all that matters.

This subreddit post and comments provide insight into how people perceive and respond to a situation where someone breaks up with their partner and then removes them from all communication channels without discussing it with them. The comments range from understanding and supportive to critical and judgmental. Some commenters believe that the OP did what was best for themselves and should be allowed to move on without guilt or obligation to maintain a relationship with their ex. Others think that the OP handled the situation poorly and should make amends and have a real conversation with their ex if they want to be friends later. This highlights the complexities and nuances of relationships and the importance of communication and empathy in navigating breakups.

TITLE: TIFU by assuming the toilets in my building were "fits it ships" toilets

POST: This happened a few months ago...

I'm a grad student, so I work most weekends. This is important later. Over the summer, I had made it a habit of going poo in the second floor bathroom. It's a single toilet and the best in the building. Knowing I could easily clog my home toilet during my healthy eating binge and having heard from my male friends of the industrial flushing power of the campus toilets, I decided to make using this toilet my routine.

Until the fuck up. This one particular poo did not fit nor ship, thus rendering the toilet useless. It was a Friday afternoon, and the cleaning crew doesn't come in on the weekends. And Monday was a holiday. Ugh. Oh well, I thought. I still had the men's room. Weekends weren't busy, so I wasn't concerned.

Saturday comes around and I use the men's bathroom as a backup. It didn't fit nor ship on Saturday, either. After that, I had to walk to the opposite side of the building and down a floor to use the bathroom until Thursday because they had to call a professional plumber...

TL;DR: I clogged the toilet in my building's second-floor bathroom by assuming it was a "fits it ships" toilet, and it took four days to get it unclogged.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author assumed that the toilet in their building was a "fits it ships" toilet, meaning it could handle any amount of waste, but unfortunately, their poo did not fit nor ship, causing a clog.

The post is well-written, with a clear and concise narrative that sets the scene and explains the situation. The use of humor and self-deprecation makes the story entertaining and engaging, and the author's willingness to share their mistake and the consequences that followed makes the story relatable and endearing.

The post also includes some interesting details, such as the fact that the cleaning crew doesn't come in on weekends and the author's decision to use the men's room as a backup, which adds to the story's humor and charm.

Overall, this post is a great example of a "TIFU" story, and it's likely to resonate with readers who have had similar experiences or can relate to the author's mistake.

TITLE: After finishing Week 3 Day 3 of C25K I am noticing an unintended benefit of my new lifestyle....(x-post from r/C25K)

POST: Every day of this week, I have pushed myself to increase my pace while doing the workout. I am running on a treadmill since I already have a gym membership so I can measure exactly how much faster I am going. I went from day 1 at 6.5 miles per hour to Day 2 at 6.7mph and then today all my run intervals were at 7mph. Even though each workout is the same, I found that this keeps it challenging instead of resorting back to the idea that its something I've already achieved.

So here's the unintended part: I have noticed that with my continued success in losing weight, dieting properly, and keeping to my exercise goals that my confidence in myself is going up. I know that is to be expected but its also effecting my ability to be better in other areas of my life that I never could stick with like my hygiene, my schedule, my budget, keeping in touch with people, etc etc. It's like seeing that when I am determined to do something I can achieve is pushing me to reassess those other things and know that I can improve them too. I get more enjoyment out of striving to be an all around better adult and improving myself now so I have seen much more improvement in all aspects of my life. It's a great feeling as there things have been nagging me for years.

TL;DR: I'm on Week 3 Day 3 of C25K and I've noticed that my increased confidence from losing weight and sticking to my exercise routine is spilling over into other areas of my life, such as my hygiene, schedule, budget, and relationships. I'm enjoying the feeling of being a more well-rounded and improved adult.

TITLE: [23/f] I think my [22/f] friend needs therapy, but I'm not sure if it's my place to tell her.

POST: We will call her Rita. Rita and I have been friends for almost 5 years. During the beginning of our friendship she had told me that she was recovering from depression but it had gotten a lot better. Throughout our friendship there are a few things I have noticed about her. 

1.	She is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.

2.	 I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)
In regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.

He just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)

3.	I found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.

I haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself. Well last night she called me to see if I wanted to get some coffee with her. I agreed but I'm not sure If it's my place to bring up that I think she needs professional help, or if recommending it would be a good idea.

TL;DR: I think my friend Rita needs therapy, but I'm unsure if it's my place to tell her.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not your place to tell her she needs therapy. You're not a professional, and it's not your responsibility to fix her problems. If you're concerned about her well-being, you could try having a gentle conversation with her about how you've noticed she's been struggling and offer to support her in any way you can. But ultimately, it's up to her to decide if she wants to seek help."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're being too focused on Rita's problems and not enough on your own feelings. Have you considered that maybe you're just not a good match for her right now? It's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. If you're not feeling fulfilled or happy in the friendship, it might be time to re-evaluate."
3. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: "I'm glad you're concerned about Rita's well-being! It's not your place to tell her she needs therapy, but you could try having a conversation with her about how you've noticed she's been struggling and offer to support her in any way you can. You could also suggest that she talk to a therapist or counselor, but make it clear that it's her decision. Remember, it's not your responsibility to fix her problems, but you can be a supportive friend."
4. **u/unsolicitedadvice**: "I think you should tell her she needs therapy. I mean, you're her friend, right? It's your job to look out for her and help her. Just be gentle and caring about it, and I'm sure she'll appreciate your concern. Plus, who knows, maybe she'll even thank you for it!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all for your input! I think I will try to have a gentle conversation with Rita about my concerns and offer to support her in any way I can. I don't want to come across as judgmental or pushy, but I do want to be a supportive friend. I'll make sure to prioritize my own feelings and boundaries as well, and re-evaluate the friendship if necessary. Thanks again for your advice!"

TITLE: Charge-off, Paid in full on my credit report; can I get this removed?

POST: Hi all,

Just under a year ago, I moved states, and brought my credit union account to zero with the intention of closing it. However, before I was able to follow through, Paypal used the bank account to withdraw funds from Christmas shopping. This was maddening because it was my secondary account and not my primary. Anyway, I didn't discover this for months, since my credit union allowed my account to remain overdrafted to the tune of $450, and I wasn't checking that balance anymore. So now it's listed on my credit report and I'm trying to buy a new car, so it would come in very handy if it were removed. Please help!

TL;DR: Charge-off on credit report due to overdraft, paid in full, but still listed. Can I get it removed?

---

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm no expert, but I think you might be in luck. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires creditors to remove paid-in-full accounts from your credit report. Since you've paid the $450, you should be able to dispute the charge-off with the credit reporting agency and get it removed. Make sure to include a copy of your payment receipt and a clear explanation of the situation. Good luck!"
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I agree with throwaway123456. You should definitely dispute the charge-off with the credit reporting agency. Additionally, you might want to consider sending a goodwill deletion request to the credit union. They might be willing to remove the charge-off from your report if you explain the situation and show that you've made an effort to resolve the issue. Just be sure to keep a polite and professional tone in your request."
3. **u/credit_karma**: "I'd recommend sending a dispute letter to the credit reporting agency, as well as a goodwill deletion request to the credit union. Also, make sure to keep a record of all correspondence and payments, as you never know when you might need to prove that the account was paid in full. Good luck, and I hope you're able to get the charge-off removed!"
4. **u/financialwizard**: "I'd like to add that you should also check your credit report to make sure there are no other errors or inaccuracies. It's not uncommon for credit reports to have mistakes, and you want to make sure you're not missing out on any other opportunities to improve your credit score. Once you've disputed the charge-off and removed any other errors, you can start working on rebuilding your credit. Good luck with your car purchase!"



This post is an example of a common scenario where a person is trying to remove a paid-in-full charge-off from their credit report. The original poster (OP) is seeking advice on how to dispute the charge-off and get it removed. The replies from the community offer guidance on how to dispute the charge-off with the credit reporting agency and also suggest sending a goodwill deletion request to the credit union. The community also emphasizes the importance of keeping records of all correspondence and payments, as well as checking the credit report for any other errors or inaccuracies. Overall, the post and replies demonstrate the importance of being proactive in managing one's credit and seeking help when needed.

TITLE: TIFU by starting an oil fire in my kitchen

POST: This fuck up happened a couple years ago before I knew of reddit and now I feel compelled to share it. 

So it was new years eve and my husband and I didn't have much food in the house. So I decided to make some homemade potato chips to munch on while we watched a movie. I used a pot and heated up some oil. The chips turned out okay I can never seem to cut them thin enough. I turned off the stove and returned to the couch to watch our movie. 

So the kitchen in my apartment was hiding behind a corner, so there was no way we could have noticed the flames any sooner. 

I see a ominous orange glow coming from the kitchen so I casually walk over and turn the corner and...
OH SHIT! FIRE! FIRE!

I literally panic like an idiot. And thank goodness my husband was there to take care of the situation otherwise I would have surely burnt down the apartment. Turns out I hadn't turned off the burner, but had left it on the highest setting.

So my husband bolts into the kitchen and grabs the  pot of oil that has ignited. With some quick thinking he grabs a nearby pan and attempts to smother the flames whilst running out of the kitchen towards the door. I open the door and finally in the breezeway of the apartment complex my husband tames the fire.

There was black soot coated on the vent hood of the stove and my pan was destroyed. I am just glad I didn't start the new year by burning down the apartment.

TL;DR: I started an oil fire in my kitchen while making homemade potato chips and my husband saved the day by smothering the flames with a pan.

TITLE: What can i do about an abusive owner?(I work in a restaurant with illegal employees)

POST: Like any other restaurant there is a lot of crazy shit that goes on semi-regularly. The owner is an italian immigrant, who has little respect for his employees. Last year he got arrested for beating up one of our 17 yo bussers. He will pretty much do anything he can get away with. All of our kitchen and now bussers are illegal immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador. These dudes are the hardest working chillest bros out there. Favorite people in the restaurant by far. I've even learned semi-fluent spanish from them. My biggest deterrent to reporting my boss for an array of abusive actions, is my concern all my buddies will get deported or something. The servers tip out the bussers every night yet the bussers never see this money. When i confronted the manager she informed me it was used to pay their hourly wage. Our carry-out guy gets tips from time to time directly from the customer. I learned today that he has to give those tips to the owner and the credit card tips are just ignored by him. They tried to tell me the same thing when i covered for the carry out guy this morning. I confronted them then, and was told i could talk about it later when the carry out guy wasn't around. I dont know what to do. Can i report the management or owner with out my foreign buddies getting in trouble.

TL;DR: I work at a restaurant with an abusive owner who has a history of violence. The staff is mostly illegal immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador. I'm worried that if I report the owner, my friends will get deported. The owner takes tips meant for the staff and doesn't pay them a fair wage. What can I do?

TITLE: Living with Negativity....26M

POST: Alright so here is the quick and dirty
Me - 26 M
Her - 32 F
Married 2 years this July.
Together 5 years this October.

When we first moved in together I had alot of things that I had to work on as far as being a better husband and communicating with her better, doing my part around the house etc.  Each time it was brought up it devolved into fighting but we figured that this wasn't working so devised a solution, a list!

This worked, my behaviours changed for the betterment of the relationship and myself and I feel like a better person for it.

Now me, I am a generally positive individual, I try my best to maintain a relatively positive outlook on things and just be humorous.  When it comes to serious stuff I am serious but otherwise I love to smile!

The issue I am having now is that we have been having ongoing discussions for the past 6 or so months about her attitude which has been getting progressively worse.  She is employed, currently paying down her student loans and stuck with a job that she hates while she does so.  Understandably not the best situation but I am always here for her and to support her, I've helped her get her food blog started, helped her get the implements for her baking etc.  

Instead of a happier more positive wife I have someone who constantly looks at the negatives, refuses to discuss our future together because it is depressing and just in general has issues showing emotion.

We have discussed this time and again, I'm getting sick of it, she is too and I'm just not seeing much improvement.

I love her, I care for her but for my own mental health I am having difficulty wanting to actually spend time with her when it feels like she just hates life.

Kind of a can't see the forest through the trees kind of thing.

I'm open to any suggestions Reddit may have on this.

TL;DR: Married 2 years, wife's negativity is getting worse, refusing to discuss future, constant complaining, and it's affecting my mental health. I love her but I'm at a loss on how to deal with this.

---

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and stuck. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with your wife about how her negativity is affecting you? Sometimes people don't realize the impact their behavior is having on others."
* "I'm not a relationship expert, but it sounds like your wife might be struggling with depression or anxiety. Have you considered seeking couples therapy to help you both work through this together?"
* "I'm a big believer in the power of gratitude. Have you tried having a daily or weekly gratitude practice together? It might help shift her focus away from the negatives and towards the positives."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your own mental health needs and wanting to prioritize them. Have you considered taking some time for yourself, doing things that bring you joy and relaxation, and then coming back to the relationship with a clearer head?"
* "I think it's important to remember that you can't fix your wife's negativity, but you can control how you respond to it. Have you tried setting boundaries around what you're willing to engage with and what you're not? For example, you could say 'I'm not going to engage in a conversation about this right now, let's focus on something more positive.'"
* "I think it's great that you're trying to be supportive and help your wife with her goals, but it sounds like she might be taking advantage of that. Have you considered setting some boundaries around what you're willing to do to support her, and what you're not? For example, you could say 'I'm happy to help you with your food blog, but I'm not going to do it for free. Let's discuss a fair compensation for my time and expertise.'"

**Themes:**

* The importance of communication and open discussion in relationships
* The impact of negativity on mental health
* The need for boundaries and self-care in relationships
* The importance of seeking outside help and support when needed
* The power of gratitude and positivity in relationships

**Subreddit-specific insights:**

* The r/relationships community is known for its supportive and non-judgmental atmosphere, which is reflected in the comments on this post.
* The community emphasizes the importance of communication, empathy, and understanding in relationships.
* The post highlights the challenges of dealing with negativity and depression in a partner, and the need for self-care and boundaries in these situations.

TITLE: Our kitty is so picky, we've given in.

POST: Our rescue cat, Abby, has always been picky with food. When we first got her, she was quite ill and didn't like to eat anyway so that was even more difficult. Every time we think she likes a food, she stops eating it within a week and won't eat it again (Only after we have bought a months supply...).  

The thing is, we've tried to out-stubborn the cat, and it was a game of chicken we were never going to win.  And then came kitty number two, Ollie, who is just the jabba the hutt of kitties.

Not only will Ollie eat any left over food in Abby's bowl, but Abby doesn't want it and actively gives it to her baby sister.  It got so bad that Abby was vomiting clear bile out of hunger at night... we tried separating them, getting new foods, giving dry food to snack on... it was no use, she didn't eat. Before anyone asks, she HAS been to the vet and they just said she's picky.

Fast forward to us getting a gift pack from our vet for the baby when we took Abby in to see if there is a problem. It has royal canin weaning kitty food, and we thought we'd see if Ollie liked it. Guess who likes it? Abby. It is kitty crack cocaine I don't know. We started sprinkling it on top of normal cat food, and guess what.. she eats it. It's like a seasoning.

So here is our doubt, is this ok to do? The vet seemed really passive about it, and I don't know how good this is to do. I looked up its ingredients and it almost seems just like a vitamin packed dry food. We are sprinkling so she doesn't eat more than a a few grams.

TL;DR: Our rescue cat, Abby, is super picky and we've tried everything to get her to eat. We got a gift pack from our vet with royal canin weaning kitty food and it's like kitty crack cocaine for her. We're sprinkling it on top of her normal food and she eats it. Is this ok to do?

COMMENTS:

* "I'm not a vet, but it seems like a good solution to me. As long as you're not overdoing it and making sure she's getting a balanced diet, I think it's fine. It's not like you're replacing her regular food with the royal canin, just supplementing it. And if it's helping her eat, that's a win in my book!"
* "I'm a vet and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for cats to be picky eaters. As long as you're not overdoing it and making sure she's getting a balanced diet, I think it's fine. The royal canin weaning kitty food is a good option because it's designed for kittens, but it's also suitable for adult cats. Just make sure you're not giving her too much of it and that she's still eating her regular food."
* "I'm not a vet, but I think it's great that you're finding a solution that works for Abby. It's not uncommon for cats to be picky eaters, and it's great that you're willing to try different things to help her. Just make sure you're not overdoing it and making sure she's getting a balanced diet. And if you're concerned about the ingredients, you can always talk to your vet about it."
* "I'm a vet and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for cats to be picky eaters. As long as you're not overdoing it and making sure she's getting a balanced diet, I think it's fine.

Overall, the comments are supportive and encouraging, with many people sharing their own experiences with picky eating cats. The vets who commented provided reassurance that as long as the cat is getting a balanced diet and not overdoing it on the royal canin, it's a good solution. The OP is relieved to have found a solution that works for Abby and is grateful for the support and advice from the community.

TITLE: Had a great date with a guy [26M] that I [23F] met online, and then out of the blue he goes completely no contact two days later. Do I reach out for closure?

POST: I have been texting and snapchatting a guy I met on OKCupid for 2 weeks before we decided to meet and go on our first date. 

When we met, we clicked. Our sense of humor aligned, we both have the same views on religion and politics, and never ran out of things to talk about over the course of the day. (We went hiking and picnicking, so we were together for about 7 hours on a Saturday.) At the end of the night, there was a perfect first kiss, then some making out later, and talks of a "next time."

We texted back and forth a little on Sunday, and then Monday I get radio silence. He finally texts me back these one word answers, and then eventually just stops responding. I check on Facebook to see if there's anything going on (as he's a fairly active user and uses Facebook a little like Twitter) only to find out I've been unfriended. 

That was two days ago, and I'm afraid I've been a mess ever since (I know it's silly to get attached that quickly, but we had in depth conversations over the course of two weeks and I've always worn my heart on my sleeve anyway.) I know it's over, I just have no idea why. He gave me no indication that anything was wrong, and if going on that date with me was just acting then he deserves an Oscar. 

Do I reach out to him again for closure? I don't want to be the clingy girl that can't take a hint, but I'm kind of heartbroken that I don't at least know WHY.

TL;DR: Met a guy online, had a great date, and then he went no contact two days later with no explanation. Should I reach out for closure or just move on?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, I think you should just move on. You've already given him a chance to respond and he's chosen not to. It's clear he's not interested in pursuing anything further. Don't waste your time trying to get closure from someone who doesn't care about you."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "I agree with the above comment. You've already been ghosted, and it's not worth your emotional energy to try to get closure from someone who's clearly not interested. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to have a conversation with you."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think it's worth reaching out to him once more, just to get some closure. But make it a brief and non-accusatory message. Something like 'Hey, I was really enjoying getting to know you and I'm confused about why you stopped responding. If you're not interested, that's okay, but I'd appreciate some kind of explanation.' If he doesn't respond again, then it's clear he's not interested and you can move on."
4. **u/heartbroken_in_seattle**: "I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've been in a similar situation before and it's really tough. I think you should reach out to him, but be prepared for the possibility that he won't respond again. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to have a conversation with you. Remember that you're worthy of love and respect, and don't settle for anything less."

There are plenty of other fish in the sea, and you'll find someone who's worth your time and energy."

TITLE: My [37M] ex-wife [36F] started dating someone that doesn't want her seeing me. To respect his wishes, she has cut off contact and I can't see my stepson [15M] that I've known for nine years.

POST: My ex-wife and I have known each other for nine years. For those nine years I have also had the wonderful opportunity of building a father/son relationship with my stepson.  My son's mother was/is the best friend I've ever had. Sometimes relationships have their issues so we divorced. We have stayed friends and have been able to be a part of their lives. 

Around the end of June and beginning of July she started to date someone seriously.  All I wanted for her was to be happy, which she was. At the end of July she told me she needed to speak with me. We met for lunch and the first words out of her mouth were, "You're going to hate me." At that point she told me her new boyfriend didn't want her seeing me, but that it was her choice. She then told me I wouldn't be able to see my son, who I would see at least once a week to hang out, work on homework, or use the season tickets we had to one of the local sports teams.  Afterwards, she told me she would re-evaluate the situation in four months and that I would be able to see my stepson one more time to speak with him (under the supervision of his aunt). After the meeting she blocked me on all social media and had my son do the same.

I was devastated because I had lost two of my best friends. 
The last 16 weeks have been some of the most difficult I've ever faced. I contacted my son's aunt and she told me her sister hadn't told her anything about the agreement of seeing my son and that she didn't want to get involved. I'm fine with that, I don't want to cause any rifts with her family. 

This Monday will be the end of four months. I have some ideas on how I should approach the situation but I would like anyone's opinion on how to proceed.

TL;DR: My ex-wife started dating someone who doesn't want her seeing me, so she cut off contact and I can't see my stepson anymore. It's been 16 weeks and I'm looking for advice on how to proceed when the four-month mark is up.

TITLE: My [22f] girlfriend pays her little sisters 100$ phone bill every month when we can barely pay our own bills. She refuses to bring it up to her parents.

POST: I'm 22m and my girlfriend 22f have an apartment together. We have a rent, phone bills etc. Both of us work full time to pay our bills. The problem is my girlfriend has been paying her little sisters bill as well as her own and we never have any extra money. We can't go to a dinner or movie at the end of the month because we have bills and food. Her parents are not the best off but they make at least 5 times as much as we do. They have pot (which I have no problem with ) and do other recreational activities. Her little sister is 13. 

I understand a cellphone is necessary with buses and stuff but why is my gf fronting the bill. She refused to bring it up to either of them and I've talked to other people in her family and their on my side.  I keep telling her to please bring it up to them. I didn't mind before we had all these bills but now that we're trying to start a life every penny counts.  I don't want to bring it up to her parents because I'm not exactly in the position too but this is effecting our bills. Not to mention I want her to be on my significantly cheaper service provider. 

Her mom also does little things like say she's coming over then shows up her, her boyfriend, his son and his sons friend. We have a tiny one bedroom and this ruined my night because I couldn't even sit on my couch and relax after work. She's also told her little sister Her and her friends could stay at our house while they attended a con which we could not house or feed. (They didn't enzd up staying but it's the principal) My girlfriends sister is family but I don't think it's her/our responsibility to care for her. The main issue though is the phone bill. What should I do guys?

TL;DR: My girlfriend pays her 13-year-old sister's phone bill every month, which is affecting our own finances. She refuses to bring it up to her parents. I'm worried about our financial stability and want her to talk to them about it. What should I do?

**Comments:**

* "Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. It's not about being mean or controlling, it's about being responsible and making sure you're both on the same page financially."
* "I think it's great that your girlfriend is helping her sister out, but it's not sustainable for her to be paying her sister's phone bill every month. Maybe she can talk to her parents about it and see if they can help out or if there's a more affordable option for her sister."

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my Roommate [24 M] 5 months, We agreed to a certain amount for rent. I ask for rent early and he says "i'm not an atm". Need some advice.

POST: A little bit of back story. I am in a situation where I do not have to pay rent or utilities for my house.

 I decided to let my friend move in with me as long as he pays 150 dollars a month to me for rent. Today I just asked him if I could get the money early because I need gas and to get some other stuff. He basically told me that I use him as an atm. I don't understand this. We agree'd to a certain amount. I told him that I hope he didn't see it that way, because I don't see him that way at all. He has lended me 15 bucks for a leash for my dog a while back and I told him he could take it off of rent, but that's the only time I have asked for any sort of early rent from him or any sort of money beyond the agree'd 150. What's the deal and what can I say? I'm kind of upset about it and it felt like an accusation of sorts.

TL;DR: Roommate says I'm using him as an ATM when I ask for rent early. We agreed on 150/month. I've only asked for early rent once before and that was for a specific reason.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* **Some people:** "You're being unreasonable. You agreed to a certain amount, and you should stick to it."
* **Some people:** "Your roommate has a point. You're essentially asking him to be your personal bank. You should be more considerate of his financial situation."
* **Some people:** "It's not about the money, it's about the principle. You're not respecting the agreement you made with your roommate."
* **Some people:** "Maybe you should have a conversation with your roommate about your financial situation and see if you can come to a compromise."
* **Some people:** "You should just pay your rent on time and stop asking for early payment. It's not worth the drama."

**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* The situation is complex and has multiple perspectives.
* The roommate's concern is not just about the money, but also about the principle of respecting the agreement.
* The OP should consider having a conversation with his roommate to clear up any misunderstandings and find a compromise.
* The OP should also think about his own financial situation and whether he can afford to pay his rent on time.

**ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:**

* How do you think the OP should approach the conversation with his roommate?
* What are some potential compromises that the OP and his roommate could come to?
* How can the OP avoid similar situations in the future?

TITLE: Get paid in cash/silver+gold bullion, not sure how to file taxes.

POST: So I'll be filing my won taxes for the first time, and I'm a little confused because of the way I make money. I work online and get paid with either btc or paypal. When I get paid with bitcoin, I sell in on localbitcoins for either cash or gold/silver bullion. I've had some issues with paypal before, and because of this I don't add all my personal/banking info. Each week I use the money on paypal to purchase around $3500 of gold/silver bullion from ebay. All of which I keep in a safe. I have money in my checking/savings account that I use for bills/expenses, so all the money I have made this year is in gold/silver. I know this seems really silly or might be a stupid thing to do with my money, but collecting gold and silver is a hobby of mine and I've just been stocking up. 
I started keeping detailed track of the exact dollar amount I was making about 4 months ago, but earlier than that I was stupid and didn't write anything down so I don't know the exact amount of money I made. 
Is there something I should do if I don't know how much I have made, and don't have a W2 or any tax info? Do I mark down that I'm self employed?
I know this seems really confusing, so I understand if your advice is just "hire a tax professional"

TL;DR: I make money online, get paid in bitcoin/paypal, sell bitcoin for cash/gold/silver, and keep all my money in gold/silver. I don't know how to file taxes because I don't have a W2 or any tax info. Help?

**RESPONSES:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm not a tax expert, but I think you should consult one. It sounds like you have a unique situation and you don't want to risk getting audited or fined. You might want to start by keeping track of your expenses, like the cost of buying and storing your gold and silver. You should also keep records of your income, even if it's just an estimate. It's better to have some documentation than none at all. Good luck!"
2. **u/taxpro123**: "OP, I'm a tax professional and I can help you with this. It sounds like you're self-employed, so you'll need to file a Schedule C and report your income and expenses. You'll need to estimate your income based on your records, and then you can deduct your expenses, like the cost of buying and storing your gold and silver. You might also want to consider consulting with a tax professional to make sure you're doing everything correctly. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to taxes."
3. **u/investor123**: "OP, I'm an investor and I think you're making a smart move by diversifying your portfolio with gold and silver. It's a good idea to have some physical assets outside of the stock market. However, I do think you should consult with a tax professional to make sure you're doing everything correctly. You might also want to consider consulting with a financial advisor to make sure you're making the most of your investments. Good luck!"
4. **u/financialfreedom**: "OP, I'm a financial freedom enthusiast and I think you're on the right track by diversifying your portfolio with gold and silver. However, I do think you should be careful about the tax implications of your investments. You might want to consider consulting with a tax professional to make sure you're doing everything correctly. You should also make sure you're taking advantage of all the tax deductions and credits available to you. Good luck!"
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I just wanted to add that you should also keep track of your gold and silver purchases, including the date, price, and quantity. This will help you keep track of your expenses and make it easier to report them on your taxes. You should also consider getting a safe deposit box at a bank to store your gold and silver. This will help you keep it secure and make it easier to access if you need to. Good luck!"


**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* Consult with a tax professional to ensure accurate and compliant tax filing.
* Keep detailed records of income, expenses, and gold/silver purchases.
* Consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize investments.
* Take advantage of tax deductions and credits available.
* Keep gold and silver purchases organized, including date, price, and quantity.
* Consider storing gold and silver in a safe deposit box at a bank.

TITLE: I am a fucking dumbass who can't read numbers

POST: I mixed up two of the digits when I sent the text message.

I am in a student organization that helps build primary and secondary schools in rural areas in Honduras. I went on a week long service trip last winter and it was the most amazing week of my life. I can't describe why, but being in this organization and working towards my fundraising goal has been just about the most important and fulfilling thing in my life over the last year or so.

I was supposed to head back to Honduras in 5 days. For now I am home from college over winter break. I noticed last week that I made the colossal mistake of leaving my passport at my college apartment (~5 hrs away). Thankfully, I had a roommate still there who could mail it to me. With over 10 business days before leaving on my trip at the time, I figured mailing it was not much of a risk (I realize now how stupid this reasoning is).

Of course, today, I checked back over my text conversation with my roommate and noticed I got the fucking address wrong. 2 numbers swapped places. I don't know if I read it wrong or typed it in wrong. The address I sent does not exist. I am a fucking aerospace engineering student but I can't fucking read a fucking 5 digit number apparently. 

I am lost for options at this point. It will be near impossible to track it down (it's in an envelope, no tracking #). It will most certainly be returned to my college apartment too late to get in time for my flight.

I realize that this only happened because of a special series of idiotic errors that only I am capable of. I have wasted a years worth of fundraising, over a thousand dollars worth. I spent so many mornings at bake sales and sponsored events. I worked so hard and now I will spend the week at home feeling sorry for myself. I want to crawl under a rock and die.

TL;DR: I'm an aerospace engineering student who can't read numbers and lost my passport in the mail because I swapped two digits in the address. I'm a huge failure and I feel like I've wasted a year of my life.

TITLE: How do I [21F] break up with my BF [21M] of two years? First relationship.

POST: It's over. 

It hurts to admit it, but it's true. We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. 

There's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). 

It's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. 

What do I say? I don't want to hurt him. I've been putting this off because I don't want to have to go through the stress of one of us moving out or explaining to his parents (who treat me like a daughter). How do I even bring it up? I have never done this before and I don't know how. 

Also- my biggest fear- will I regret it? 

Thank you for any advice or comforting words.

TL;DR: 21F, 2-year relationship with 21M, feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, and controlled. Want to break up, but scared of hurting him and regretting it. Need advice on how to approach the conversation and what to expect.

TITLE: I (24) have found out my bf's (25) mother abandoned their family. How do I be supportive?

POST: I am in a new relationship (4 months) and discovered through my boyfriend's friend that his mother abandoned their family when he was very young. One of his friends let this slip to me after a few drinks at a party. My boyfriend has not told me yet.

Previously I knew there has been no contact with his mom and the subject is very touchy. I haven't pushed him to reveal anything. We had spoken about our pasts before, he was upset but said in time he will be able to tell me things and I am ok waiting for him to share. 

He's also been hurt in former relationships and I think this has really affected him being open with me as he avoids in-depth or emotional conversations.

I come from a family where my parents are still together and have no idea how to approach this or help him feel more at ease with me. I care about him very much and want to make this work. Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR: I found out my boyfriend's mom abandoned him when he was young. He hasn't told me and I'm unsure how to approach this or be supportive.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's amazing that you're willing to be supportive. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about what you've learned. Let him know that you care about him and want to support him, but also that you need him to be honest with you about his feelings and experiences. It's okay if he's not ready to talk about it right away, but by having the conversation, you're showing him that you're willing to listen and support him when he is ready."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're doing great by not pushing him to talk about it. Sometimes people need time and space to process their emotions. When you do have the conversation, try to focus on how you can support him and be there for him, rather than asking him to relive the past. You could say something like, 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about what I learned. I know this is a tough topic for you, but I want you to know that I'm here for you and I care about you. How can I support you through this?'"
3. **u/therapist**: "OP, it's great that you're thinking about how to approach this conversation. As a therapist, I would suggest that you focus on active listening and empathy. Let your boyfriend know that you're there to support him and that you care about him. Avoid giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix the situation. Instead, focus on understanding his feelings and experiences. You could say something like, 'I can imagine how difficult this must have been for you. Can you tell me more about what it was like?'"
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm a bit skeptical about your boyfriend's friend sharing this information with you. Did you ask your boyfriend about it? If not, you should have a conversation with him about it. It's possible that his friend didn't mean to hurt him, but it's still important to respect his boundaries and not share sensitive information without his permission."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Be open and honest with your boyfriend about what you've learned
* Focus on supporting him and being there for him, rather than asking him to relive the past
* Use active listening and empathy to understand his feelings and experiences
* Avoid giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix the situation
* Consider having a conversation with your boyfriend about what you've learned, and ask him how you can support him through this
* Be respectful of his boundaries and don't share sensitive information without his permission.

SUBREDDIT: r/Advice

TITLE: I need some advice about a few things

POST: The whole starting point of everything happened when my dad walked out on my mum after cheating. It's been an extremely messy and complicated divorce that is still not settled 4 years later. My dad has depression and has some perceived victim complex when talking about the divorce to people - to some he will lie and act as if they are still together (he didn't even tell his own family, they found out by trying to contact him through us). To others he says how my mum is the one who cheated - but HE is the one who cheated. He has also been keeping secrets and lying for many years before he left. He has lied constantly throughout the court process and won't agree to settle anything because he wants to destroy my mum - even the mediator says his behaviour is absolutely fucked and can't understand why he won't just settle things. That is only some of it - but I don't speak to him at all anymore. He hasn't supported me one bit throughout this entire process or even tried to.

A knock on effect is that now my mum and sibling have depression as well. All 3 of my immediate family have depression and I do not.  It is very difficult to live with her sometimes and I don't know what to do.

Due to all of this my mum is now trying to support me and the pets we have (sibling moved out of home)singlehandedly but money is extremely  tight all of the time. Due to me being over 18, my dad is not legally required to help me at all... It creates a lot of stress and I did have a job but lost it due to no hours for me. Now I have zero income. I am trying to get through uni - 4/5 days a week 1h30mins away, and do 5:30 starts most mornings leaving me somewhat sleep deprived. Moving is out of the question due to combined home circumstances, but the fuel cost is really difficult. I have only got the work experience of the job I just lost - 3 months weekend casual worker.

TL;DR: My dad cheated, left my mum, and is still causing drama 4 years later. My mum and sibling have depression, and I'm struggling to cope with the stress of it all. I'm trying to get through uni, but it's tough with no income and limited job experience.

Asking for advice on how to cope with the situation, how to deal with my mum's depression, and how to get back into the job market. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: Me [15 F] with my ex-bf [15 M] 2 months, having trouble letting go after getting dumped

POST: Basically I was dating another guy (John) for a year- not bad for a first relationship- but he broke up with me in a pretty harsh way (just dumped me out of the blue on the first day back to school. I was a wreck for months). Then my new ex (Mike) comes along, and kinda lifts me back out from my depression-esque mentality. So we're both attracted to each other, but I was scared to date Mike because I didn't think I could go through anotehr breakup. But after a while, I finally relented cuz I couldn't bear to see him with other people, and he kinda said, "If we break up, I'll make you hate me or something so it'll hurt less." Either way, we got together, but I was a bit clingy and needed a lot of his time, so he said he couldn't deal with it. Broke up with me gently, and said we could stay friends (we were pretty good friends in that period where he was helping me get over John). Now I want to be friends again, but I feel like I'm trying too hard. Also I still like him, and it's only been... about exactly a week. I've actually just started no contact for about 3 hours (shoulda done it right away I know, but it was hard), but I already feel like shit. 

Any advice? I need to let go and stop making a fool out of myself, especially because we have so many classes together. I can't keep my eyes off him and everyone says it's creepy. Help!

TL;DR: Got dumped by ex (John) after a year, then started dating new guy (Mike) who broke up with me gently after 2 months. I still have feelings for him and want to be friends, but I'm trying too hard and it's only been a week. Need advice on how to let go and stop making a fool of myself.

TITLE: I know my girlfriend [18/F] of 9 months cares, but she just doesn't put in any effort and I [20/M] am sick of it...worth breaking up over?

POST: Been seeing this girl since November, she is so much fun, absolutely gorgeous and very well-intentioned...but I think she's just fucking lazy. I'll ask her out and get turned down because her parents won't let her, she has work, she has uni or she's with other friends, to the point where I've stopped trying.

Part of the issue is me, because I'm too spiteful and refuse to be the one always asking. I asked two friends out to lunch today and just didn't bother asking my own girlfriend, simply because there was like an 80% chance she'd say no for whatever reason and I'd get pissed off.

I tried to break up with her a few months ago for the same reason, really, and I've had words with her about it since too. I know she cares, I know that I mean a lot to her and she doesn't want to lose me...but she just doesn't show it at all [when she's not with me]. When we're together everything is really good, great even. We have heaps of fun and clearly love each other's company. But once we part ways, it might be for the whole week despite us living like a 20 minute drive away, and 90% of the time we'll only see each other if I keep asking.

I've had this issue for a while but have told myself I'll wait until the end of August since by then we'll have had a few weeks with her parents out of the picture to see if the relationship actually changes, but I don't know if I can even hang in that much longer. I asked her to come over on Thursday since I hadn't seen her for a week and had been away - she was going to be at work that night and my place is closer than hers from there - but no, she was "too tired" to stay with me.

Since I've brought it up before and nothing's really changed, should I even go through the same speech again? I want to love this girl but I just spend so much of my time being pissed off.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 9 months is lazy and doesn't put in effort, I'm sick of it and don't know if it's worth breaking up over. I've tried talking to her about it before and nothing's changed.

---

This post is a classic example of a common relationship conundrum: the partner who doesn't put in effort. The OP (original poster) is frustrated because his girlfriend doesn't make an effort to spend time with him, despite knowing that he cares about her. He's tried talking to her about it before, but nothing has changed, and he's not sure if it's worth breaking up over.

The post is a good example of how relationships can be affected by differences in communication styles and expectations. The OP is frustrated because he feels like he's always the one initiating plans and making an effort, while his girlfriend doesn't seem to care about his feelings or make an effort to spend time with him. This can create a sense of resentment and frustration in the relationship.

The post also highlights the importance of communication in relationships. The OP has tried talking to his girlfriend about his feelings, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference. This suggests that there may be a deeper issue at play, such as a lack of emotional intelligence or a fear of conflict, that needs to be addressed in order to move forward.

Overall, this post is a good example of the kinds of relationship challenges that people face, and the importance of communication and empathy in overcoming them.

TITLE: I [27F] am upset with something the man I'm dating [30M] texted. Am I overreacting?

POST: I [27F] have been seeing a new guy, John [30M] for a month and a half. We see each other once a week, often on weekends, and text each other every day after work, usually telling the other one what our day has been like. He is the one initiating the conversation most of the time; not sure if it's relevant, but just saying in case it is. We didn't have the exclusivity talk yet.

Yesterday he initiated the conversation again and started telling me about this woman at work who wanted to set him him up with someone. I asked him if she showed him pictures of the woman in question. He replied: "Yes, she looks terrible. **I lied** and said I just started seeing someone."

I am very upset because of the "I lied" part of the sentence but didn't tell him anything about it yet. He didn't seem to be joking at all.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that our first date was outside and awesome and lasted six hours but that the dates after were mostly dinner at his place.

Do you believe he is seeing me as a fuck buddy and thinks I'm cool with it, or is there any chance that he is testing the waters to see how I am going to be reacting to his behavior?

TL;DR: Boyfriend lied about seeing someone else to get out of a blind date, didn't seem to be joking. I'm upset and unsure if he's seeing me as a fuck buddy or just testing the waters.

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're overreacting. He's just trying to get out of a blind date. It's not a big deal." (1 upvote)
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not a huge deal, but it's definitely not a great sign. You deserve better than someone who lies to get out of something." (2 upvotes)
* "I think you're right to be upset. Lying is a big deal, especially when it's about something as personal as dating. You should talk to him about it and see how he reacts." (5 upvotes)
* "I think you're giving him too much credit. He's probably just trying to get out of the blind date because he's not interested in her or the idea of dating someone new. Don't overthink it." (1 upvote)
* "I think you should take a step back and assess the situation. Are you really invested in this relationship? Are you getting the kind of attention and respect you deserve? If not, maybe it's time to reevaluate." (3 upvotes)

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: people seeking advice on whether they are overreacting to a situation or not. In this case, the OP is upset about the man she's dating lying to get out of a blind date, and is unsure if he is seeing her as a fuck buddy or just testing the waters. The comments range from telling her she's overreacting to advising her to talk to him about it and reevaluate the relationship. The post is a good example of how the subreddit can provide a platform for people to share their concerns and get advice from others who have been in similar situations.

TITLE: I (19F) just got stood up by the guy (19M) I've been seeing for 5 weeks.

POST: So I just got stood up. 

Here's the deal. I've been seeing this guy for about 5 weeks now and we've really been hitting it off. So far everything has been really good, no problems, and we planned last night to meet up for lunch during my 12-1 break today. We texted and had unrelated conversation this morning, then at 12 I left class to go meet him. 

By 12:15 he's a no-show, so I text to make sure everything is ok. 

By 12:30 I'm pretty pissed off, and a friend passes by so I accompany him to lunch and text the guy id been planning to meet that I had to leave to get food since I had class at 1.  He responds about 10 minutes later with something along the lines of "sorry, I'm awful, I got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time". I haven't said anything yet. 

I'm pretty angry, and those who know me in person know that I never get angry about anything. I don't know what to do. I really liked him and things had been going really well. If it wasn't for that I would have no trouble just not responding and never seeing him again, but I do really like him. What do I do/say?

TL;DR: Got stood up by guy I've been seeing for 5 weeks, he claims he got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time. I'm angry, but I really like him and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's not taking you seriously. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to show up on time. I would tell him how you feel and see how he responds. If he doesn't apologize and make it right, it's time to move on."
2. **relationshipadvice**: "I would say something like 'I understand that schoolwork can be overwhelming, but standing me up without a heads up is unacceptable. I feel disrespected and hurt. If you're going to prioritize schoolwork over our plans, maybe we're not compatible.' See how he responds and take it from there."
3. **skeptical_sarah**: "I'm with throwaway123456. If he can't even be bothered to show up on time, what does that say about his priorities? You deserve someone who respects your time and feelings. Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't value you."
4. **calm_down_kiddo**: "Take a deep breath and don't respond yet. Give him some time to realize what he's done and maybe he'll come crawling back. If not, then you know he's not the one for you. Remember, you're worth more than someone who can't even be bothered to show up on time."
5. **honest_abby**: "I would say something like 'I'm really hurt and disappointed that you stood me up. I thought we had a connection and that you valued our time together. If you're going to prioritize schoolwork over our plans, maybe we're not compatible. I deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to show up on time.' See how he responds and take it from there."

TITLE: TIFU by being weirdly obsessed with coin orientation

POST: I was about 10 and my friend and I saw a cool infomercial (no idea now what they were selling) where a guy flattened a penny with a hammer. (If you think you know where this is going, you are absolutely right.) For some reason, we thought it would be a great idea to try that, only we couldn't find a penny, so we decided to try to flatten a dime. Shockingly, dimes and pennies are made of different materials, so we weren't making much progress, but like good little elementary school kids, we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house. When it was my friend's turn, I noticed Roosevelt's face was angled about 40 degrees away from her, and for some reason it seemed really crucial that he be facing her dead on, so I rotated the dime. I was a neurotic, whiny kid, so when my mom heard me crying, she assumed it was something minor and came out rolling her eyes before she saw all the blood. Luckily, I didn't break any bones, but I had a cool hangnail with which to gross out all the boys on the bus for the next few weeks.

TL;DR: I TIFU by being weirdly obsessed with coin orientation and almost broke my hand trying to flatten a dime with a hammer.

TITLE: Dear reddit: Cute girl at the bank I want to ask out.

POST: The bank I go to has the cutest teller working inside during the afternoons, and I try to make up reasons to go just to see her. The problem is that when three tellers, or whatever, are working, no guarantee I'll get her window. I can't really just tell the person behind me, 'No no, you go ahead, I'm waiting for the cute one.' Anyway, We've talked a few times and flirted mildly. I was super-thrilled to see that she had a copy of an R.A Salvatore book - the fourth in the Drizzt series. So she's really pretty AND into geeky fantasy? I'm there!

So the question is, well two really, How to I find enough excuses to keep going back till I get her window? No guarantee she'll even be working that day anyway. And secondly, I feel kind of creepy hitting on a woman who's working. Like, she can't get away or whatever.

TL;DR: I want to ask out the cute bank teller, but I don't want to be creepy. How do I keep going back to the bank without being too obvious, and how do I ask her out without making her feel uncomfortable?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, just be honest with her. Tell her you like her and you'd like to ask her out. If she says no, then you know where you stand. If she says yes, then you've got a date. Don't overthink it."
* "I'd suggest striking up a conversation with her about the book. Ask her what she thought of it, if she's read the rest of the series, etc. That way you're showing interest in her tastes and not just trying to hit on her."
* "Just be yourself and don't try to be someone you're not. If you're genuinely interested in her, she'll appreciate your honesty. And if she's not interested, then you'll know and can move on."
* "I'd say try to find out her name first. It's always easier to ask someone out when you know their name. And maybe try to find out what her interests are outside of work, that way you can have something to talk about."
* "Don't be afraid to show your nerdy side. If she's into geeky fantasy, she might appreciate your enthusiasm. Just be respectful and don't be too over-the-top."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about not wanting to be creepy. That shows you're considerate of her feelings. Just be genuine and respectful, and I'm sure you'll do fine."
* "You could try asking her for book recommendations. That way you're showing interest in her tastes and not just trying to hit on her. And who knows, you might find a new favorite book!"
* "I think it's okay to be a little obvious. If you're interested in her, it's okay to show it. Just don't be too pushy or aggressive. A simple 'Hey, I really like talking to you, would you like to grab coffee sometime?' is a good way to ask her out."
* "Don't worry too much about being creepy. If she's not interested, she'll let you know. Just be respectful and don't take it personally. And if she is interested, then you've got a great chance of getting to know her better."

TITLE: Why aren't men interested in me? [f/20]

POST: Now, I don't really even know where to begin with this. I'm a 20 year old woman and I believe i'm a great person, but I just can figure out why men aren't interested in me unless they're just trying to hook up. I've had my fair share of hook ups, but never with someone i've just randomly met and i've continued to have good friendships with these men without having any desire to make a relationship out of it.

I am a full time student trying to get my degree, even doing that I have plenty of time to myself for other activities. I also am a mother. Sure I had my child young, but it's the one thing that changed my life for the better. I was not in school pre child and now my life has come together more than I ever could have hoped for. My child's father and I have a great friendship, and that's all it is. We co-parent very well together. Thus also leading me to have lots of time for myself as our time with our child is split 50/50.

I'd like to think that i'm a great person with a great personality. I enjoy pretty much anything and would be willing to experience new things. I've also always been told that i'm a very attractive woman. Now what am I missing here? I definitely don't need a man to make me happy, as I already am. I just know that i'd love to have that person who makes my life a little brighter.

Some of the men that i've been involved with recently (but not too recently) or interested in always seem to find a way out and I can't help but think it's either something to do with the fact that I already have a child or it's just something about me. I have my entire life in order. I live in my own home, no debt, I attend college and am very close to getting my degree. If  I can tell you one thing from that is that I have my life in FAR better order than most people my age and in my situation. Much better than most of my friends too.

So, any advice would help. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for, but it's something.

TL;DR: I'm a 20 year old woman with a child, I'm in school, and I have my life together. I'm attractive, have a great personality, and enjoy new experiences. I've had trouble finding men interested in me, and I'm not sure why. Any advice would be appreciated.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, having a child at 20 can be a major turn-off for some guys. It's not that they're not attracted to you, but they might be worried about the responsibility of being a step-parent or the potential for more children. You might want to consider being upfront about your situation with potential partners and see how they react."
2. **datingcoach**: "I think you're selling yourself short. You're a great person with a lot to offer, and it's not just about your physical appearance. However, it's possible that some guys might be intimidated by your independence and confidence. You might want to try to show a more vulnerable side to potential partners and see how they respond."
3. **singlemom**: "I'm a single mom too, and I can relate to what you're going through. I think it's great that you're focusing on your education and your child's well-being. However, it might be helpful to try to put yourself out there more and meet new people. Join a club or organization that aligns with your interests, or try online dating. You never know who you might meet!"
4. **skeptical_sam**: "I'm not trying to be harsh, but it's possible that some guys might be turned off by your age and the fact that you have a child. It's not uncommon for guys to prefer younger, childless women. You might want to consider focusing on building a connection with someone who is more mature and understanding of your situation."
5. **optimistic_om**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're a great person with a lot to offer, and it's not just about your physical appearance. You might want to try to focus on building a connection with someone who shares your values and interests. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know someone before jumping into a relationship."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* Having a child at 20 can be a major turn-off for some guys, and it's important to be upfront about your situation with potential partners.
* Confidence and independence can be attractive, but it's also important to show a more vulnerable side to potential partners.
* Putting yourself out there and meeting new people can be a great way to find someone who is interested in you.
* Focusing on building a connection with someone who shares your values and interests can be a more fulfilling way to find a relationship.
* It's okay to take things slow and get to know someone before jumping into a relationship.

TITLE: What's the best way to get over being jealous of GF's Gay best friend?

POST: 22M, Girlfriend is 21F. We've been together for a year and a half. Her best friend is gay. At first I was uncomfortable with him since I don't know that many gay people, but the more I hung out with him (only a few times) the more comfortable I've been with him. We have complete trust in each other. Girlfriend actually went out with him when they were in high school together, then he cheated on her and then that's when he came out of the closet. They've remained best friends and like to go to gay clubs together. I feel this problem would be less of an issue if I went with them, but I work really late 5 days a week, (til 3am on weekends).

My only problem with him is how much he likes to drink which I feel like has an influence on her. I've brought that up to her but she says she will only keep drinking when she wants to. When she would instagram pictures of them together hanging at the club or wherever it made me feel uneasy. I felt it was unhealthy to feel that way and getting addicted to seeing what she would post so I stopped going on instagram completely. 

The reason why I get jealous is because I feel like she has more fun when it's just him and her vs me and her since he makes her laugh so much. Does anyone have any advice for learning to accept the idea that it's okay that maybe she does have fun with him more, since he is her best friend and all.. 

Re-reading what I wrote here, makes me feel like this whole thing is silly, but I still would like to hear what others have to say. Thanks.

TL;DR: I'm 22M, been with GF for 1.5 years. Her gay best friend makes me uncomfortable due to his drinking habits and how much fun she has with him. I feel like I'm being irrational and would like advice on how to accept the situation.

---

TITLE: Fresh out of college and can't seem to land a programming job

POST: I graduated in Dec. 2010, and since then have been unable to get a programming job in my area.  Since my area is the state of Mississippi I decided to look elsewhere.  New Orleans is close by but all my attempts have given me nothing.  I have a friend in San Francisco and have started looking for work there, but so far nothing.  I haven't applied to many places in SF though because I'm unsure of the quality of many of the places.

I'm worried that no REAL work experience is hurting me.  Only experience I've got under my belt is fixing computers and setting up networks for local businesses.  I did that for money since high school.  I've placed in two competitions for innovative design for two projects at school -- one of which won first place ($3500).  Other than these things I don't really have much else.

If anyone has any pointers or knows of some places to submit a resume to I'm ALL EARS.  I'm currently working a minimum wage job helping out a friend, and am getting tired of looking like the town idiot who has a degree but no job.

TL;DR: Fresh out of college, no programming job, no experience, worried about lack of experience, looking for advice and job leads.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "Hey OP, I'm in a similar situation. I graduated with a CS degree and have been struggling to find a job. I've been applying to a lot of places, but it seems like no one wants to give me a chance. I've been thinking about moving to a bigger city, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision. Have you considered freelancing or taking on some part-time work to get some experience under your belt?"
2. **u/programmer123**: "OP, I feel your pain. I went through the same thing after I graduated. I ended up taking on some freelance work and building a portfolio of projects to show potential employers. It took a while, but eventually I landed a job at a decent company. Don't give up hope, keep applying and networking. Also, consider reaching out to people in your industry on LinkedIn and asking for advice or referrals."
3. **u/mississippi_mama**: "Y'all, I'm from Mississippi too! I know it can be tough to find a job, especially in a smaller state. But don't give up! I've seen some great companies come out of Mississippi, and I'm sure you'll find something soon. Have you considered reaching out to some of the bigger companies in the state, like NASA or the state government? They might have some opportunities available. And don't forget to network, attend some job fairs and industry events to meet people in your field."
4. **u/sfdev**: "Hey OP, I'm from SF and I've seen a lot of talented developers come through here. I think you should definitely consider moving to SF, it's a great place to start your career. There are a lot of startups and established companies that are always looking for new talent. I'd be happy to help you with your resume and cover letter, and maybe even introduce you to some people in the industry. Just let me know if you're interested."
5. **u/olddev**: "OP, I've been in the industry for a while, and I've seen a lot of changes.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband [40 M] of three years, weirded out by friendship with co-worker

POST: This is my second marriage, his first.  We have two kids.  For a couple of years, I've gotten a bad vibe from one of his female co-workers.  They are good friends, and get along really well.  They're both musicians.  He really likes her and wants to be able to hang out with her after work, like grabbing a beer with her.  I know he texts her sometimes outside of work hours but not sure how often or what about (he's pretty secretive with his phone).  It makes me super uncomfortable and he knows this. 

 We had a pretty big blowout a few months ago when she was throwing a party and I asked him not to go.  He thinks I'm totally irrational about her and gets angry whenever I try to talk to him about this.  He was going to go to the party regardless of how I felt about it so we ended up going together and it was fine.  

I have tried to just drop it since the party.  I feel like he knows how I feel and that's all I can really do.  He hasn't been going for drinks with her or anything, which I appreciate.   I have recently found out, though, that this woman has a reputation for being a "home wrecker."  My husband said it's because she went one a date with her married friend while he was separated from his wife.  This is making me feel even more uneasy about her and my husband's friendship.  I know rumor mills can get carried away, especially in a small town.  But I can't help but feel a little justified in wanting them to not be friends now that I know this.

More relevant information.... My first marriage ended because he met someone else.  So it's entirely possible I'm over reacting about this situation because of that.  I've been in therapy for over three years and feel like I've made great strides.  My husband occasionally goes to therapy with me but it hasn't been very helpful.  He gets impatient taking about the same thing over and over (his words).

TL;DR: Husband has a female co-worker friend who I'm uncomfortable with.  She has a reputation for being a "home wrecker."  I feel uneasy about their friendship and he gets angry when I try to talk to him about it.  I'm not sure what to do.

TITLE: I [20 M] have been dating a girl [19 F] for about two weeks; her crazy ex has been threatening the both of us.

POST: I met a girl on Tinder for a casual hookup. There ended up being good chemistry between the two of us and we transitioned into dating. We've had five dates so far and everything has been quite well except for her abusive ex of 8 months getting involved. She had broken up with him about 4 months ago and I was her first venture back into the dating scene. As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.

Shortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number. The two times we've spoken he told me in a very threatening manner that he happens to have friends in various biker gangs and doesn't appreciate me seeing her. He then gave me an ultimatum to either stop seeing her OR to not set foot into "his city". I've only talked to him for 30 minutes or so; but I've come to the conclusion that he isn't the most mentally stable individual.

I'm not a fan of getting involved in situations like this; I tend to avoid conflicts because my time and effort is better spent doing more productive things. And because of my lack of experience dealing with threats and unstable individuals, I'm reaching out to you /r/relationships. She has told me that he has never followed through with any of his threats over the past few months of being broken up, but I feel as if him seeing her with a significant other might be enough to give him initiative to actually do something.

So, what would my best course of action be? I really do like this girl, and have a date in the city planned with her on Sunday. But on the other side of things I'd rather not put myself in a situation where I may be at risk.

TL;DR: I'm dating a girl who has a crazy ex who's been threatening us both. He's been calling her phone, leaving threatening messages, and even spoke to me once, giving me an ultimatum to stop seeing her or not set foot in his city. I'm not sure what to do, and I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation.

**Top comments:**

* "OP, I think you should prioritize your own safety and well-being. If this guy is willing to threaten you and your girlfriend, he's not someone to be trifled with. Consider talking to your girlfriend about getting a restraining order or reporting his threats to the authorities. It's not worth risking your safety for a relationship."
* "I'm a woman who's been in a similar situation, and I can tell you that it's not worth it. The guy might not follow through with his threats, but the stress and anxiety of dealing with someone like that is not worth it. OP, I would advise you to reevaluate whether this relationship is worth the potential risks."
* "OP, have you considered talking to your girlfriend about how you're feeling? It's possible that she's not taking the threats as seriously as you are, or that she's not aware of the full extent of his behavior. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important in a situation like this. Maybe have a calm and rational conversation with her about your concerns and see how she responds."
* "OP, I think you should be careful not to overreact to this situation. It's possible that the guy is just trying to intimidate you and your girlfriend, and that he's not actually going to follow through with his threats. However, it's still important to take the situation seriously and to prioritize your own safety. Maybe consider talking to your girlfriend about getting a restraining order or reporting his threats to the authorities, just in case."
* "OP, I'm a lawyer, and I can tell you that it's definitely possible to get a restraining order against someone who's making threats. It's a legal process, but it can be very effective in protecting you and your girlfriend from harm. You should definitely consider talking to your girlfriend about this option, and to a lawyer if you're not sure how to proceed."

TITLE: I caught her with another guy by using the Find My iPhone website. Not sure if ill ever trust her again.

POST: 30 year old male here about to break up with the girl I saw myself marrying.
So I have had issues trusting my gf, we have been together for 2.5 years now. in march of 2010 I caught her coming home (we have lived in my place together for entire relationship) and she was out drinking with an ex boyfriend. I sucked it up and accepted her apology and have been dealing with it ever since. This is about the time I registered her phone with the Find My Iphone service.
Fast forward to Monday night- I get texts form her saying she was going out to pick us up some food. I come home from work late around 7pm and she is not home. she wont answer my calls or texts. I know where she is cause I pulled up Find My Iphone website and she is at the local bar down the street. I wait for 3 hours and finally get a text of her saying she was at her girlfriends house and she will be home soon. LIAR! I had enough and stormed off to confront her at the bar. Didn't see the car she was driving in the parking lot so I'm starting to think im wrong, But there it is parked IN THE BACK. as if to hide from me.
I found her and a guy she works with (restaurant, typical for sleeping with coworkers).
Now we are a mess and Im about to throw her out and start my life over, Sucks cause I wanted to marry this one.
She doesn't know I tracked her with the iPhone. And I don't think Ill ever trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex? In my eyes she lied to be with another guy while i was at work and that's cheating in my book.
Any advice is appreciated.
Also this is my first ever post to reddit and im using a throwaway account.

TL;DR: Caught my girlfriend with another guy at a bar using Find My iPhone. She lied to me about where she was and I'm about to break up with her. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're a genius for using Find My iPhone! I would've never thought of that. As for whether it's cheating, it's definitely a form of deception and dishonesty. You have every right to be upset and consider ending the relationship."
* "I'm not sure if I would've done the same thing, but I can understand why you're upset. It's not just about the physical act of cheating, it's about the trust and respect that's been broken. You deserve better than someone who would lie to you and deceive you like that."
* "I think you're being a bit harsh. She didn't have sex with the guy, so technically it's not cheating. But I get why you're upset. Maybe you should have a calm conversation with her about how you feel and see if you can work through this together."
* "I'm a woman and I've been in similar situations before. Trust me, it's not just about the physical act of cheating. It's about the emotional betrayal and the feeling of being disrespected. You're right to be upset and you deserve better than someone who would treat you like that."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so upset about this. Is it really about the cheating, or is it about feeling powerless and insecure in the relationship? Maybe you should take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want and need in a relationship before making any big decisions."

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thanks for all the comments, guys. I guess I was expecting a lot of 'you're a jerk for using Find My iPhone' kind of comments, but it seems like most of you are on my side. I do agree that it's not just about the physical act of cheating, it's about the trust and respect that's been broken. I'm still trying to process everything and figure out what I want to do. I think I'm going to take some time to think about it and maybe talk to a therapist or something. Thanks again for the advice and support."

TITLE: Finally got a date with a crush of 7 years, but it comes with a catch.

POST: So me of 21 finally got a confirmation that the girl(21), will allow me to take her on a "date".  That made me extremely happy was finally able to "grow the balls" and ask. Which in return she said yes. Things are going great so far as a long distance relationship.

There are two major problems though. The first is that I'm currently in Germany on a tour for another 4 months. So the next time I'll be able to see her and actually take her on the date will be when I come home for PCS leave(In the army). We talk every day Via Phone and Skype etc, which is nice even though I've known her for 7 years this is really the first time I have been able to see her personality for what it is, and it is amazing. She really is Liking the LDR, because she says the last couple of boy friends she has been with sex has been really involved and obscured what she has really wanted. She says she brags about me all the time about how I'm Sweet and charming and thing of the like. What are your problems, success stories to help motivate me in that way. 

The second thing is as much as I like her, she has HSV-1. With the amount of research I've done on this topic I'm skeptical about it. I am clean. I just don't know what to do. I like her...way to much for my own good, just to drop it off because of cold sores down below. As i mentioned above do you guys have any success stories, problems with a situation like this? I would really like some advice and other out looks then the obvious one of dude shes got the herp, just leave it, don't ever touch it.

TL;DR: Got a date with a crush of 7 years, but it comes with a catch. I'm in Germany for 4 more months, and she has HSV-1. I'm unsure what to do.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being a bit dramatic about the HSV-1. It's not a big deal, and it's not like it's a guarantee that you'll get it. Just use condoms and you'll be fine. The fact that you're even considering not seeing her because of this is ridiculous. You've known her for 7 years, and you're just now getting cold feet because of a little thing like HSV-1? Get over it and enjoy the date."
* "I understand your concerns, but it's not like she's going to infect you with HSV-1 just by being near you. It's a virus that's spread through skin-to-skin contact, and it's not airborne. Just be careful and use condoms, and you'll be fine. The fact that you're even considering not seeing her because of this is a bit sad.

TITLE: (22/M) Just recently out of a relationship with a (22/F), looking for a silver lining if it exists. Please help

POST: I dated a girl (22) for a year and a half. We split in summer because I moved to Florida for summer. She got a job in Panama city, right when I came home from Florida. 

I'll spare the details but she met up with a boy who she met after knowing on the Internet for 6 years. He lived 3.5 hours away from her. The day they met in real life he asked her out. She said yes. 

Fast forward 1 month... he moved in with her and they say I love you to eachother and I only found this out after creeping on her tumblr. Big mistake. But she'll text me every fucking week trying to be friendly I want nothing to do with her. But I still love her and haven't moved on. I was hoping she would eventually come back up to philly and we would work on things. Because I thought her behavior was extreme and just a front and irrational.

 How could a relationship with a stranger from the Internet work when he lives 3.5 hours away? Well after two or three weeks they live together and say I love you to eachother. Now I'm really depressed and feel like shit. Can anyone help, or try and explain what's going on?

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend met a guy online, moved in with him after a month, and says I love you. I'm still in love with her and feel like shit. Help me find a silver lining or something.

RESPONSES:

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like a really tough situation. I think it's normal to feel depressed and hurt after a breakup, especially when it's sudden and unexpected. But I want to try to help you find a silver lining. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to focus on yourself and your own healing. You don't have to be in a relationship to be happy and fulfilled. You can use this time to explore your own interests, hobbies, and passions. And who knows, you might discover new things about yourself that you never knew before. Just remember that you are worthy of love and happiness, regardless of whether you're in a relationship or not."
* "I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like a really tough breakup. I think it's normal to feel angry and hurt, but I want to try to help you see the bigger picture. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to learn and grow from the experience. You can use this time to reflect on what you want and need in a relationship, and what you're willing to compromise on. You can also use this time to focus on your own personal growth and development. Remember that you are strong and capable, and you can get through this. Just remember to be kind to yourself and take things one day at a time."

TITLE: [F29] Is there something in between casual sex and LTR?

POST: Three years ago I ended a 6 yr relationship, and it left me with a lot of trust issues. A few months after the split, my ex felt he needed to "clear the air" so that we could have a chance at reconciling. That involved my learning I had been completely oblivious to cheating, lying, and an arrest (yup, he went to jail for a few days and I had no idea). I know what you're thinking, that I am just super dumb. I wish that was the case, I'm college educated and have a professional career, just plain old gullible. In the aftermath, I have spent a year having exclusive relationships, the next having one night stands, and the last online dating. For the record online dating does nothing to improve trust issues, I had on guy tell me he slept with Cameron Diaz and another try to steal a set of golf clubs (and those are just the gems). 

This afternoon the guy I have been seeing on and off for the last six months finally agreed to keep things casual. Now, I am free to date and see whomever I choose, and am contemplating whether I want to go the online route again. My casual relationships thus far have involved ignoring lies because the details aren't important. This isn't one sided, I fib about where I am when I'm out with other guys. Unfortunately, when I notice them my history and fear makes ignoring feel self-deprecating, and I struggle to forgive myself for ages after the bad ones.  On the other hand, I am just not ready for the LTR I want, one missed text or phone call and I flip, but I'm not attracted to someone who caters to my every wish in the long term. So Reddit, I need suggestions on what to do next. 

- Side Note – During this last relationship I was in a place to tell my SO about how scared of lies I am and it got a lot better, so I know that in time it will get easier.

TL;DR: I'm a 29-year-old who has been struggling with trust issues after a toxic relationship. I've tried exclusive relationships, one night stands, and online dating, but nothing seems to work. I'm currently in a casual relationship, but I'm unsure if I want to continue or try something new. I'm looking for suggestions on how to move forward.

RESPONSES:

1. "Hey OP, I think you're looking for something in between casual sex and LTR. You're not ready for a full-on LTR, but you're not looking for just casual hookups either. You're looking for something with some level of commitment and intimacy, but with some freedom and flexibility too. Have you considered a 'friends with benefits' arrangement? It's not a full-on LTR, but it's more than just casual sex. You can still have intimacy and connection with someone, but without the pressure of a full-on relationship. Just a thought!"

2. "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough to know what to do. But I think you're selling yourself short by saying you're not ready for a LTR. You've already had a successful relationship in the past, and you've worked on your trust issues. You're capable of having a healthy, loving relationship. Maybe you just need to take things slow and focus on building trust with someone new. It's not about finding someone who caters to your every wish, it's about finding someone who respects and supports you. And who knows, maybe you'll find someone who is willing to work through your trust issues with you. Just a thought!"

3. "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not 'just plain old gullible', you're a victim of emotional manipulation. It's not your fault that you were cheated on and lied to. And it's not your fault that you're struggling to trust people again. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. As for what to do next, I think you should focus on building your self-esteem and self-worth. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and you can't do that if you're constantly beating yourself up over your past. Take things one day at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You got this, OP!"

4. "OP, I think you're looking for a way to avoid the vulnerability and intimacy that comes with a LTR. You're scared of getting hurt again, and you're using your trust issues as an excuse to stay in a casual relationship. But the truth is, you can't truly connect with someone on a deep level if you're not willing to be vulnerable and open with them. I'm not saying it's easy, but it's worth it. You deserve to have a real, meaningful connection with someone. So, take a deep breath and be willing to take a chance. You never know what might happen if you do."

5. "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're trying to find the perfect solution, but the truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. You're going to have to experiment and find what works for you. Maybe you'll find that a 'friends with benefits' arrangement is what you need, or maybe you'll find that you need something more. The important thing is that you're taking the time to figure out what you want and need. So, don't be too hard on yourself, and don't be afraid to try new things. You got this, OP!" 

These responses offer a range of perspectives and advice, from suggesting alternative relationship arrangements to encouraging OP to focus on building self-esteem and self-worth. Some responders acknowledge the challenges of navigating trust issues, while others urge OP to take a chance and be more vulnerable in their relationships. Overall, the responses provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for OP to explore their feelings and consider different paths forward.

TITLE: What alarming/unusual thing has happened to you to make you rethink certain travel destinations?

POST: A couple months ago I went to Miami with a female friend of mine. Little did I know I would encounter creeps everywhere - literally men waiting on the side of the road to approach us at night. On the second day there, we were walking to the parking lot to add more time for the space. It was about 6PM and there was a lot of foot/road traffic in the area. I can't remember if I was looking down at my phone or not, but my friend was walking a few feet ahead of me. Suddenly, a couple of guys pass me pretty close and I hear an aerosol spray and smell nothing but ether/paint thinner (no idea). Almost instantly I feel nauseous and have a strong head-to-toe light headed feeling, like I'm passing out. When I caught my breath I turned around and saw the two guys lingering by a parking meter watching me, then they walked away. My friend didn't see/hear anything happen, and I didn't tell anybody else walking around. I instantly felt freaked out and didn't feel right for the next hour. Needless to say, I left that night. I felt like I was in Taken 2 and there was no Liam Neeson to save my ass. I'll probably never go back to seedy Miami.

TL;DR: I got sprayed with ether/paint thinner by two guys in Miami and almost passed out. I'll never go back to that city.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, that's terrifying. I've had some weird experiences while traveling, but that's on a whole other level. I'm glad you got out of there safely."
* "I've heard Miami can be sketchy at night. Maybe stick to daytime activities and avoid walking alone at night?"
* "That's disgusting. I've had some bad experiences with guys in Miami too. I think it's a city that's really rough around the edges. I'll never go back."
* "I've had some weird experiences with ether/paint thinner before. It's not fun. I hope you're okay now."
* "I'm so sorry that happened to you. That's really scary. I'll make sure to be more aware of my surroundings when I'm traveling."
* "I've heard that Miami has a lot of problems with crime and violence. Maybe it's not the best place to visit."
* "I'm glad you got out of there safely. That's a really scary experience. I'll make sure to be more aware of my surroundings when I'm traveling."
* "I've had some weird experiences with guys in Miami too. I think it's a city that's really rough around the edges. I'll never go back."
* "I'm so sorry that happened to you. That's really scary. I hope you're okay now." (multiple comments)

This post is an example of a user sharing a personal experience that is alarming and unusual, which sparks a conversation about travel destinations and safety. The post is a warning to others about the potential dangers of visiting Miami, particularly at night. The comments are a mix of sympathy, concern, and advice, with some users sharing their own similar experiences. The post and comments highlight the importance of being aware of one's surroundings while traveling and the need for caution when visiting certain destinations.

TITLE: Why would anyone want to call themselves a gamer? (Rant)

POST: I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying "I'm a TV watcher" or "music listener." Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with "gamers."

"CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell." 

This hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because "that's what casuals play." The whole PC master race also irritates me. Who really gives a shit what someones console preference is?

I can't even finish my rant. It frustrates me that I ever called myself a gamer as a kid anyway. It's just so dumb.

TL;DR: I play games, but I don't call myself a gamer because I think the term has become too mainstream and is associated with a pretentious subculture.

COMMENTS:

* "I feel the same way. I play games, but I don't identify as a gamer. I just like playing games."
* "I used to be a hardcore gamer, but I stopped caring about the whole 'gamer' label. Now I just play games for fun."
* "I think you're being too harsh. Gaming is a hobby, and people should be able to identify as such without being judged."
* "I agree with you. The term 'gamer' has become too commercialized and is often associated with negative stereotypes."
* "I'm a gamer, and I don't care what you think. I play games because I enjoy them, and that's all that matters."
* "I think you're missing the point. Gaming is about community and shared experiences. The term 'gamer' is a way to connect with others who share similar interests."
* "I used to be a gamer, but I stopped playing games altogether. I realized that it was just a waste of time, and I had better things to do with my life."
* "I think you're being too critical. Gaming is just a hobby, and people should be able to enjoy it without being judged or criticized."
* "I agree with you. The term 'gamer' has become too mainstream and is often associated with negative stereotypes. I prefer to identify as a 'game enthusiast' instead."
* "I'm a gamer, and I don't care what you think. I play games because I enjoy them, and that's all that matters. If you don't like it, then don't play games."
* "I think you're missing the point. Gaming is about having fun and enjoying yourself. The term 'gamer' is just a label, and it doesn't define who you are as a person."


This post and its comments highlight the ongoing debate about what it means to be a "gamer" and whether the term is still relevant in today's gaming landscape. The original poster argues that the term has become too mainstream and is often associated with negative stereotypes, while others defend the term and argue that it is a way to connect with others who share similar interests. The comments also touch on the idea that gaming is a hobby and that people should be able to enjoy it without being judged or criticized. Overall, the post and its comments reflect the diversity of opinions and perspectives within the gaming community.

TITLE: Me [16M] am in love for the first time and it hurts.

POST: Hello, 

I'm a 16y/o male and im in love with a girl [16]. This is the first time i'm in love and it is really exchausting. I am 100% sure i am not ready for a relation yet and i don't want it either. I almost never talk with her so our relationship is non existing. Another thing is that someone else also likes her and it keeps getting in my head because they regularly chill with each other. I am at a point were i am so in love that i can't  focus on school anymore. I never had this feeling before and its a first time for me. The feeling i get is really exchausting. My heart rate goes up really high and i get a weird feeling in my stomach.

I started to like her about 5 months ago and i am really in love since 1 week ago. I don't know what to do and i don't think this will go away soon.

(Sorry for the really bad english grammar i'm not native.)

TL;DR: 16y/o male in love for the first time, feeling exhausted, unsure what to do.

TITLE: M25 needs help asking F23 out on a date. But it's more complicated than that.

POST: Hello! I'[M] 25 and single. I was wondering if you guys could please help me out with some advice on asking a girl out. I met this [F23], Elizabeth (pseudonym), last year at university while she and I were in a one year program together - we never met prior to this. We spent the better part of a year in close proximity, having mutual friends and hanging out. From the moment I saw her I was attracted - she was smart and pretty. Unfortunately, I could never get myself to ask her out. A part of me kept saying she's not interested because I never talked to her everyday, just whenever there was the occasional get together with mutual friends would there be some small talk. With the program over since last December 2014, I have never been able to get her off my mind. I have her on Facebook and I have her cell phone number, but I've never messaged her.

TITLE: Am I wrong in my convictions about jealousy?

POST: 24,M / 23,F

In two of my previous relationships, I was the jealous type and have greatly learned my lesson from being that way. I am currently in a 2 year relationship in which my girlfriend and I live together. I love her, but because of things I've experienced, I am no longer the jealous type. I won't let myself behave like that again. She gets upset with me because I don't get jealous. Don't get me wrong, if a guy were to touch her I'd knock him out. But she tells me that it makes her feel like I don't take pride in her or value her because I don't get jealous that another guy might think she's attractive or something. Am I downplaying jealousy too much? I don't feel that there is anything healthy about jealousy in a relationship, but it seems she does.

TL;DR: I'm not jealous, but my girlfriend is upset that I don't get jealous. She says it makes her feel unvalued and unappreciated. Am I wrong in my convictions about jealousy?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being reasonable. Jealousy is a toxic emotion that can destroy a relationship. It's great that you've learned from your past experiences and are not letting it control you. Your girlfriend might be feeling insecure because she's used to you being jealous, but that's not a healthy dynamic either. You should communicate with her about how you feel and why you don't get jealous. Maybe she's not used to feeling secure in the relationship and needs reassurance."
* "I agree with OP. Jealousy is a sign of insecurity and lack of trust. If you're not feeling it, it's probably because you trust your girlfriend and feel secure in the relationship. That's a great thing! You should be proud of yourself for overcoming your past issues and not letting jealousy control you. Maybe your girlfriend needs to work on her own insecurities and trust issues instead of expecting you to be jealous."
* "I think you're being a bit too dismissive of your girlfriend's feelings. Just because you don't get jealous doesn't mean you don't value or appreciate her. Maybe she's feeling insecure because she's not used to being with someone who doesn't get jealous. You should try to understand where she's coming from and have an open conversation about it. It's possible that you can find a middle ground where you're not jealous, but still show her that you care and value her."
* "I'm on the OP's side. Jealousy is a toxic emotion that can ruin a relationship. If you're not feeling it, it's probably because you're a healthy and secure person. You should be proud of yourself for overcoming your past issues and not letting jealousy control you. Your girlfriend might need to work on her own insecurities and trust issues instead of expecting you to be jealous." (multiple comments)

**Conclusion:**

The majority of commenters agree with the OP that jealousy is a toxic emotion that can destroy a relationship. They suggest that the OP's girlfriend might be feeling insecure because she's used to him being jealous, and that he should communicate with her about how he feels and why he doesn't get jealous. Some commenters also suggest that the girlfriend might need to work on her own insecurities and trust issues instead of expecting the OP to be jealous. Overall, the subreddit community seems to be supportive of the OP's decision to not let jealousy control him and to prioritize a healthy and secure relationship.

TITLE: [26 M] My girlfriend is coming over to break up with me in 2 hours please help me find the words to make her change her mind.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. She is my best friend, and she is about to leave me. She went on a trip out of town for 12 days and barely called me. When she got home she was distant, hanging out with friends avoiding me. I grew angry and confronted her. I've always felt like I was second string to her friends, but I don't care about any of that now. I just want her to not leave a relationship we both loved and cherished for 5 years over a cold fight that lasted a little over 6 days. I've loved her since the moment I saw her, I just want her to give this more time.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is coming over to break up with me in 2 hours, I want to make her change her mind. What can I say to make her stay?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. But honestly, if she's already made up her mind to break up with you, there's not much you can say to change it. You've had 5 years to work on your relationship, and if it's come to this, it's likely because there are deeper issues that need to be addressed. Instead of trying to convince her to stay, maybe take this as an opportunity to reflect on what you can do differently in the future."
* "I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that you can't force someone to stay in a relationship they don't want to be in. If she's made up her mind, it's likely because she's already moved on or has realized that the relationship isn't working for her. Instead of trying to convince her to stay, maybe focus on having an open and honest conversation about what went wrong and how you can both move forward."
* "I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that you can't change someone's mind by trying to guilt trip them or make them feel bad for leaving. Instead of trying to convince her to stay, maybe focus on having a calm and respectful conversation about what you both want and need from each other. And if she's still decided to leave, maybe take this as an opportunity to reflect on what you can do differently in the future."

TITLE: Girl [25 F] with Male [28 M] can you go back to the getting to know phase once you have had sex?

POST: I wanted the internets opinion because my co-worker and I argued at length about this and got nowhere. 

So guy meets girl and they exchange numbers, talk and flirt all that jazz. They keep trying to organise a date but both are really busy. She suddenly decides to comes cover to guys house late one night, stays the night because he lives close to her work. They have sex.  

Now my question is can they go back to being a cute and trying to arrange a date and get to know each other or is she now a fuck buddy?

My view is she is now a fuck buddy. My co-worker says if he is really keen on her he will still take her out on a date because now he knows he will definitely get some.  I think he is just saying that just because.

TL;DR: Had sex on first night, can they go back to getting to know each other or is she now a fuck buddy?

---

**Top comments:**

* "I think it's a bit of both. She's already crossed the line by sleeping over and having sex, but if he's still interested in getting to know her as a person, he can still try to make it work. It's up to him to decide if he wants to keep things casual or try to build something more."
* "I think your co-worker has a point. If he's really interested in her, he'll still want to take her out and get to know her better. But if he's just looking for a quick hookup, then yeah, she's probably just a fuck buddy now."
* "I think it's important to remember that sex doesn't necessarily mean you're committed to each other. If he's still interested in getting to know her, he can still make an effort to do so. But if he's just looking for a casual thing, then yeah, she's probably just a fuck buddy."
* "I think it's a bit of both, but also a bit of a grey area. If he's still interested in getting to know her, he can still make an effort to do so. But if he's just looking for a casual thing, then yeah, she's probably just a fuck buddy. It's up to him to decide what he wants."

**Conclusion:** The majority of the comments agree that it's a bit of both, and that it's up to the guy to decide what he wants. Some comments suggest that if he's still interested in getting to know her, he can still make an effort to do so, while others think that sex has already changed the dynamic and that she's probably just a fuck buddy now.

TITLE: Do American kids have a "dinosaur phase"?

POST: I'm from New Zealand. It's pretty much a secular country, ie politicians speaking about God is a big no-no. A lot of people are Christian but for the most part they are not fundamentalists, and most of them believe in evolution. Evolution is taught in science class in high school.

As a kid in New Zealand, pretty much every boy (and probably some girls) go through a "dinosaur phase", where they are really into dinosaurs. Their parents buy them dinosaur toys and book and computer games. The primary appeal is obviously the fact that dinosaurs are awesome giant scary monsters, but they also end up learning about the Cretaceous period and the Jurassic period and how many millions of years ago the dinosaurs lived.

So I read that [almost half of the American population doesn't believe in evolution] Coming from a scientific background, this just seems absolutely insane to me. Regardless of what you believe, the [body of evidence for evolution] is enormous enough that a person who denies it is denying fact and reason. But I don't want this is to turn into an evolution debate.

My question is, if a large portion of America doesn't believe in evolution, then do they still let their kids learn about dinosaurs? Do the kids still have a "dinosaur phase"? I know Creationists have a few ways of [justifying dinosaurs without evolution] but it just seems to me that the topic of dinosaurs is something that most Creationist parents would want to sweep under the carpet. I don't know.

Caveat: I know things are different in different states and different communities. If you don't want to generalise, tell me about your specific upbringing.

TL;DR: Do American kids still have a "dinosaur phase" if their parents don't believe in evolution?

---

**Comments:**

* "I'm an American and I went through a dinosaur phase as a kid. My parents are Christian, but they're not fundamentalists and they taught me about evolution in school. I think it's because dinosaurs are just so cool and fascinating, regardless of how they evolved."
* "I'm from a conservative Christian family and I went through a dinosaur phase too. My parents didn't really care about the evolution thing, they just wanted me to learn about the dinosaurs themselves. I think it's because dinosaurs are a way to connect with the past and learn about science without having to deal with the whole evolution controversy."
* "I'm an American kid and I'm in elementary school right now. My parents are Creationists, but my teacher is really cool and she teaches us about dinosaurs in a way that doesn't mention evolution. We learn about how God created the dinosaurs and how they lived a long time ago. It's actually really fun!"
* "I'm an American and I went through a dinosaur phase as a kid, but my parents are secular and they taught me about evolution in school. I think it's because dinosaurs are a way to learn about science and the natural world, regardless of how they evolved. It's not about the evolution, it's about the dinosaurs themselves."
* "I'm an American and I went through a dinosaur phase as a kid, but my parents are Creationists and they didn't want me to learn about evolution. They taught me about dinosaurs in a way that didn't mention evolution, and it was actually pretty boring. I think it's because they didn't want me to learn about the 'theory' of evolution and how it's just a way to explain how life on Earth changed over time."

**Conclusion:**

The comments show that American kids can still have a "dinosaur phase" even if their parents don't believe in evolution. Some parents may choose to teach their kids about dinosaurs in a way that doesn't mention evolution, while others may focus on the scientific aspects of dinosaurs without delving into the controversy surrounding evolution. The comments also highlight the diversity of opinions and approaches to teaching science in American schools. Overall, the "dinosaur phase" seems to be a universal experience for many kids, regardless of their parents' beliefs about evolution.

TITLE: Me [32F] with my BF [35M] three years, he broke up with me suddenly via email and then asked to stay together still.

POST: Up until last week everything seemed fine to me. We were not fighting and there were no major issues. Then seemingly out of the blue he was depressed/upset for a few days, then he broke it off with me via email. A day later he asked to talk about it and he decided he wants to stay together to work on the problems together (apparently he felt like he was losing himself and it was all about me, although he said I did nothing to make him feel that way, it was his mindset).

I ended up taking him back but I am not sure if I am ignoring a huge red flag here. This was completely out of character and I feel like everyone makes mistakes, but am I being a doormat?

TL;DR: BF broke up with me via email, then asked to stay together to work on issues. I took him back but am unsure if I'm ignoring a huge red flag.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's not taking responsibility for his actions and is trying to manipulate you into staying with him. If he's willing to break up with you via email and then suddenly change his mind, that's a huge red flag. You deserve better than someone who doesn't respect your feelings or boundaries."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I agree with the above comment. It's not about making mistakes, it's about how he handled the situation. If he's willing to break up with you via email, that shows a lack of respect and empathy. You should be asking yourself if you're willing to settle for someone who doesn't value your feelings."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're considering taking him back. Are you doing it out of fear of being alone, or are you doing it because you truly believe he's willing to work on the issues? If it's the former, you might want to re-evaluate your decision. If it's the latter, you should have a long conversation with him about what he's willing to do to make things work."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should also consider the fact that he's blaming his depression/upset on you, saying it was all about him losing himself. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who takes responsibility for their own emotions and actions, not someone who blames you for their problems."
5. **RationalRuth**: "I think you should take a step back and assess the situation objectively. If he's willing to break up with you via email and then ask to stay together, that's a pattern of behavior that's not healthy. You deserve someone who respects your feelings and boundaries. Don't settle for someone who doesn't value you."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are overwhelmingly in agreement that the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag and that the OP should be cautious about taking him back. The comments suggest that the boyfriend's lack of respect, empathy, and responsibility are major concerns and that the OP deserves better. The OP should take time to reflect on their feelings and consider whether they're willing to settle for someone who doesn't value their feelings and boundaries. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but the comments provide a valuable perspective on the situation.

TITLE: [Realtionships] Me [21 F] with my husband [31 M] of 1 1/2 years, keeps trying to suckle my breasts during sex and doesnt really respect my boundaries.

POST: We were intimate after I apologized for being very nitpicky and argumentative lately and he said he really wanted to suck on my breasts (which I know he loves and I do let him do sometimes) He attempted to once and I stopped him and continued but once the second time came around (attempting to do it again) I pushed his face away got upset and stopped sex. I asked what he was doing and he claims he was not trying to do this and "doesnt know" what he was trying to do.  He also got upset that he didnt climax and I got upset that I felt I was disrespected and made to feel uncomfortable and then guilty on top off that.

TL;DR: Husband tries to suckle my breasts during sex, doesn't respect my boundaries, and gets upset when I stop him and sex ends.

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of one year, I can't figure out if we should stay together or not.

POST: So I have no doubt that I love my boyfriend. We've had a really tough first year. Lots of short break ups. I've been dealing with a new anxiety problem and its been tough on both of us. 

At one point we broke up long enough that I met someone very interesting, went on a date, had the best sex of my life. I remembered what it felt like to be lusted after or wanted.

Ever since that break I can't decide if I want to be with him or be single. What I love about being single is feeling wanted. I know my bf loves me but he never lusts for me. If I ever have doubts he never fights for our relationship. He tells me he just wants me to be happy, but if he showed some passion towards being with me it would fufil that need to be wanted. 

Also our relationship is kind of stagnate. Were both in the same exact situation as last year. I'm worried that he isn't focused enough on becoming successful. 

But our relationship provides love, comfort, support, the best friendship I've ever had, openness. These things I know I won't find from dating. And these things are so important for me. 

For some reason feeling wanted makes me feel like I'm at my best. I'm the most confident I can be. I feel good. And this need is enough to make me doubt wanting to be in my relationship. I literally cannot decide which is more important to me.

TL;DR: I'm 20F, been with my 22M boyfriend for a year. We've had a tough year, and I've been dealing with anxiety. I had a great experience with someone else, and now I'm unsure if I want to stay with him or be single. I love him, but I feel wanted when I'm single, and I'm worried about the stagnation in our relationship.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're trying to find a solution to your anxiety by seeking external validation. Feeling wanted is not the same as feeling loved and appreciated. You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are, not just someone who lusts after you. Have an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and see if you can work through this together."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It sounds like you're looking for a sense of excitement and passion in your relationship, which is normal. However, it's important to remember that relationships are about more than just lust and excitement. They're about building a life together, supporting each other, and growing as individuals. Have you talked to your boyfriend about your feelings and what you're looking for in your relationship? It's possible that he's not aware of your needs and desires."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being unfair to your boyfriend. Just because he doesn't lust after you in the same way that you do doesn't mean he doesn't love and appreciate you. Everyone has different love languages and ways of showing affection. Maybe he shows his love and appreciation in other ways that you're not recognizing. Have you tried to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and needs?"
4. **u/anonymous_user**: "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you really want from your relationship. Are you looking for a sense of excitement and passion, or are you looking for a sense of security and stability? Are you willing to work through the challenges and difficulties that come with any relationship, or are you looking for an easy and effortless ride? Once you have a better understanding of what you want, you can have a more informed conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and needs."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're struggling with a common issue in relationships - the desire for external validation. Feeling wanted and loved is important, but it's not the only thing that matters in a relationship. You need to consider what you're getting from your relationship and what you're putting into it. Are you happy with the level of intimacy and connection you have with your boyfriend? Are you feeling fulfilled and satisfied in your relationship? If not, then it may be worth exploring whether this relationship is truly right for you."

TITLE: Me [29/M] with my girlfriend [32/F] 2 years, her ex-boyfriends family.

POST: my current girlfriend of two years as a close relationship with her ex-boyfriends family. And she wants to go hang out with them (ex won't be present) me personally don't like the idea and I think is wrong and disrespectful. She knows I don't like it that's why she has not seen them since we been together but still talks to them biweekly at least once. She invited me to come with her but I don't think that's a good idea and it will be really awkward. But she says she's going to see them soon with or without me and I don't know how to deal with this. What would you do if you are in this position? Also do you think it's worth leaving somebody over it?

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to hang out with her ex-boyfriend's family, I don't like the idea and think it's wrong. She says she's going to do it with or without me. What would you do?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's her decision whether or not to hang out with her ex's family. If you're uncomfortable with it, you can have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. But ultimately, it's not up to you to decide what she does or doesn't do. If you're not comfortable with it, you might need to reevaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you."
* "I would have a conversation with her about why you're uncomfortable with it. It's possible that she doesn't realize how you feel or that she has a different perspective on it. If she's still not willing to compromise, then it might be a sign that you're not compatible."
* "I think it's understandable that you're uncomfortable with it, but it's not necessarily wrong or disrespectful. People move on and still maintain relationships with their ex's family. If you're really that uncomfortable, you could try to find a compromise, like going with her to a public place or setting boundaries around how much time she spends with them."
* "I would say that it's not worth leaving someone over this. Relationships are about compromise and understanding. If you're really that uncomfortable, you could try to find a compromise or have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. But ultimately, it's not worth sacrificing the relationship over something that's not a deal-breaker."
* "I think it's important to remember that her ex's family is still a part of her life, even if she's moved on. If she's still close with them, it's not necessarily a bad thing. You could try to find a way to be more open-minded and understanding about it. It might be worth having a conversation with her about why you're uncomfortable and seeing if you can find a compromise."

TITLE: My coworkers do not ask me[f21] to go to lunch with them

POST: I am a 21 year old female programmer intern at a very small company. This is my second time working here after interning in a previous semester. I get along well with a majority of my coworkers but I'm timid and I dont know how to say "Can I go to lunch with you guys?" When a group of them leaves to get food together. Every day one of the guys who started working here while I was gone comes in and asks a few of the guys to come to lunch with him. But no one ever asks me if I'd like to join. 

There are also 2 other interns. One of them makes it very clear, indirectly, he has no desire to interact with me socially (He was here last time). The other one is new and I havent said more than 10 words to him since we started, but I would like to try to be more social with my coworkers by going out to lunch with them and I dont know how to approach this situation without coming off needy or something? 

sorry if this is the wrong place; direct me to the right subreddit if there is a better one?

TL;DR: I'm a 21 year old female programmer intern who wants to go to lunch with her coworkers but is too shy to ask. She's worried about coming off needy or awkward.

---

**Comments:**

1. OP, you're not being needy for wanting to socialize with your coworkers! It's completely normal to want to build relationships outside of work. Try saying something like, "Hey, I'm going to grab lunch, want to join me?" or "Do you guys usually go out for lunch? I'd love to join you sometime." It's casual and doesn't put pressure on anyone to say yes. - u/socialbutterfly23
2. I'm a programmer too, and I totally get it. It can be tough to break the ice. Maybe try striking up a convo with the new intern and see if you can bond over something? And don't worry about the other intern who doesn't want to interact with you socially - you can't force someone to be friendly, but you can still be friendly to them. - u/ codingforcookies
3. OP, you're not alone! I've been in similar situations where I wanted to socialize with coworkers but was too shy. Try making a small group lunch invitation, like "Hey, [coworker's name], want to grab lunch with me and [new intern's name]?" That way, it's not just you asking to join the group, but you're also including someone else. - u/ shyprogrammer
4. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your shyness and wanting to work on it! Remember that it's okay to take small steps and start small. You don't have to go from 0 to 100 in one day. Start by saying hi to your coworkers in the morning, or asking them about their weekend. Those small interactions can add up and help you build confidence. - u/ confidencecoach
5. OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, and if someone doesn't want to hang out, that's okay. You can't force someone to be your friend. But if you do get the chance to go to lunch with your coworkers, enjoy it! It's a great way to bond and have some fun outside of work. - u/ chillcoworker

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all so much for your comments! I really appreciate the advice and encouragement. I think I'll try saying something like "Hey, I'm going to grab lunch, want to join me?" or "Do you guys usually go out for lunch? I'd love to join you sometime." And I'll also try to make small group lunch invitations like "Hey, [coworker's name], want to grab lunch with me and [new intern's name]?" Thanks again for your help! - u/ shyprogrammer

TITLE: How do I [24M] move forward with live-in SO [34F]?

POST: The points: 

* I work in IT and am a pretty solitary guy, having her in my life makes me so much more at ease.  I have general anxiety so this is important.  

* I've never really felt "love" from anyone but her, I had a messed up childhood so having someone this close to me is new and exciting

* My college days were relatively intense, I'm yearning for the excitement of being single again but don't want to hurt SO, I'm constantly thinking about peers my age, eyes always wandering, not sexually attracted to SO anymore

* She's from another country on a student visa, been living with me for 8 months.  she moved in because she was living with 6 other girls in a 2br place, all worked at the same whip-wielding restaurant to pay for school

* Obviously hurting someone sucks and the feeling of being alone is terrifying (new city, no close friends)... but I do feel trapped, like I could be growing a lot more.  Was formerly polyamorous, jumped into this on impulse.  

* I told her I never intend on getting married or having kids.  She accepted that, we've been monogamous for 18 months 

* she doesn't know many other people so I offer some level of security, but taking that away by breaking up would ruin a big part of her life, she might go back home

TL;DR: I'm 24M, live with 34F SO, feeling trapped and restless, unsure how to move forward.  We've been monogamous for 18 months, she's on a student visa, and I'm worried about hurting her.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I think you're feeling trapped because you're not being honest with yourself about your feelings. You're not in love with her, you're just comfortable with her. You're also not being honest with her about your feelings. You need to have a real conversation with her about what you want and what you're feeling. It's not fair to keep her in the dark and then wonder why she's upset when you break up with her."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being unfair to your SO. She's been living with you for 8 months and you're just now feeling restless? That's not fair to her. You need to take responsibility for your own feelings and actions. If you're not happy in the relationship, then maybe it's time to reevaluate and see if it's really what you want."
3. **u/itscomplicated**: "OP, I think you're feeling trapped because you're not sure what you want. You're not in love with her, but you're also not ready to be single again. You need to take some time to figure out what you want and what you're willing to work for. It's not fair to your SO to keep her in limbo like this. You need to have a real conversation with her and be honest about your feelings."

TITLE: 14 Tillion Dollars, What Does Reaching the Debt Ceiling Really Mean?

POST: Aparently on monday the United states has reached its debt ceiling of 14 trillion dollars, and while i'd like to consider myself fairly well informed on how it got into this position of massive debt im not entirely clear on what reaching a debt ceiling means for the American economy.

Proposals from both sides of the political spectrum say that a reduction of spending is needed (with democrats proposing raising taxes in the upper braket?) but how big of a chunk of an anual budget would really be needed to put a dent in 14 trillion? You dont accumulate that kind of debt over night and i have difficulty seeing exactly how any reduction could even allow them to break even let alone start reducing this debt load given the rather large deficit administrations have been running.

And lets say for a minute that they cant figure out a way to ease off this debt ceiling, what are the consiquences for inaction? What are other means of solving this issue?

TL;DR: The US has reached its debt ceiling of 14 trillion dollars. What does this mean for the economy? How can we reduce this debt? What are the consequences if we can't?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "The debt ceiling is just a arbitrary number set by Congress. It's not like there's a magic limit that says 'oh, you've reached 14 trillion, now you have to start paying it off.' It's just a way for Congress to exert control over the government's spending. In reality, the government can still borrow money and pay its bills, it just can't do it without Congress's permission. So, in a sense, the debt ceiling is just a tool for Congress to use to negotiate with the President and other lawmakers."

2. **u/economicwizard**: "The problem with the US debt is that it's not just the amount of debt, it's the interest on that debt. The interest on the debt is what's really killing us. Right now, the interest on the debt is around 400 billion dollars a year. That's a huge chunk of change. If we could just reduce the interest on the debt, we could make a big dent in the overall debt. One way to do that would be to raise the interest rate on government bonds. This would make it more expensive for the government to borrow money, but it would also make it more attractive for people to invest in government bonds, which would reduce the interest rate. It's a delicate balance, but it's something that could be done."

3. **u/financialgenius**: "The best way to reduce the debt is to grow the economy. If we can get the economy growing at a healthy rate, then we'll have more revenue coming in and we can use that to pay down the debt. The problem is that the economy is not growing as fast as it should be, and that's because of a lack of investment in infrastructure and education. If we can get those things going again, then we'll be in a much better position to reduce the debt."

4. **u/concernedcitizen**: "I'm not an economist, but it seems to me that the government is just kicking the can down the road. They're not really addressing the underlying issues that are causing the debt to grow. They're just making promises to cut spending and raise taxes, but they're not really doing anything to address the root causes of the problem. Until we start addressing the real issues, like the growing income inequality and the lack of investment in infrastructure and education, we're never going to get out of this mess."

5. **u/optimist**: "I think the best way to reduce the debt is to focus on the long-term. We need to think about what kind of country we want to be in 20 or 30 years, and then work towards that. We need to invest in things that will benefit future generations, like education and infrastructure. We also need to think about how we can make our economy more competitive, so that we can attract more businesses and create more jobs. If we can do those things, then we'll be in a much better position to reduce the debt and create a brighter future for ourselves and our children."

TITLE: Me[18F] want to help my little brother [17M] with ideas to come closer to a [16F] girl in school.

POST: My brother has a crush on a girl for at least a half year. She has start the same school as he but they don't hang out in the same groups. He does text with her on facebook and on the mobile, but he don't know any ideas for getting them to know each other better. He has been on dances and even danced with her one evening, but when he asked her if they could be together she said that she don't know him so well yet...

This issue is something that he only speaks to me about, not our mother and I will be moving to another town in a couples of weeks and I just want to help him. I'm not so good in dating tips, because I just talked with my now SO of soon 2 years one night and met him the next day and then we were together. (Short story). 

He and I live in a small village and she lives in a village maybe 15 km away. The nearest town is about 45 km away and we live in Finland. They both have only mopeds and every cinema, bowling hall etc. is in the town 45 km away (30 km from her house). He doesn't want my mother to know everything, because she's very annoying with these kinds of stuff..

Any advise, like things they could do, tips for him? I'll be very happy if I could help him a little. :)

TL;DR: My 17-year-old brother has a crush on a 16-year-old girl in school and wants to get to know her better. He's been texting her, but doesn't know what to do next. I want to help him, but I'm not great at dating advice. Any tips or ideas would be appreciated!

RESPONSES:

1. OP, it's great that you want to help your brother! Since you're not familiar with dating advice, I'll give you some general tips. First, it's important to remember that your brother should respect the girl's boundaries and feelings. If she's not interested in getting to know him better, he should accept that and move on.

One idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to study together or hang out in a group setting, like a movie night or a game night. This way, they can get to know each other in a more casual setting. He could also try to find common interests or hobbies they both enjoy, and use those as conversation starters.

It's also important for your brother to be himself and not try to be someone he's not. If the girl is interested in getting to know him better, she'll appreciate his authenticity.

2. OP, it's great that you're trying to help your brother! I think it's sweet that you're looking out for him.

One idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to go on a bike ride or a walk together. Since they both have mopeds, they could ride together and enjoy the scenery. This way, they can get some exercise and have some quality time together.

Another idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to help him with a project or a task. This could be something like helping him with his homework or working on a group project together. This way, they can collaborate and get to know each other better in a more practical setting.

Remember, the most important thing is for your brother to be respectful and genuine in his approach. If the girl is interested in getting to know him better, she'll appreciate his efforts.

3. OP, I think it's great that you're trying to help your brother! I have a few ideas that might help.

One idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to go to a concert or a festival together. Since they both live in a small village, they might not have many opportunities to go to events like that. This way, they can have a fun and exciting experience together.

Another idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to help him with a creative project. This could be something like writing a story together or making a video together. This way, they can express themselves creatively and get to know each other better in a more artistic setting.

Remember, the most important thing is for your brother to be respectful and genuine in his approach. If the girl is interested in getting to know him better, she'll appreciate his efforts.

4. OP, I think it's great that you're trying to help your brother! I have a few ideas that might help.

One idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to go on a picnic together. Since they both live in a small village, they might not have many opportunities to go on a picnic. This way, they can enjoy the outdoors and have some quality time together.

Another idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to help him with a sports team or a club. This could be something like joining a soccer team or a book club. This way, they can work together towards a common goal and get to know each other better in a more structured setting.

Remember, the most important thing is for your brother to be respectful and genuine in his approach. If the girl is interested in getting to know him better, she'll appreciate his efforts.

5. OP, I think it's great that you're trying to help your brother! I have a few ideas that might help.

One idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to go to a coffee shop or a cafe together. Since they both live in a small village, they might not have many opportunities to go to a coffee shop. This way, they can have a casual and relaxed conversation and get to know each other better in a more low-key setting.

Another idea could be for your brother to ask the girl if she'd like to help him with a charity event or a volunteer project. This could be something like helping at a local animal shelter or participating in a charity run. This way, they can work together towards a common goal and get to know each other better in a more meaningful way.

TITLE: My [18 M] Ex [18 F] of 3 months says she misses me but doesn't love me. Can I start feelings again?

POST: My ex broke up with me because she lost feelings. She tells me that it was a good relationship and she wishes she didn't lose feelings but she had to do what was right and not stick around just for my sake, which I understand and am thankful she didn't. 

My Ex and I still talk almost every day, and recently I sent her a snaphat of one of 'our songs' with a funny caption. She texted me almost immediately saying that she is upset and misses me heaps, but she still has no feelings so we won't be able to date again.

My question is, how to I start those feelings up again? I miss her too and wish we didn't break up so I want to try and get her to catch feelings again but I don't know how to go about it especially when it seems like she is rejecting the idea of trying?

TL;DR: Ex says she misses me but doesn't love me. We still talk daily. Want to know how to get her to catch feelings again.

---

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's unlikely you'll be able to'start feelings up again' if she's already told you she doesn't have them. It's not about you, it's about her emotional connection to you. If she's not feeling it, it's not going to magically come back just because you try to rekindle things. You deserve someone who loves you for who you are, not someone who's just going through the motions. Take this as an opportunity to focus on yourself and find someone who truly loves and appreciates you."
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I understand why you'd want to try, but it's important to respect her boundaries. If she's told you she doesn't have feelings for you, it's not fair to keep hoping or trying to change her mind. Instead, focus on building a strong connection with someone else who genuinely loves and appreciates you. You deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are, not someone who's just going through the motions."
* **u/sad_panda**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's tough to accept when someone doesn't feel the same way. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? Let her know that you miss her and value your friendship, but you also need to know that you're not going to keep holding onto hope if she's not going to reciprocate. Sometimes people just need to be honest with each other and move on. You deserve someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."
* **u/throwaway789**: "I think you're being unrealistic about this. If she's told you she doesn't have feelings for you, it's not going to change just because you try to rekindle things. You need to accept that it's over and move on. You deserve someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are, not someone who's just going through the motions. Take this as an opportunity to focus on yourself and find someone who truly loves and appreciates you."



**Conclusion:**

The community's response is overwhelmingly in favor of accepting the reality of the situation and moving on. Many users suggest that it's unrealistic to expect someone to suddenly develop feelings for you if they've already told you they don't have them. Instead, they encourage the OP to focus on building a strong connection with someone else who genuinely loves and appreciates them. A few users also suggest having an open and honest conversation with the ex about how they're feeling, but ultimately, the consensus is that it's time to move on and focus on oneself.

TITLE: Me [27F] with my friends [20sF] of 6 years, am I just being ridiculous?

POST: Last summer I met a girl online who we'll call Jo. Jo had just moved to my city, and we met up and became friends. I introduced her to my friends and she started coming to our group get togethers.

Over the months, I started realizing that Jo was extremely high maintenance and controlling. I felt like every few weeks she would be angry at me about something trivial.

The final straw was when I offered to introduce her to one of my single guy friends. She asked me to find out if he was interested. Unfortunately he was not, and when I told her this she took it out on me like it was somehow my fault. That was the final straw. I felt like our friendship was toxic and told her that she was too demanding and I couldn't be friends anymore. This was about three weeks ago.

I didn't tell any of my friends in the group (except for one because I sought her advice) because I didn't know what to do. Now I feel like she's doubled how much she's hanging out with my friends and I am going to run into her this weekend.

R/Relationships, please give me a reality check here. Is it completely wrong of me to tell my friends what happened? I feel bad putting them in a position to choose, but on the other hand I have been friends with all of them for years and want their support. I don't really know what to do. I've never been in this situation before.

TL;DR: I had to cut off a friend who was high maintenance and controlling. I'm worried about running into her this weekend and don't know if I should tell my friends what happened. Am I being ridiculous for wanting their support?

---

The post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users offering advice and support. Some common themes include:

* It's not ridiculous to want your friends' support, and you have every right to share what happened with them.
* You don't owe anyone an explanation for cutting off a toxic friend, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.
* It's understandable that you're worried about running into Jo, but you can't control how others behave. Focus on taking care of yourself and setting boundaries if necessary.
* Consider having a conversation with your friends about what happened, but also be prepared for them to have their own opinions and reactions.
* Remember that you're not responsible for Jo's behavior or emotions, and you did the right thing by setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs.

Overall, the community is supportive and understanding, and many users are offering words of encouragement and advice to help the OP navigate this difficult situation.

POST: We've been dating for almost two years. My GF will often have 2-3 guys she is "texting" at a time. I assume they are all harmless convos but I cant get the worst case scenarios out of my mind like she is cheating on me with these guys or something. She says they are just friends but it doesnt ease my mind much. And I know she doesnt mean any harm by it. She's an attention craver. I think it stems back to daddy issues since she didnt grow up with a dad or much attention as a child. Anyway the problem is that sometimes she'll receive a text and I know its from one of these guys. I feel like this shouldnt be a big issue but I have a lot of insecurities when it comes to girls texting other guys. Ive had bad relationship exprriences with this in the past. Anyway my first instinct is to badger her about it. Asking things like, "whos that?" or "is that a guy?". Its just the way I am to be nosy like that but its not good. Any time I ask she gets really defensive and irritated that I ask so many questions and feels like I dont trust her. I know that me being like this is only hurting my relationship. 

How do I get over these insecurities and stop being so nosy?

Is this normal?

Do I have a right to ask these questions? 

Thanks!

TL;DR: My GF texts other guys and it makes me insecure. I know she says they're just friends, but it's hard for me to shake the feeling that she's cheating. I don't want to be nosy, but I feel like I have a right to know who she's talking to. How do I get over my insecurities and stop being so nosy?

**Top comments:**

1. "I think you're being a bit too controlling. It's not about you having a right to know who she's talking to, it's about respecting her boundaries and trusting her. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't assume the worst about her."
2. "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for women to have close friendships with men. Just because she's texting them doesn't mean she's cheating. Maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with her and trust her to make good choices."
3. "I think you're being a bit too paranoid. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should take a step back and reflect on why you're feeling that way. Is it because of past experiences or is it because of something specific about your current relationship? Either way, it's not healthy to be constantly questioning her every move."
4. "I think you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't assume the worst about her. Maybe she's just trying to be friendly or help someone out. Trust her and have an open and honest conversation about your feelings."
5. "I think you're being a bit too controlling. It's not about you having a right to know who she's talking to, it's about respecting her boundaries and trusting her. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with her and trust her to make good choices."

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP's insecurities are likely stemming from past experiences and a lack of trust in his current relationship.
* It's not about having a right to know who she's talking to, but about respecting her boundaries and trusting her.
* The OP should focus on building a stronger connection with his GF and having open and honest conversations about his feelings.
* It's not uncommon for women to have close friendships with men, and it doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.
* The OP should reflect on why he's feeling insecure and address the root cause of his feelings.

TITLE: Should I[f21] tell my parents that my SO[m22] is traveling across the Atlantic to visit me while I'm in Europe?

POST: My parents are Indian, and though they are fairly open-minded with most topics, they don't approve of my white boyfriend who I've been dating for almost 2 years (I told them about him 1 year ago). I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more'serious'? I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama. But is this a cop-out?

TL;DR: My white boyfriend is visiting me in Europe for a few weeks while I'm doing an internship. My Indian parents don't approve of him and I'm unsure if I should tell them about the visit.

TITLE: I [22F] need advice about my sister [20F], depressed college drop out furry.

POST: Last week my sister told me that is now a furry. 

My sister dropped out of university after one semester two years ago. She's been living with my parents since then. She goes to a community college, but she has failed most of her classes there. She has almost no friends, and she spends most of her time alone in her room. She is very into anime, cosplay, MLP, and is now making a 'fursuit'. I'm very concerned about her. She seems to have no goals, dreams, or ambition and she keeps falling into weirder and weirder crowds. I've suggested that my parents kick her out into a student apartment, so that she will be surrounded by other girls her age. 

She will be 21 soon, on her way to adulthood, and she has shown no sign of growing up. She finally got her first minimum wage job about a month ago. My parents have saved up around 20K for her college fund, so she has the resources to go to college, but she cannot seem to pass her classes. She began taking Vyvanse for ADHD a few months ago, but I do not know if that has made any improvement. She has had boyfriends, but every one of them has been jealous and abusive.

She had an extremely abusive boyfriend a few years ago, who apparently beat and raped her before my parents got her out of that relationship. She has been in counseling because of that, and was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. I'm sitting here with my Mom and we're pretty much at a loss here on how to handle this.

TL;DR: My sister, 20F, dropped out of college, is depressed, has no friends, and is now into furries. She has no goals, dreams, or ambition, and I'm worried about her future. She's been in counseling for PTSD and ADHD, but I don't know if it's helping. I'm at a loss on how to help her.

TITLE: My [22 F] father [47 M] just told me he is dating someone my older sister's [25 F] age. Feeling conflicted with the information.

POST: My parents are separated and have been for going on three years. My mom moved away and I still live with my dad while I finish University. 

My dad has been seeing someone and when this person comes over he asks me to not be at the house. The other day, after a few nights of this, he told me the reason that I couldn't be there was that the girl he is seeing is 25 and she thought I would judge her.

 I feel like I have been put in a very awkward position because my older and younger sister don't know about it. I want to talk to them but I also don't want to tell them because I would have honestly preferred not knowing about it.

TL;DR: My dad is dating someone 25 years old, my older sister's age, and he asked me not to be at the house when she comes over. I feel conflicted about not knowing about it and not wanting to tell my sisters.

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: the struggle to navigate complex family relationships, particularly when it comes to parents and their romantic partners. The OP (original poster) is feeling conflicted about her father's new relationship, which is not only with someone significantly older than her but also with someone her older sister's age.

The OP is torn between her desire to keep the information private and her sense of loyalty to her sisters, who do not know about the relationship. She is also struggling with the fact that her father has been keeping this information from her and her sisters, which makes her feel like she is being left out of the loop.

The post is likely to elicit a range of responses from the community, including advice on how to handle the situation, concerns about the age gap between the OP's father and his new partner, and questions about why the OP's father is keeping the relationship a secret. The post may also spark a larger discussion about the challenges of navigating complex family relationships and the importance of communication and honesty in these situations.

TITLE: Me [20 M] broke up with my SO [19 F] of 3 years a month or two ago.... Where do i even start to rebuild my social life and look for new relationships?

POST: I poured all my time into her and my hobbies, i have a few friends online that have moved far away and no one in person currently to spend time with at all. I don't know how to meet new people currently. I'm fixing to be going into Bartending but i don't necessarily want to meet people at my job... Where do I begin? Its at the point that i might be ready to start dating again, but i'm not sure where to start with that either... 

I'm quite the nerd and enjoy lots of stuff other people would think is geeky or nerdy so this MIGHT be a factor to consider.

TL;DR: Broke up with SO of 3 years, no friends in person, no idea how to meet new people or start dating again.

TITLE: Me [21F] with my almost-boyfriend?[25M] met at one night stand, been seeing for a week, great guy, scared of him drifting away

POST: Been with this guy for a week. Knew him previously, but didn't really talk. We both got it on at a party, now we're seeing each other, kind of. Still extremely fresh. Since then we've hung out a couple of times, at the beach, and talked for hours. I'm actually starting to really like this guy and want to be with him and get to know him better. He's got a business trip for 10 days as of tomorrow though, so we won't be able to hang out. Should I say anything? Should I text him much? He has been the one taking me places for us to hang out and stuff but I don't want to seem clingy or annoying, it's one of my peeves actually. We text a couple of times a day and he always responds with really long texts.

I had a bad experience a few years ago and am still a bit scarred mentally. When I was with him today we were quite intimate with hugging and kissing and I'm scared I came off as "awkward". So I told him very superficially what happened in the past. He just looked at me for a long time and gave me a long hug.

I'm scared to scare him away, nobody seems to give me long enough for me to "open up" and get totally comfortable with. And this guy is really worth it. I know it's super early yet, but I want to give it my all, and I'm scared he'll drift away because of how I might act or whatever.

TL;DR: Met at one night stand, been seeing each other for a week, guy has business trip for 10 days, scared of drifting away, want to know how to handle it.

REPLIES:

* "Hey, it's normal to feel scared and unsure about how to handle this situation. But it sounds like you're already taking steps to open up and be vulnerable with this guy. That's huge! Don't worry too much about scaring him away, just be yourself and communicate openly with him. If he's worth it, he'll understand and appreciate your honesty. And hey, even if he doesn't, you'll learn more about yourself and what you want in a relationship. Either way, it's a win-win!"
* "I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's always scary to open up and be vulnerable. But trust me, it's worth it. Just be honest with him about your feelings and concerns, and see how he responds. If he's a good guy, he'll listen and try to understand where you're coming from. And if he doesn't, then maybe he's not the right guy for you. Either way, you'll learn more about yourself and what you want in a relationship."
* "I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You're not being clingy or annoying, you're just being honest and open with your feelings. That's what relationships are all about! Don't worry about scaring him away, just focus on being yourself and enjoying the time you have together. And hey, even if he does drift away, you'll learn more about yourself and what you want in a relationship. Either way, it's a win-win!"
* "I think you're putting way too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and enjoy the time you have together. Don't worry about scaring him away or not being good enough. Just be yourself and see where things go. And hey, even if he does drift away, you'll learn more about yourself and what you want in a relationship. Either way, it's a win-win!"

Overall, the community is supportive and encouraging, offering words of wisdom and reassurance to help the OP navigate this new relationship. They emphasize the importance of being honest and open with their feelings, and remind the OP that it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. The community also acknowledges the OP's past experiences and offers words of encouragement to help them overcome their fears and anxieties.

TITLE: Dont know if I [M,24] should end it with my gf[F,23]

POST: My gf works at reception in an hotel, so she only has 1 day off work. This week they gave wednesday and she went with Two friends [m,f] to some restaurant/bar, afterwards she went with them to his friend apartment.

Then they started to smoke weed and she tells me she got uncomfortable and left because she has never tried it. She was previously drinking and it was 5am, so she wasn't in her best condition. so after some time of walking and looking for a cab she was stranded in an unknown place, maybe not that secure. 

She called me but I was half sleep and we weren't speaking for some previous discussion. I didn't say much and she didn't told me what was happening but her voice sounded like she was sobbing.  Anyway, the following day she calls and tells me that same story but that she called his ex bf because she panicked, and he picked her up and left her in her flat. she says they didn't do anything, that he just gave her a ride to her flat.

We been dating for 5 months and been together as a couple for 7; I think we have a good honest relationship, sometimes we argue but after a few days we are ok and have a great time together. Also his exbf is sort of a douchebag and previously cheated on her, and uses coke so not really a trustworthy person.

TL;DR: My girlfriend went out with friends, got drunk, smoked weed, and ended up in an unknown place. She called me, I didn't answer, and the next day she told me she called her ex's bf for help. I'm feeling unsure about our relationship and don't know if I should end it.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're being a bit harsh. She made a mistake, but it's not the end of the world. Have a talk with her about it and see how she feels about it. Maybe she's not proud of what happened and is willing to work on it."
* "I agree with OP, this is a red flag. She's not being honest with him and is seeking help from someone she knows is not trustworthy. That's a sign of a deeper issue."
* "I think you're overreacting. She's 23, she's allowed to make mistakes. It's not like she's doing it regularly. Just have a calm conversation with her and move on."
* "I would end it. She's not respecting your boundaries and is putting herself in dangerous situations. You deserve better."
* "I think you should talk to her about it, but also consider the fact that she's been with her ex's bf before and that's a huge red flag. You deserve someone who is committed to you and not seeking help from someone who has a history of cheating."
* "I would give her the benefit of the doubt, but also make it clear that you're not happy about what happened. If she's willing to work on it and be more responsible, then maybe it's worth continuing the relationship. But if she's not willing to listen and change, then it might be time to reevaluate."

**Conclusion:** The comments are divided on whether the OP should end the relationship or not. Some people think that the girlfriend made a mistake, but it's not the end of the world and that they should have a talk about it. Others think that this is a red flag and that the girlfriend is not being honest with the OP and is putting herself in dangerous situations. The comments also bring up the fact that the girlfriend has a history with her ex's bf, which is a huge red flag. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP to decide what he wants to do with the relationship.

TITLE: Thinking about therapy, implications for employment? Specifically: Peace Corps.

POST: I've been thinking about seeking some type of therapy (most likely CBT) for awhile now to help me deal with some social anxiety and negative thinking issues for some time. I've never done this sort of thing before and while I think I'm doing pretty well in bettering myself on my own, I'd like to make more progress and get an outside opinion on some things.

My concern is that if I seek therapy, and use my insurance to help pay for it, that this information could somehow be used against me when looking for employment. I just submitted an application to the Peace Corps and as part of that application it asked if I had ever seen a psychologist and if so, the date I saw them last. I answered no, which is true, but if I now go see a therapist and don't tell them, then I'm likely breaking rules that if they found out, could lead to my termination (and I guess possibly fines/jail).

Is there any way for them to find this out if I don't tell them? I really feel that it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them and I don't want it to influence my chances. Thanks!

TL;DR: Considering therapy for social anxiety and negative thinking, worried about potential implications for employment with the Peace Corps if I don't disclose it on my application. Is there any way for them to find out if I don't tell them?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Be honest**: "I would advise you to be honest about your therapy on your Peace Corps application. It's better to be upfront and transparent about your mental health than to risk being discovered and potentially facing consequences. Remember, the Peace Corps values honesty and integrity, and hiding the truth could damage your reputation and relationships with your fellow volunteers."
* **Check the application**: "Before you start therapy, take a closer look at the Peace Corps application and see if there are any specific questions about mental health or therapy. If there are, make sure you're prepared to answer them honestly. It's better to be upfront and honest than to risk being discovered later."
* **Talk to a Peace Corps representative**: "If you're still unsure about what to do, consider reaching out to a Peace Corps representative or a recruiter to ask about their policies on mental health and therapy. They may be able to provide you with more information and guidance on how to handle your situation."
* **It's not a secret**: "Remember that seeking therapy is not a secret or a shameful thing. Many people seek therapy to improve their mental health and well-being, and it's a sign of strength and self-awareness. Don't be afraid to be open and honest about your therapy, and don't worry about what others might think."
* **Consider a waiver**: "If you're still concerned about the potential implications of seeking therapy, you may want to consider asking for a waiver or exception to the Peace Corps' policy on mental health and therapy. This could be a good option if you're willing to provide additional information or documentation to support your request."

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:**

* The Peace Corps' website has a section on mental health and wellness, which includes information on seeking therapy and counseling.
* The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a section on employment and mental health, which includes information on how to disclose mental health issues to potential employers.
* The American Psychological Association (APA) has a section on mental health and employment, which includes information on how to navigate the workplace with mental health issues.

TITLE: Me [21 F] and my boyfriend [20M] for almost 2 years, broke up due to long distance; left it in a bad place

POST: We were together for almost 2 years at uni, and we even lived together. But I moved across the world for a year abroad of uni, and after about 3 months the strain became too much. 

We mutually broke up, and we were both  ok. But afterwards I didn't take it well; I drunkenly text and rang him. So I decided to delete him off facebook to stop myself from embarrassing myself further. 

This didn't really work, and the last time we talked was when I tried to call sober to clear the air but he was angry that I was contacting him again. He said we'd talk in a few months when I was over it but I told him I didn't want to be friends.

That was a few weeks ago and I don't know what to do. I feel so awful that I have lost not only my boyfriend but my best friend, and the idea that we can't even be friends really saddens me. I know I was in the wrong and I was so over dramatic, but I feel this is mostly to do with the fact I'm not really enjoying my time abroad.

I kind of wish I'd never left my home country and him, I was happy there. I don't know what I expected to find here but I haven't.
Should I just leave this and move on?

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend due to long distance, had a messy breakup, and now I'm feeling awful and regretful. I miss him and our relationship, but I know I was in the wrong. Should I just move on or try to make amends?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling so awful. Is it really just the breakup, or is it the fact that you're not enjoying your time abroad? Maybe you're feeling lost and unsure of what you want. Take some time to figure that out before trying to rekindle things with your ex."
* "I think you should try to make amends. You said you were in the wrong and you were over dramatic, so it's clear you're willing to own up to your mistakes. Maybe reach out to him and apologize for your behavior. Who knows, he might be willing to talk and work things out."
* "I think you should just move on. You said you were in the wrong and you're feeling regretful, but you also said you were happy with him in your home country. Maybe it's time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. You can't change the past, but you can work on yourself and move forward."
* "I think you should try to stay in touch with him, but not as a romantic partner. Maybe you can be friends or acquaintances. You said you miss him and your relationship, but you also said you know you were in the wrong. Maybe having a connection with him can help you heal and move on."
* "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. You said you're not enjoying your time abroad, so maybe it's time to re-evaluate your priorities. You can't change the past, but you can work on yourself and find happiness in the present."

TITLE: Me[18M/F] with my ___ [18M/F] duration, short-description

POST: [Previous Post](

---

So I snooped again because I saw a text pop up from him last week on her phone.

Last Saturday night, she texted him out of the blue just before 10pm saying "what u up to tonight?". This is a week after he last texted her and she didn't respond. This was in a 20 min gap when she wasn't with me. She was drunk too.

She then met up with me shortly after at 10pm so didn't respond to any of his texts for the rest of the night/she got too drunk to function and I had to take her home.

The rest of his texts were about asking her to meet up etc with last text being at 1am. This is when I saw the text as I was still up and her phone was on the table. I decided not to snoop further at that stage.

She hasn't text back since then.

I know all of this because I only decided to snoop last night because it's been bugging me ever since. She got blind drunk last night so I had to meet up with my mate and her on the street and help her get home. She was in memory blank drunk mode. On a work night too. Which just made me think wtf is going on with her so I snooped when she was passed out.

Also remembered something she said to me a few weeks ago, she said

"I used to text other guys when I was with my past boyfriends, because basically I got bored, but with you I don't have to because you're so fun" or something like that.

And ever since she said that it's been in the back of my mind, contributing to my insecurity, and has me thinking oh is this the start of this sort of behavior.

I think you guys are right that I don't trust. And I have to admit it too. I don't trust her that much at the moment due to her behavior and my insecurities.

TL;DR: Girlfriend texts old flame while drunk, I snoop and find out, she hasn't responded since, and I'm feeling insecure about her past behavior.

---

TITLE: TIFU by zoning out and burning myself

POST: This fuck up happened less than 30 minutes ago... do I get a prize?

Background: I am a high school student and I generally pride myself for being part of the upper group as far as intelligence is concerned, but after my fuck up, I have been considerably humbled. 

The Fuck Up: I was in chemistry today and we were doing a lab. In this particular lab we were using a little bowl called a crucible.  The crucible was still wet after being washed at the end of the last class, therefore the first instruction was to heat it over a burner to dry it out. 

We heated the crucible for the required two minutes and sat it at the table to cool, as it was cooling I began to read the instructions for the next step, which required us to find its  mass. My mind had begun to wander from the lab, when I remembered what needed to be done. I promptly said "Let me just mass this." I grabbed the crucible. The blazing hot, just heated by fire for two minutes crucible. It burned, seeking to remove it from my hand and stop the pain. I flung it to the ground and it shattered. 

The looks I received from my teacher and the other students were those of bewilderment. They were bewildered at how I could be so stupid as to grab an incredibly hot crucible. I am shamed, and my burned finger hurts.

TL;DR: I grabbed a hot crucible and burned myself, then dropped it and shattered it.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't zone out in class, and don't grab hot things.

TITLE: How do i not screw this one up?

POST: **Backstory:** im in my second year of college, i've been known to go out and sleep with a lot of girls.. not really my idea of a good night or anything, but it just kind of happens. havn't really had any real dating experience since freshman year of highschool, 4 girlfriends total, all cheated with close friends, i now have some trust issues, and generally just have sex with people (i have numerous fwb) 

**The Situation** so few weekends ago, at the usual bar with a couple of pals, my usual buddies but with some more people from our program. get to dancing with one of the girls, start flirting, figured id try and make a move, but kept being interrupted and she ended up getting really drunk and leaving, but afterwords she added me to facebook and started chatting. girls really cool, valentines day she texts me pretty upset, the guy shes screwing around with told her shes a side chick, ( something i to myself would probably do), so i comforted her, cheered her up abit, got to shooting shit. get the stones to ask her to come watch a movie, she comes over we cuddle for abit, chat all night, and she leaves, we've watched movies and cuddled every night since. 

**Where im at right now** ive told all of my fwb that its over, i genuinely do not wanna hurt this girl, and i have feelings for her.she just left from our "first date" i made her supper, we watched a movie, cuddled, she wants things to go slow because shes weary. but im falling hard.. 

**The Question**soo.. what can i do to help further this, without seeming desperate and overly attached, because with her its not even for sex, i just want her around 24/7.. 

Sorry that this got so long..

TL;DR: I've been sleeping around, got a girl who's been hurt in the past, we've been cuddling and watching movies, I want to make it work but don't want to seem desperate. What can I do to make it work without freaking her out?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're already in deep. You've got to slow down and let her set the pace. You're not going to change her feelings or make her fall in love with you overnight. Just be patient, listen to her, and let her know you're there for her. Don't put too much pressure on the situation."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I think you're getting ahead of yourself. You've only had a few dates, and you're already talking about wanting her around 24/7. Take it one step at a time. Focus on building a connection with her, and let the relationship develop naturally. Don't rush into anything, and don't put too much pressure on her."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with someone who's been sleeping around as much as you have. It's not that I'm judging you, but it's a big red flag for me. Have you considered taking some time to reflect on your past behavior and how it might be impacting your relationships moving forward?"
4. **LoveIsInTheAir**: "I think you're doing great so far! It sounds like you're being really thoughtful and considerate of her feelings. Just keep being yourself, and don't try to change who you are to impress her. If she's the right person for you, she'll appreciate your authenticity. Good luck!"
5. **RelationshipCoach**: "I think you're getting caught up in the romance of it all. Remember that relationships are about communication, trust, and mutual respect. Make sure you're prioritizing those things, and don't get too caught up in the emotions of the moment. Take things slow, and focus on building a strong foundation for your relationship."

TITLE: My[26M] fiancée [27F] is upset I stayed out late after a concert, I think she is over reacting.

POST: I am in a long distance relationship with my fiancée. I really like concerts, and go often. I went to a concert on Friday night, and meet an adorable couple at the show. We really hit it off with them. I liked him a lot, he was really cool, and she was really sweet/precious. We ended up staying out till 5 am and had a blast.

I normally text her when I am home, but apparently I passed out without properly hitting the button. (The message was all typed out and everything.) When I woke up at 9, I apologized for not texting her, because I know she wants me to be safe.

Last night, she basically said I was stupid and unsafe for doing what I did. I didn't know them, and I was not being smart. I told her that I really trusted them, and that they were harmless. She said she didn't care.

I have traveled the world. I have been to over 20 countries and backpacked with strangers for weeks, in the mountains. This makes me nervous that she thinks this was so dangerous, as this seems like such a small thing to me.

Am I thinking about this wrongly?

TL;DR: I went to a concert, met some cool people, and stayed out late. My fiancée is upset, saying I was stupid and unsafe. I think she is overreacting.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: differing perspectives on risk and responsibility. The OP (original poster) is a 26-year-old man who went to a concert, met some new people, and stayed out late. He thinks his fiancée is overreacting because he has traveled extensively and is used to taking risks. However, his fiancée is upset because she feels he was irresponsible and put himself in a potentially dangerous situation.

The OP's fiancée is likely concerned about his safety and well-being, and may feel that he was not being mindful of the risks involved in meeting new people and staying out late. She may also feel that he is not taking her concerns seriously and is not being respectful of her feelings.

The OP's response to his fiancée's concerns is to minimize the situation and tell her that he trusted the people he met and that they were harmless. However, this response may come across as dismissive and unempathetic, which may escalate the situation rather than resolve it.

To resolve this issue, the OP and his fiancée may need to have a more open and honest conversation about their differing perspectives on risk and responsibility. The OP may need to listen to his fiancée's concerns and acknowledge her feelings, while also explaining his own perspective and why he felt comfortable staying out late. The couple may also need to establish some ground rules for their relationship, such as setting boundaries around socializing and communication, to help prevent similar conflicts in the future.

TITLE: Me [20m] and my ex [20f] broke up due to her parents beliefs.

POST: This had been going on most of our relationship (6 months) but her parents go to a Church of Christ and long story short, if I'm not on par with their religion, then I'm not allowed to date her. They've met me once and didn't see that I was good enough so it wasn't allowed no matter what she tried telling them.  She's suffocated by them and doesn't know where she is on religion due to them forcing it on her. She definitely doesn't agree with a lot of their beliefs. 

We have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for 6 months, and I still have that feeling I got the the first week we dated. Now she broke up with me because we have been hiding it the whole time and she started getting frustrated with lying and being scared of them figuring out because the consequences would be pretty great.

Neither her or I are in the position to move out so options on how this could work are very limited. Talking to them really isn't going to do anything because they're so deep in religion, that there's no if, ands, or buts. We're in a rough spot and are both really stressed out and would like to be together but them finding out would not be pretty. Does anyone have an suggestions or experience with this? It'd be MUCH appreciated as I'm very upset and just want this all better.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Me and my ex broke up due to her parents' beliefs. We're both 20, and we're stuck in a situation where we can't move out. We're looking for suggestions on how to deal with this situation.

TITLE: [m24] currently dating a very young girl

POST: Currently I'm in a pretty good relationship with a girl who is younger than the "half your age plus 7" rule. Actually she has just hit the age of consent (16) and we have been dating pretty seriously for 5 months. Honestly I felt pretty bad about it in the beginning because when I was younger I always despised older guys dating really young girls. Now I have become what I once hated.... 

I truly felt when I was going to first meet her Chris Hansen was going to show up with some cameras.

But no, we have not had any sexual relations yet. However, I can honestly say I do like her for much more than that. She is much more mature,  honest and straight forward than other girls my age, which I find really attractive.

She has also told me her mother met her dad at the age of 15, married 5 years later and were happy ever since. This gives me some kind of hope.

Do Parents Know?: Currently her mother is only aware that we "talking" but not the depth of the relationship. I know her mother personally since she is a friend of the family. However, I have not introduced myself as her daughter's companion yet. I would rather do the whole meet and greet the family when she turns 18.

I'm wondering if there are currently any other redditors out there that have had a similar (successful) experience?

TL;DR: 24-year-old dating 16-year-old girl, feeling guilty, wondering if others have had similar experiences.

---

This post is a great example of how the "half your age plus 7" rule is often used as a guideline for determining whether a romantic relationship between an older person and a younger person is appropriate. The poster is struggling with the moral implications of dating someone who is significantly younger than him, and is seeking validation and advice from the community.

The post also highlights the importance of considering the age of consent and the potential power imbalance in such relationships. The poster mentions that they have not had any sexual relations with the 16-year-old girl, but it is still important to recognize that the relationship is still potentially problematic.

The community's response to this post is mixed, with some users expressing concern and others offering support and advice. Some users point out that the relationship is illegal in many places, while others argue that the age of consent is a societal construct and that the relationship should be judged on its own merits.

Ultimately, the post serves as a reminder that relationships between people of different ages can be complex and nuanced, and that it is important to consider the potential consequences and implications of such relationships. It also highlights the importance of respecting the age of consent and the autonomy of individuals to make their own decisions about their relationships.

TITLE: I [20/F] with my boyfriend [20 M] of 1.5 yrs, want to end things now during long distance though we'll be in the same city in two months.

POST: I have been dating a guy for about year and a half. I have been having feelings toward ending the relationship for some time now (and I've mentioned this to him). We are currently in different cities for the summer but we'll be in the same city by September (where we both attend school). I'm sure the physical distance between us now hasn't helped, but we visited each other recently and I didn't feel the spark that i used to. Is it terrible to end it during long distance when we'll be seeing each other again so soon? Do i wait and give it a chance to be saved when we get back? We are starting to feel like only friends. 
I know he does not want to end things. I feel stuck. I've met someone in this city whose sparked my interest. I feel guilty, but mentally this relationship has felt distant to me for some time.

Not sure if I should wait, doing it in person is usually suggested, or bite the bullet and do it now.

TL;DR: I'm 20F, been dating 20M for 1.5yrs, feeling distant and want to end things. We're in different cities now but will be in the same city in 2 months. Should I wait and give it another chance or end it now?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not terrible to end it during long distance. You've already been feeling distant for some time, and the physical distance has probably exacerbated that. If you're not feeling the spark, it's okay to acknowledge that and move on. Don't feel guilty about it, and don't wait just to avoid hurting him. You deserve to be happy, and if that means ending things, then so be it."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's okay to acknowledge that the distance has been tough, but also that you're not feeling the same connection you used to. If he's willing to work on things and meet you halfway, then maybe it's worth giving it another shot. But if he's not willing to listen or compromise, then it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
3. **u/sadbuttrue**: "I think it's okay to end things now, but also consider the timing. You'll be seeing each other again in two months, and ending things now might make the transition harder for both of you. Maybe have a conversation with him about how you're feeling, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being."
4. **u/justme123**: "I think you should wait until you're in the same city again. It's always better to have a face-to-face conversation about ending things, and it might give you both a chance to work through some of the issues that have been building up. Plus, you'll have a chance to see if the spark is still there when you're together in person. If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

**Community Insights:**

* 75% of commenters agree that it's okay to end the relationship during long distance, citing the physical distance as a factor in the relationship's decline.
* 20% of commenters suggest having an open and honest conversation with the boyfriend about feelings and concerns, with some recommending waiting until they're in the same city again.
* 5% of commenters advise against ending the relationship now, citing the potential for a fresh start when they're back in the same city.

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community is divided on whether to end the relationship during long distance or wait until they're back in the same city. Some commenters believe that ending things now is the best decision, while others suggest having an open and honest conversation with the boyfriend or waiting until they're together again. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that the community is here to support and offer advice.

TITLE: Wrongfully sent to collections. Please help.

POST: Just checked my credit score. Instead of the usual 679, I see 587. I start freaking at see that I have a collection agency after me for $679. T-Mobile sent me to collections on a phone that I returned to them months ago. I called them multiple times months ago after I got collection notices about it. The last rep I spoke to, probably 3 months ago, told me they received the phone back and all was fine. Then I check my credit score today, and this. I'M FUCKING BEYOND LIVID

TITLE: Me[26F] with my husband [38M] of six years, yells more and more everyday. How can I make it stop???

POST: My husband turned down an offer and hasn't received another one in two weeks. He has applied at 100+ places and is stressed. He has begun to yell. 

My husband grew up in a family where the dad yelled his wife and siblings into submission. I do not want my husband to become his dad. Within the last few weeks though he has. Today he even tried to yell me out so I'd succumb to his desires. He also has been turning things around and blaming me for everything. 

I want my calm loving husband back. Instead I have a man who yells. How can i solve this?

TL;DR: Husband yells more and more, blaming me for everything, and I want my calm loving husband back.

* "It sounds like he's really struggling with stress and anxiety. Have you considered couples therapy to help him work through these issues?" (u/couplescounselor)
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for someone to yell at you, especially not in a way that's meant to intimidate or control you. Have you considered setting boundaries with him? Let him know that you won't engage with him when he's yelling." (u/strongwomenrock)
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing the pattern of behavior and wanting to address it. Have you considered talking to him about how his upbringing is affecting his behavior? It might be helpful for him to understand where his yelling is coming from." (u/psychologynerd)

I want to save our marriage, but I don't know how to make it stop."

Have you considered setting some boundaries for yourself, like taking a break from the relationship if he continues to yell at you?" (u/strongwomenrock)
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing the pattern of behavior and wanting to address it. Have you considered talking to a therapist on your own? Sometimes it can be helpful to have a neutral third party to talk to about your feelings and concerns." (u/therapist)

TITLE: [19/m] I am in my freshman year of college with my girlfriend [18/f]. I am having an easier time adjusting and it's putting a strain on our relationship.

POST: I'll try to make this as brief as I can.

My girlfriend and I started dating during our junior year in high school and we ended up going to the same university. When we first moved in, we were both a bit overwhelmed, and it was really helpful to the both of us that we had each other during the transition. 

Since I have always adjusted pretty easily to new situations, I started to become pretty comfortable around week 3. I have gotten know a ton of people, I've made new friends and I've been doing very well in all my classes.

She, on the other hand, has been having a tougher time. She feels like she hasn't made any friends, is really struggling in her classes, and she's feeling pretty lost. I've been doing everything I can to be there for her, and spend all the time with her that I can, but it seems like we're on two different wavelengths.

One of the main reasons we're running into trouble is that since I'm meeting a ton of people and having a great time, she's worried that she's holding me back from everything. The thing is, I want to meet new friends and everything, but I wanna do it with her. I always try to get her to hang out with my friends, but she never seems happy. When I ask her why, she always says "they're your friends, you all know each other."

It's beginning to feel like I have to choose between her and my friends, and I don't want that. I love being with her, but it seems like lately, I'm all she has. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long post!

(

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old freshman in college with my 18-year-old girlfriend. I'm adjusting well, but she's struggling. I want to spend time with her, but she feels like she's holding me back from meeting new people. I don't want to choose between her and my friends, but it's starting to feel like that's what's happening. Help!

TITLE: How do I start moving from college/parents to financial independence? (US)

POST: I'm starting this by saying that I realize I'm extremely lucky, and I don't want to fuck it up. I don't have a precedent for my situation, so I need your collective advice:

In a few years, I'll be leaving college with no debt. I've managed a very small part-time job in addition to being full time student ($2400 in 2012, which I will file taxes on!). I'm looking at ~$3000 for 2012, + an internship stipend (which won't be much).

I've been depositing my checks at a 2:1 Savings:Checkings ratio.

I don't have a car and I won't need one. My room and food is taken care of (I even managed to get free housing for the summer) while I'm in college, and my parents have offered me a (rent-free) couch while I'm job-searching post-graduation.

Basic goals for post-graduation:
Out of my parents' house by winter, into an apartment, with a job.
It's not very realistic, but some recent alum from my department have managed it.

What else do I need to consider? What do I need?

I've been reading posts here, but I haven't seen too many very beginner posts, and I did check out the FAQs, but I don't exactly have money to do anything with.

TL;DR: I'm a college student with no debt, a small part-time job, and a supportive family. I want to move out of my parents' house, get a job, and start building financial independence. What do I need to do?

TITLE: Furniture suggestions...long term project

POST: Hi there Just moved from NY to SF with my wife and we are going to start out on our first place together since we stopped being broke-2nd-hand-ikea-furniture users. Starting out so on a budget and honestly, have no idea how to think of interior design so looking for help.
This intends to be a long term project, one where i post pictures of before and after, compile a list of stores and design ideas!
Description: live in SF victorian apartment (well, plan on, once we find it! still in a sublet), not terribly large
So, first task: what are the core pieces of furniture in each room? For instance, in the bedroom, i am guessing its the bed that would decide the color and kind of accessories like chest of drawers? And in the living room, i suppose i should get a couch before anything else?

TL;DR: Help me with furniture suggestions for our first place in SF, on a budget, and with a long term project in mind!

TITLE: My apartment is infested with mice and management has done very little to help. What are my options?

POST: So I moved into my apartment back in May. Things have constantly gone wrong since day one. Now usually when something goes wrong they take a couple days to come fix which isn't a big deal as long as its not something serious. Shortly after moving in we noticed mouse crap in the cabinets. Then we stated seeing them. We told maintenance and they came by and put traps down. We caught a good 3 or 4 mice. Then we started catching 1 every couple of weeks and seeing/hearing them every couple of days. The apartment management just kept on sending us traps. Now the mice seem to have had babies because we see mice multiple times a day and they are getting into all of my food. management seems to think that providing us traps is all they have to do and its our problem. This is a serious problem that traps won't fix. We need an exterminator but they clearly don't want to pay for one to come. But this is a health risk in my opinion. Is there any sort of legal action I can take? Or at least threaten to take to get them to act?

TL;DR: Mice infestation in apartment, management has done little to help, what are my options?

COMMENTS:

* "Have you tried contacting your local health department? They may be able to help you get an exterminator or force the management to take action."
* "You should definitely consider contacting your local health department. They have the power to shut down the apartment complex if they deem it a health hazard."
* "I would also try contacting the state's department of housing and urban development. They may be able to help you get an exterminator or provide guidance on how to handle the situation."
* "You could also try contacting a local pest control company and ask them to come out and assess the situation. They may be able to provide you with a quote for extermination services and help you negotiate with the management."
* "I would also suggest keeping a record of all the interactions you've had with the management, including dates, times, and details of what was discussed. This can be helpful if you need to take legal action."
* "You may also want to consider talking to your neighbors and seeing if they're experiencing the same issue. If multiple units are infested, it may be a bigger problem than just your individual unit."
* "I would also suggest looking into your lease agreement and seeing if there are any clauses that address pest control. If the management is not meeting their obligations, you may be able to break your lease or negotiate a reduction in rent."
* "You could also try contacting a local attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law. They may be able to provide you with guidance on how to handle the situation and potentially help you take legal action."

This post and its comments demonstrate the frustration and concern that can arise when a tenant experiences a serious issue with their living space, such as a pest infestation, and feels that the management is not taking adequate action to address the problem. The comments offer a range of suggestions and resources that the tenant can use to try to resolve the issue, including contacting local health and housing authorities, seeking the help of a pest control company, and potentially taking legal action. The post and comments highlight the importance of clear communication and cooperation between tenants and management in resolving issues and maintaining a safe and healthy living environment.

TITLE: Not sure if I should approach my girlfriend about cheating on me [21m/f]

POST: This is something that's been eating at me for the last few months and I just want to get it off my chest.

Some back story. She had a boyfriend before me let's call him, John. She and John and a pretty rocky relationship from what I was told and witnessed myself. Anyway after a while they broke up and we got together and it was great. Fast forward to when I was away on holiday during Christmas 2012, she ends up seeing him and says how nothing happened between them. However after another incident in August she let me read through her texts and I found one from that day saying "Last night can't mean nothing. What was i thinking. Im not that type of person" And then a day or so after he sent something saying "Sorry about your neck" (she was big on biting necks and loves it done to her too)

So yeah she says she didn't sleep with him when she told me about this when it happened. But I don't think I believe her just because how she's lied to me in the past about seeing him and especially after reading those messages. Should I bring it up with her somehow or what? Thank you for reading it feels good to get this out.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on me with her ex, but says it didn't happen. Found incriminating texts. Should I confront her about it?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's been lying to you about seeing her ex and it's hard to trust someone who's lied to you before. I would have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you feel and what you've found. Be prepared for her to deny it again, but at least you'll know where you stand."
* "I would definitely bring it up with her. It's not fair to you to keep this secret and it's not healthy for your relationship. You deserve to know the truth and have an honest conversation about what happened. Just make sure you approach the conversation calmly and don't accuse her of anything. Let her know how you feel and what you've found and see how she responds."
* "I think you should be careful about how you approach this conversation. It's possible that she didn't mean to hurt you and that she was just caught up in the moment. Maybe she was trying to get closure or something. I would try to have a calm and open conversation with her and see what she has to say. Don't assume the worst just yet."
* "I would not bring it up with her. You've already found the evidence, you know what happened. She's already lied to you about it. What's the point of having a conversation about it? You deserve better than someone who's going to lie to you and hurt you. Just be done with it and move on."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her, but make sure you're prepared for the possibility that she'll deny it again. You can't force her to tell the truth, but you can express how you feel and what you've found. Just be calm and respectful and see how she responds. And if she denies it again, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."

This subreddit post is an example of a common issue in relationships: infidelity. The OP (original poster) is unsure if they should confront their girlfriend about cheating on them with their ex. The comments offer a range of advice, from having a calm and honest conversation with the girlfriend to being cautious and not bringing it up at all. The post highlights the importance of communication and trust in a relationship, and the difficulty of navigating situations where trust has been broken. It also shows how the community can provide support and guidance for individuals dealing with relationship issues.

TITLE: My boyfriend (23/m) cheated on me (21/f) over webcam after four+ years

POST: So me and my boyfriend have been together for four and a half years! We recently moved out together and have our own lovely apartment... Out relationship seemed to be like no other.. I never questioned the love, loyalty, and honesty we had for each other. We never hit rock bottom and we never had serious issues together. Everything was near perfect. About a month ago, I was on his computer and came across his Facebook.. Which was logged In already... Found mail from a girl that lead me to look on his Skype. Went onto his Skype and found something I wish I never found! My boyfriend had a very intimate Skype call and convo with a girl he got off a webcam site! The things he said to her really hurt me... He said things I have never heard him say! The call lasted 15 minutes and they were both naked on the call, doing you know what.. I do classify this as cheating and surely he would have known i thought that.. I am having a lot of trouble forgiving him... he tried to convince me at first how he thought it was not cheating, he has since tried showing me he made a big mistake.. But I don't know if I can get past this.. It's ruined the special relationship we had together and I don't feel like I love him the same way.

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 4.5 years cheated on me over webcam after I caught him on Skype with another girl. He says it wasn't cheating, but I'm having trouble forgiving him.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's understandable that you're having trouble forgiving him. Cheating is a huge betrayal of trust, and it's not something that can be easily forgotten. You deserve better than someone who would do something like this to you. Take the time you need to process your emotions and figure out what you want to do next."
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's not okay for him to cheat on you, and it's not okay for him to try to convince you that it wasn't cheating. You deserve respect and honesty in your relationship. Have you considered counseling to work through this together? It might be helpful to have a professional facilitate the conversation and help you both work through your feelings."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with your boyfriend's assessment that it wasn't cheating. Cheating is about the violation of trust, and it doesn't matter if it was over webcam or in person. It's still a betrayal. Have you talked to him about how you feel and what you need from him to move forward? It might be helpful to have a clear conversation about what you're looking for in terms of accountability and forgiveness."
4. **HeartbrokenHannah**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Remember that you don't have to forgive him if you don't want to. You deserve to be treated with respect and honesty, and if he can't provide that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own healing and well-being."
5. **ConcernedCounselor**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's not okay for your boyfriend to cheat on you, and it's not okay for him to try to minimize the hurt he's caused. It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of betrayal and hurt. Have you considered seeking counseling to work through these feelings and figure out what you want to do next? A therapist can help you process your emotions and develop a plan for moving forward."

TITLE: I (17M) asked a girl (16F) to homecoming that I hasn't gone to our school for over a year. How do I break the ice so it won't be so awkward when we meet?

POST: So I asked this girl I had a huge crush on last year to hoco via text. We didn't really talk much last year but getting to know her via internet she's a really cool and very intelligent girl and I grew the man power to ask her to go with me. 

Here's the problem, I haven't sent her in over a year and she lives half an hour away how do I break the ice so it won't be awkward when we see each other face to face. 

We're both really socially awkward and I feel like I set myself up for an awkward night. But she was really stoked I asked so I feel like she may have feelings for me.

TL;DR: Asked a girl to hoco after not talking to her in over a year, now worried about breaking the ice when we meet.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 17 and you're already worrying about being socially awkward? Just be yourself, be respectful, and have fun. She said yes, so she's probably excited to see you too." (23 upvotes)
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with her about not talking in a while and how you're excited to catch up. You can say something like 'Hey, it's been a while since we last talked, but I'm really glad you said yes to hoco. I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I'm excited to get to know you better again.' That shows you're interested in her and willing to put in effort to reconnect." (17 upvotes)
* "I think you should apologize for not reaching out sooner and explain that you were going through a tough time. Then you can move on to talking about hoco and what you're looking forward to. Just be genuine and sincere, and I'm sure she'll appreciate it." (12 upvotes)
* "Honestly, if she's okay with going to hoco with you after not talking in a year, she's probably not going to care about the awkwardness. Just relax, be yourself, and have fun. It's hoco, not a job interview." (10 upvotes)
* "I think you should consider having a conversation with her before hoco about how you're feeling and what you're hoping to get out of the night. That way you can both be on the same page and avoid any awkwardness. You can say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about hoco. I'm really excited to go with you, but I also want to make sure we're both on the same page about what we're looking for out of the night. Are you hoping to just have fun and enjoy each other's company, or is there something more you're looking for?' That shows you're interested in her and willing to have an open and honest conversation." (8 upvotes)

TITLE: Me [20 M] with [20 F], she apparently wants to meet me but I have no idea what to do.

POST: So I'm a student at a university and I've seen a girl around a few times from a distance who I thought was absolutely gorgeous. Since she is in a sorority and me a fraternity, I know a lot of her friends and when I asked them about her they were quick to tell me she's the perfect girl personality wise for me. So, one of our mutual friends who is really close to this girl told her about me and told me she wanted to meet me, gave me her number, and said it would be okay to text her so I did. We had a decent conversation going and it abruptly stopped. It was late, she probably fell asleep. So I followed the double texting rule and waited three days to try to reach out again. After I got the conversation going I asked her if she would like to meet me for coffee and she said she wouldn't be able to that week because of how busy she was with a weeklong philanthropy event. Even though she kept the conversation going for a while (that abruptly stopped again) I took it as a rejection and decided I wouldn't press it again. After that, I told another mutual friend who sits next to her in class and she said she actually was really busy with this philanthropy event and not to take it personal and that she'd talk to her about relationships without mentioning my name. So they talked and this girl told her a guy had been mean to her and she wanted to focus on school.

This was about three weeks ago, and her close friend said she'd give it one more try. I want to. This girl apparently is super sweet and has a great personality and I really want to get a chance to meet her but I don't know what to do and I'm scared of coming on too strong and creeping her out. What's your take?

TL;DR: Girl I've had a crush on for a while wants to meet me, but I'm scared of coming on too strong and don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, be respectful, and don't come on too strong. If she's interested, she'll let you know. If not, then you'll know too. Don't worry about it."
* "I think you're being too cautious. If she's interested, she'll make an effort to talk to you and get to know you. Don't wait for her to make the first move, take the initiative and ask her out on a proper date. You never know, she might be waiting for you to make a move."
* "I agree with the above comments. Just be yourself, be respectful, and don't overthink it. Also, don't assume she's not interested just because she didn't respond immediately. People get busy, and it's not uncommon for conversations to stop and start again. Give her space and let her come to you."
* "I think you should try to get to know her better before asking her out on a date. You can start by asking her about her interests, hobbies, and what she likes to do for fun. This will give you a better idea of whether you're compatible and will also help you build a connection with her."
* "I think you're being too focused on the 'what ifs' and not enough on the present moment. Just enjoy the conversation and see where it takes you. Don't worry about coming on too strong or creeping her out. Just be yourself and have fun."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are generally encouraging the OP to be himself, be respectful, and not overthink the situation. They suggest taking the initiative and asking her out on a proper date, rather than waiting for her to make the first move. Some comments also advise getting to know her better before asking her out, while others encourage the OP to focus on the present moment and enjoy the conversation, rather than worrying about the potential outcomes. Overall, the comments are trying to help the OP relax and be himself, rather than overthinking the situation.

TITLE: We did it! Review + Pictures!

POST: My husband (!!) and I tied the knot April 9th, we planned every little detail ourselves and paid for it ourselves. (Well with some help from my parents). And all decor was DIY'D. It was a LONG year and a half, but seeing it all come together was worth it!

Some things that went well...

* Seeing my husband's face during our first look. He bawled like a baby and it was the most treasured moment of the whole day and probably my whole life. 

* Our officiant killed it! We had guest after guest comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, some said it was the most emotional wedding they'd ever been too. And a friend's mom said our vows made her question her marriage (yeah, that was a weird comment). But it was worth it to custom curate our ceremony with our officiant, it was so special and even though I was so nervous I'm glad we wrote our own vows. 

Things that went wrong...

* My father in law hit my day of coordinator's car before the ceremony... I didn't find out about it until we checked into our hotel that night. But during our first dance it was funny to hear my husband go "I have so much to tell you..." Everything was fine though! He just scraped the side of her truck with his, but she handled it like a PRO. She just told him well, today is you son's day so we'll exchange info later and take care of it tomorrow, let's worry about the wedding first. She really was just fantastic all around.

Advice...

* Get a day of coordinator if you can. It is SO much easier than taking care of it yourself/having a friend or family member do it. We paid $500 for a DoC to setup/break down everything and she really made the day go smoothly and kept us on top of everything.

* Make as detailed of a timeline as possible. It was a little stressful coordinating who was leaving the hotel with who to the venue, etc. Also my husband had to pick a lot of people up at the airport, so maybe pay a friend from your area to be a designated taxi. It was different with us since 90% of our guests were out of town.

TL;DR: We did it! We planned our own wedding, paid for it ourselves, and had a beautiful day. Some things went wrong, but our day of coordinator was a lifesaver and we learned a lot along the way. If you're planning your own wedding, take it from us, it's worth it!

PICTURES:

[Insert 10-15 photos of the wedding, including the first look, ceremony, reception, and dancing]

This post is a great example of a successful wedding planning experience, with a focus on the emotional moments and the DIY elements. The author shares their story in a relatable and engaging way, including both the highs and lows of their experience.

TITLE: I'm (17m) not sure if I still love my gf (17f), and I think I have a crush on our good mutual friend (17f)

POST: So my gf (let's call her Amy) and I have been dating for over 3 years. We've gone through a lot of things together, good and bad. She was my first kiss, first gf, and I lost my virginity to her. We have had many talks about the future and getting married to each other. 

We regularly hang out with the same group of friends in and out of school. It consists of roughly 10 people. Around 3 of them are guys. The thing is we are all very close and hang out pretty much all the time. I've been getting very close to one of the girls in the group (let's call her Nancy). I was friends with her before I started dating Amy. Recently, I've gotten very close to Nancy. I've told her many things that I wouldn't even tell Amy. Some people have accused us up of "flirting" and have told Amy, who easily gets upset. Now, I'm a friendly person to begin with. I'm fine with making contact with all of my friends and I mess around with all of them, so I don't think of it as flirting. 

This has put me under a lot of pressure recently though. Since our group is mainly girls, I talk to girls pretty much everyday. But I feel like I have to act differently due to my gf. I feel like I can't laugh as much or talk as much, so Amy won't get jealous. 

Nancy trusts me and I trust her. We're pretty much best friends. But I think I might be developing a crush on her. 

I've started to care for Amy a little less, but I'm pretty sure I still love her. Breaking up with her would also be very awkward because we hang around the same group of people and our class is very small (97). Thank you.

TL;DR: I'm 17, been dating my girlfriend for 3 years, but I've been getting close to our mutual friend Nancy and I think I might have a crush on her. I don't know if I still love my girlfriend, but breaking up would be awkward because we're in the same class and social circle.

---

This post is a classic example of a relationship conundrum. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings for his girlfriend, Amy, but also has strong feelings for their mutual friend, Nancy. He's unsure if he still loves Amy, but breaking up would be difficult due to their close social circle.

The post highlights the complexity of relationships, especially when there are multiple people involved. The OP is torn between his feelings for Amy and his growing attraction to Nancy. He's also concerned about the potential consequences of breaking up with Amy, including the impact on their social circle and the awkwardness of being in the same class.

The post has sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many users offering advice and sharing their own experiences. Some have encouraged the OP to be honest with himself and Amy about his feelings, while others have suggested that he take a step back and re-evaluate his relationships.

The post has also raised questions about the nature of relationships and the importance of communication. How can the OP navigate his feelings for Amy and Nancy without hurting either of them? How can he communicate his feelings to Amy and Nancy in a way that is respectful and honest?

Ultimately, the post highlights the challenges of navigating complex relationships and the importance of being honest with oneself and others. It's a relatable and thought-provoking post that has sparked a valuable discussion on the subreddit.

TITLE: I just got a call about my grandpa...I need your help reddit.

POST: Growing up I always knew there was something off about him. I loved him to pieces, but he was always adamantly anti-government and anti-corporation. I know a lot of us redditors are too but as time went on its manifested its self in different ways.

We went to the movie theater one day and he complained that someone took a picture of him. He thought he was being spied on and wanted to leave. (There was no one there, it was in his mind)

Our family got a call yesterday, and it seems now he won't even leave his trailer to get food. He told the neighbor that the voices told him to stand in a hole in his house to keep people away. He's getting worse, and tomorrow I'm going to be going with my mom and anut to help deal with the situation.

I was reading on wikipedia that only.3 -.7% of the population is effected Schizophrenia; which is what we believe it is as this point. I'm really hoping I can find someone to help me out here. Have you known someone who has had Schizophrenia, how did you deal with it? Any advice you can give us?

TITLE: I [25F] just amended bad blood with my ex [27M] and now desperately need help with a response.

POST: My ex and I dated for 6 1/2 years and it ended HORRIBLY! He started all but dating this other girl while we were still together (emotional cheating, never anything physical). The thing is, the whole time I was reading his texts behind his back and saw his conversations with the girl, our mutual best friend, and his sister all shit talking me while having this relationship develop. I felt so crazy constantly reading his texts but everytime I would look I would find something for months. Finally, I got the strength to dump him, told him I hate him and never talk to me again, and got a new BF about a month later and we're so happy together and living together now. The ex is still with the same girl. 

TODAY I contacted my ex for the first time in a year and a half. I just said I don't hate you and I'm sorry for how I reacted. He said he was so happy I didn't hate him and gave me some updates about his life. It's been friendly messages and it feels like this weight is lifted off my shoulders because I don't have this burned bridge out there in the universe. (my current bf knows everything and is perfectly fine with me getting the closure I need). 

Here's the thing: I've always, always thought for the last year and a half that I will finally be completely healed once I can tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. He only told me that he went to the library with her once, so he thinks I just reacted in a crazy strong way over that. I need to say to him: Look, I reacted so strongly because I was reading the texts between you and her, you and our mutual friend, and you and your sister. I saw all the shit you talked about me and I thought that you hated me which made me want to hate you. I need to say something like that to him now to finally put this all behind me but I don't know how to say it without making myself seem insane and like I'm still living in the past. I need advice on this desperately please help.

TL;DR: I just reconnected with my ex after a year and a half and I desperately need help figuring out how to tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. I don't want to seem insane or like I'm still living in the past, but I need to say something to finally put this all behind me.

**REPLIES:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You're not being insane, you're being honest. You have every right to be upset and hurt by what you saw. If your ex is still with the same girl, he's probably still not being entirely truthful with you. Just be honest and direct, and don't worry about what he thinks. You're not trying to hurt him, you're trying to heal yourself.
2. **SarcasticSally**: OP, I think you should just tell him the truth. You're not going to get closure by sugarcoating it or beating around the bush. Just be honest and say, "Hey, I know you think I overreacted, but I was reading your texts and I knew what was going on. It hurt me and made me feel crazy. I'm just being honest with you now so we can both move on." If he can't handle the truth, then maybe he's not the person for you.
3. **ConcernedCitizen**: OP, I think you should consider whether or not this conversation is really necessary. You've already moved on with your life and are happy with your new partner. Is it really worth reopening old wounds and potentially causing more drama? Maybe just leave the past in the past and focus on your present and future.
4. **HonestHank**: OP, I think you should be honest, but also be prepared for the possibility that your ex might not take it well. He might get defensive or try to downplay what happened. Just remember that you're not responsible for his reaction, you're just trying to be honest and move on. If he can't handle the truth, then maybe he's not the person for you.
5. **WiseWoman**: OP, I think you should take a step back and consider why you're really reaching out to your ex. Is it really about closure, or is it about seeking validation or attention? If it's the latter, then maybe you should focus on your own healing and growth instead of trying to get something from your ex. Remember, you don't need his approval or validation to be happy and fulfilled.

**CONCLUSION:** The OP is seeking advice on how to tell their ex that they reacted strongly because they were reading his texts and knew the whole situation. The responders offer a range of advice, from being honest and direct to considering whether or not the conversation is really necessary. Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what is best for themselves and their own healing process.

TITLE: Me [24, M] with my girlfriend[23, F] have been together long distance almost a year, needing advice on long term plan.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but it's been entirely long distance (9 hours apart) with us taking turns seeing each other on weekends twice a month, and spending a week together on a couple occasions. 

My girlfriend was job hunting at the beginning of this past summer when there were two jobs opening up. One about 20 minutes from my house, another an hour further north of where she had been living. The job that was further away gave her $10K more a year than what she would've made living by me. I had no problem encouraging  this path because we had only been together a few months at that time, and wouldn't want her throwing her future away for me. 

Due to some unfortunate circumstances (my dad being in the hospital, her having to work multiple hours of overtime, a couple deaths in her family, etc.) we haven't been able to see each other this month and during the holidays. She told me a few weeks ago that she felt bad that she couldn't come home to me and felt lonely even though we can and do Skype, and basically that the distance is hurting her. I had already been thinking about moving up there, but was going to wait until the school year is over so I don't leave my employer in a sticky situation.

I'm a teacher at a private school, and even though my pay isn't awful, I'd be the one to make the move since it's an easier move for me. It also helps that I have friends that live in and around the same city she lives and works in. I want to offer to move up there, but don't know how to bring it up to her as we've been somewhat distant with everything going on.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been long distance for almost a year, she got a job an hour away from where she was living, and I'm considering moving up there to be with her. I want to know how to bring it up to her without making her feel like I'm trying to dictate her life.

---

This post is seeking advice on how to approach the topic of moving to be with his girlfriend, who is now living an hour away from her previous location due to a job opportunity. The OP (original poster) is a teacher and is considering making the move to be with his girlfriend, but is unsure of how to bring it up to her. He is concerned about not wanting to make her feel like he is trying to dictate her life.

The post is well-written and provides a clear background of the situation, including the challenges they have faced due to the distance and the OP's concerns about making the move. The OP is seeking advice on how to approach the conversation with his girlfriend and is open to suggestions on how to make the move work for both of them.

The post has received a number of comments and responses, with many people offering advice and suggestions on how to approach the conversation. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* Being honest and open with your partner about your feelings and concerns
* Considering the potential impact of the move on your partner's life and career
* Being willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you
* Communicating regularly and openly with your partner to ensure that you are both on the same page

Overall, this post is a great example of how to seek advice and guidance from others in a respectful and open-minded way. The OP is willing to listen to others and consider their perspectives, which is an important part of building a strong and healthy relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source.

POST: So this happened a few weeks ago on my holiday to India. Back story: Indian toilets don't usually have toilet paper and are more often than not simply a hole in the ground that you squat over. I went to deposit a particularly nasty load of liquid shit or what the locals refer to as "Delhi belly". I'd also recently been given some very expensive glasses by my parents and was under pain of death not to lose them. So I was squatting down unleashing this never ending torrent of diarrhoea when my glasses dropped off my head and fell down the hole. In a state of blind panic and fear I shoved my hand into the bottomless pit of shit in an attempt to find my glasses and, after dipping my arm elbow-deep in shit, eventually discovered them and pulled them out. As they were covered in shit I didn't put them on and instead stumbled around outside half blind to find somewhere to wash them off, finding a small shack surrounded by what I assumed was a queue of people with a huge urn of water inside. Pushing through the crowd, I quickly rinsed my shit covered arm and glasses in this urn of cold water, returned the glasses to their rightful place and, feeling rather pleased with my lucky escape, strolled outside. I then realised my FU....the queue was full of people holding various jugs and cups and a sign on the shack read "DRINKING WATER" in bright red bold letters.

TL;DR: I contaminated an Indian village's drinking water source by washing my shit-covered arm and glasses in the urn of drinking water.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't be a dumb tourist and always respect local customs and traditions. Also, don't be a dumb tourist and don't wash your shit-covered arm and glasses in the drinking water. 

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and embarrassing tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author's mistake was contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source, which is a serious issue in many parts of the world.

The post is well-written and engaging, with a clear and concise summary of the events that led to the author's mistake. The use of vivid language and descriptive phrases, such as "nasty load of liquid shit" and "blind panic and fear", adds to the humor and entertainment value of the post.

The moral of the story is clear and relevant, emphasizing the importance of respecting local customs and traditions, as well as being mindful of one's actions and their potential consequences. The post is a great example of how a TIFU story can be used to educate and entertain, while also promoting cultural awareness and sensitivity.

TITLE: Combining finances with my soon to be husband, but I owe him $25,000

POST: My fiance and I are beginning to combine finances and working through our plan for that. That's not the problem. 1 year ago my fiance paid off my car loan to help me with the accumulating interest. I had/have every intention of paying him back and now I'm in a financial situation where I can. However, our incomes are now going into our joint bank account and it's basically "our money". We talked about putting the repayments into a seperate account that is essentially "his", but we're not sure if that's the best way to go about it. I will not be able to pay this off completely for a couple years as we are saving for a house as well, so we don't want to wait until I finish paying him back before combining finances.

TL;DR: I owe my fiance $25,000 for paying off my car loan, but we're combining finances and I'm not sure the best way to handle the repayment.

TITLE: My boyfriend want to give me an "allowance". [F 18]

POST: Throwaway for identity reasons.

My SO [m 18] and I [f 18] have been dating for five, almost six years and are very serious, despite being so young. We don't live together and he works all week, so we don't see each other very often either. Out of nowhere he starts telling me I need to accept more from him. More gestures, gifts...money. I didn't know how to respond. I've heard of a husband doing this for his wife and vice versa, but never a boyfriend for his girlfriend. After refusing this multiple times, he said *this*, "It'll make me happy." How would it make him happy? How should I respond? Should I take it?

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants to give me an "allowance" and I don't know how to respond. I've never heard of a boyfriend doing this before. How would it make him happy and should I take it?

TITLE: Me [19F] with my boyfriend [22 M] 6 months, he constantly posts half-naked pictures on instagram

POST: So he and I both have instagram but I don't post anything just because I like to keep my life private and I'm not crazy about the whole social media thing. 

I have no problem with him posting stuff, I like to see all the cute stuff he posts, and he often posts pictures of us. But he also posts shirtless pictures of himself, and sometimes girls will comment saying how attractive he is or whatever. 

Am I right to be uncomfortable? I haven't said anything because I don't want to be controlling and I don't really think it's my place. But really, I compliment him all the time and tell him how good looking he is, why does he need constant validation from random strangers on instagram? 

My ex was not into social media that much and I liked that about him. Maybe there are just different types of people, and I am not really compatible with current bf? The attention-craving attitude is really a turn off for me.

TL;DR: Boyfriend posts half-naked pictures on instagram, gets attention from girls, I'm uncomfortable but haven't said anything because I don't want to be controlling. Am I right to feel this way?

COMMENTS:

* You're not being controlling, you're being honest about your feelings. It's okay to have boundaries and communicate them to your partner. Maybe have a conversation with him about how you feel and see how he reacts.
* I would definitely talk to him about it. It's not about being controlling, it's about being comfortable with your own relationship. You deserve to feel good about yourself and your partner, not constantly worried about what others think.
* I think it's great that you're acknowledging your own feelings and not trying to change him. Maybe he's just trying to feel good about himself, but it's okay to tell him how you feel and set boundaries.
* I would say something, but also try to understand where he's coming from. Maybe he's trying to build his confidence or something. But at the same time, it's okay to set boundaries and communicate your feelings.
* I think you're being really mature about this. It's not about being controlling, it's about being honest and open with your partner. I would definitely have a conversation with him about it.

Overall, the comments are supportive and encouraging, with many people agreeing that it's okay to have boundaries and communicate them to your partner. Some people suggest having a conversation with your boyfriend to clear the air and understand his perspective, while others encourage you to prioritize your own feelings and comfort level in the relationship. The tone is generally non-judgmental and focused on helping you navigate the situation.

TITLE: Last night I got promoted at work...twice. I've been working there for a week. What are some of your work success stories?

POST: As is custom, I'll start. 

For one reason or another, my full time job ended up not having any work for me to do during the summer, so I decided to take a part time job. A statewide-famous sandwich shop in my state decided to open up a new store in my town, and I applied and was hired immediately. I started training last week, and we opened the store up for the first time this week.

Yesterday, while pulling a double covering for someone else, my boss informs me that I've been promoted, including a raise and further duties with closing the store and sending reports off to the franchise at the end of the night, etc. I'm pleased, since a promotion in a week seems like a good thing to me. Fast forward two hours, and my boss has a personal emergency. He pulls me into his office, explains the situation, and says, "I hate to drop this all on you tonight, but I'm gonna need you to take over as manager. I figured it'd happen anyway, but wanted to give you more time to ease into it. You gonna be okay to do it?" I accepted, and he left to handle his business, with me in charge of two teenagers who'd worked there just as long as I had.

TL;DR: Got promoted twice at a new job after a week, including a raise and taking over as manager.

What are some of your work success stories? Did you get a promotion, or achieve something you thought was impossible? Share your stories!

TITLE: Is there a non-creepy way for me [26M] to approach her [24F] at work?

POST: Hi there, I'll try to keep it short.

There is a girl who works at my go-to grocery store who I would like to get to know better. She really brighten's up my day when I go there and I'm absolutley stunned by her everytime I go there. I know it's hard to approach people at work, but the last thing I will do is creep outside the store until she heads home - HELL NO.

I've been thinking of a way to approach her but everything seems kind of creepy, like just going up to her out of the blue and telling her that I think she's cute and that I would like to get to know her better. Is there a smoother way of doing this?

I know nothing about her except for her Name and her Age. But something tells me that I would like to get to know her more. I've never done nor felt the urge to approach somebody outside of a bar.

Thanks!

TL;DR: I want to get to know a girl at my grocery store better, but I don't want to come off as creepy. Is there a non-creepy way to approach her?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey, OP! I think you're on the right track by wanting to approach her in a non-creepy way. Here's a suggestion: try striking up a conversation about something you both have in common, like a favorite food or a recent event. You could say something like, 'Hey, I love your scarf/shirt/accessory, where did you get it?' or 'I saw that new movie/TV show, what did you think of it?' This way, you're showing interest in her as a person, not just her physical appearance. Just be respectful, listen actively, and don't be pushy. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's great that you're thinking about how to approach her in a respectful way. Here's another suggestion: try to find a way to 'accidentally' run into her outside of work. Maybe you could ask a coworker if they know her and if she's free to grab coffee or lunch sometime. This way, you're not putting her on the spot or making her feel uncomfortable. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where things go. Good luck!"
3. **u/creepy_dude**: "Dude, I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed in your approach. You're thinking about how to 'accidentally' run into her outside of work? That's still kinda creepy, bro. Just be honest and ask her out on a date. If she says no, then you know where you stand. If she says yes, then you can start building a relationship. Just remember, respect her boundaries and don't be pushy. Good luck, bro!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'll try the 'accidentally' running into her outside of work approach, but I'll make sure to be respectful and not pushy. I don't want to come off as creepy, and I appreciate your help. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!"

TITLE: I [24,f] want to be friends with my best friend from HS [m, 24], but don't know how to without leading him on.

POST: My friend traveled around the world in the 6 years since HS and we didn't talk much. He recently moved back to our hometown, which gave us the opportunity to hang out this weekend over the holiday. Before I saw him in person we had started texting a bit. It was pretty harmless, but it is clear that he still as feelings for me. When we hung out this weekend it was a bit awkward. I'm not sure if that's because he's not as into me as he thought (I suspect he held onto strong feelings form HS that may or may not hold now) or maybe it was uncomfortable because he does still have feelings for me. Maybe it's something else...?

So now I'm unsure about how about to handle this. I'd like to continue talking to him, but I also don't want to give him false hope. If it's possible, how do I nurture a friendship without leading him on? Do I let him be the first to call or text? If he cares about me it seems shitty to never initiate contact, but then again this may make him feel false hope... Is this even possible?

I should also note a couple things. There is another female in his life, but she is in another state and they're not in a committed relationship. Also, my partner of 7 years [m, 24] knows that we've been talking and that I hung out with him over break. He is totally find with me talking and hanging out with him.

TL;DR: I want to be friends with my HS best friend, but I don't know how to do it without leading him on. He still has feelings for me, and I don't want to give him false hope. How do I nurture a friendship without leading him on?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's great that you're thinking about this and wanting to be honest with him. It's better to be upfront and clear about your intentions than to lead him on. Maybe you could have a conversation with him about how you feel and what you're looking for in a friendship? It might be a bit awkward, but it's better to be honest than to leave him wondering."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your partner's feelings too. It's not selfish to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries, but it's also important to be considerate of others. Maybe you could talk to your partner about how you're feeling and get his input on how to approach the situation?"
* "I think it's important to remember that you can't control how someone else feels, but you can control how you react to those feelings. If he still has feelings for you, that's okay. You can still be friends with him and be respectful of his feelings, even if you don't feel the same way. Maybe you could focus on building a friendship that's based on mutual respect and trust, rather than romantic feelings?"
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to think about this and consider your feelings. It's not always easy to navigate these kinds of situations, but it's better to be honest and upfront than to lead someone on. Maybe you could try to have a conversation with him about how you feel and what you're looking for in a friendship? It might be a bit awkward, but it's better to be honest than to leave him wondering."
* "I think it's important to remember that you're not obligated to be friends with someone just because you went to high school together. You have the right to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries, and if that means not being friends with him, that's okay. Maybe you could try to have a conversation with him about how you feel and see where it goes from there?"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I think you're all right, it's better to be honest and upfront about my feelings and intentions. I'll try to have a conversation with him about how I feel and what I'm looking for in a friendship. I appreciate your advice and support. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!"

TITLE: Me [24F] with my bf [24 M] 3 years, Am I wrong to be confused at why he didnt walk the dog?

POST: MY bf of 3 years are going through a timeoff, my intentions was for me to decide if I wanted to leave or stay. We are 5 days since he moved out. Today he offers to walk the dog while I'm at work. I told him he didnt need to, he insisted.   

So i've walked the dog at 9 am. He comes over at 3 in the afternoon, and instead of walking the dog right away he stays plays with the dog for a bit and plays computer games for 2 hours. 
He only takes the dog for a walk at close to 6 pm and only for 10 mins.   

So I asked im Why did'nt he take the dog to pee right away. He said lazy, it was hot, he played with the dog. He says im not appreciative at all that he made all this effort. I said I dont understand why you let the dog wait 8 hours to pee when you were there earlier. 

He starts saying im domineering, says fuck a lot, tells me i have to always do things my way. Tells me he doesnt deserve this treatment. If I want to do things my way,I should do it myself.

TL;DR: My bf of 3 years moved out for a time off, I'm deciding if I want to stay or leave. He offers to walk the dog, but instead of doing it right away, he plays with the dog and plays computer games for 2 hours before taking the dog for a 10-minute walk. I'm confused and frustrated.

COMMENT 1:
OP, I think you're being reasonable to be frustrated. It sounds like your bf is not taking your concerns seriously and is instead deflecting and blaming you. The fact that he's saying you're domineering and that he doesn't deserve this treatment is a classic gaslighting tactic. It's not about the dog, it's about his inability to take responsibility for his actions and his lack of empathy.

COMMENT 2:
I think you're being a bit too hard on him. Maybe he was just having a bad day and didn't realize the dog needed to pee that badly. It's not like he intentionally neglected the dog. And yeah, maybe he was feeling a bit lazy, but who hasn't had a lazy day?

COMMENT 3:
OP, I'm with comment 1. It sounds like your bf is trying to manipulate you and make you feel guilty for being upset. The fact that he's saying you're domineering and that he doesn't deserve this treatment is a clear sign of emotional abuse. You deserve better than someone who is going to make you feel bad for expressing your feelings and concerns.

COMMENT 4:
I think you're being a bit too sensitive. It's just a dog, it's not the end of the world. Maybe your bf was just trying to have a little fun and relax after a long day. And yeah, maybe he didn't take the dog out right away, but it's not like he intentionally neglected it.

COMMENT 5:
OP, I think you're being reasonable to be upset. It's not just about the dog, it's about the lack of communication and empathy from your bf. It sounds like he's not taking your concerns seriously and is instead trying to shift the blame onto you. You deserve someone who is going to listen to you and work with you to find a solution. If your bf is not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship.

TITLE: Is it weird to find it hard to give sympathy?

POST: Kind of feeling like a psychopath here...A house burnt down in my town killing all but one survivor. I feel absolutely horrible for all involved but people in his neighborhood who saw the fire happening but aren't particularly close with the family, are up in arms, hysterical, etc. I look at them kind of wtf? They weren't primarily involved and I think it's very selfish of them to be so...affected? by something that doesn't directly have an impact on them. I understand they're upset naturally, but I feel they should be focusing on helping rather than crying. So am I some weird monster who can't feel empathy?

TL;DR: I'm struggling to feel sympathy for people who are upset about a house fire that killed most of the family, but didn't directly affect them. I think they should be focusing on helping rather than crying. Am I a monster?

This post is a great example of the complexities of human emotions and the challenges of navigating social expectations around empathy and sympathy. The author is struggling to understand why they don't feel the same level of emotional response as others around them, and is seeking validation or reassurance that their feelings are normal.

The post has sparked a lively discussion, with many commenters sharing their own experiences and perspectives on empathy and sympathy. Some people have shared stories of times when they felt overwhelmed by the emotions of others, while others have talked about the importance of acknowledging and validating the feelings of those around them.

One common theme that has emerged is the idea that empathy is not always a natural or automatic response, and that it can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and social norms. Many commenters have emphasized the importance of understanding and respecting the emotional responses of others, even if they don't align with our own.

The post has also sparked some interesting discussions about the role of social media in shaping our emotional responses and expectations around empathy and sympathy. Some people have noted that social media can create a sense of emotional contagion, where we feel compelled to respond to the emotions of others in order to appear empathetic or caring. Others have argued that social media can also create a sense of emotional numbness, where we become desensitized to the emotions of others due to the constant stream of information and stimuli.

Overall, this post has sparked a thought-provoking and nuanced discussion about the complexities of human emotions and the challenges of navigating social expectations around empathy and sympathy. It's a great example of the value of sharing our thoughts and feelings with others, and of seeking out diverse perspectives and insights in order to deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

TITLE: Waiting on job offer after interview, need advice

POST: Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am having a bit of an anxiety fit over my current situation. If there is a more appropriate sub, please direct me to it.

I recently graduated from a specialized technical program and since graduating have had a ridiculous number of job offers and interview requests. I have actually turned down a number of interviews. 

I had a job lined up several months ago, but it was honestly not something I was very enthusiastic about, I only took the offer because they were the first to contact me and I was not sure what the job market in my field was like. We'll call then company A.

Long story short, I interviewed with another company last week, let's call them company B, and they exceeded all expectations and are basically a dream come true. They paid for my flight to their facility for the interview, put me up in a hotel and paid for a rental car. I had also previously turned in my notice with my current employer at the time, because company A, which I had already accepted an offer from, had expected me to start this coming week. I left the interview with company B feeling confident but without any offer in hand. Fast forward to today, I have notified company A that I won't be able to start with them and so am officially unemployed and awaiting some word from company B.

Am I insane to expect that company B is going to make some kind of offer? Should I be scrambling to find something solid? I have enough funds to keep me going for a few months if absolutely necessary.

To add some clarification, this is completely out of character for me, I have never left an employer without having a guaranteed job lined up already. I have no experience in this field but have a good amount of general management experience.

TL;DR: Had a job lined up with company A, but turned it down to interview with company B, which I really want to work for. Company B has not made an offer yet, and I'm feeling anxious about my situation. Should I be expecting an offer or should I start looking elsewhere?

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm glad you're being honest about your anxiety. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you're waiting on a job offer.

Firstly, it's great that you turned down the offer with company A. It takes a lot of guts to do that, especially when you've already given notice.

As for company B, it's understandable that you're feeling anxious. However, it's important to remember that they may not have made an offer yet because they're still processing your application or because they're waiting for other candidates to make a decision.

I would suggest sending a polite follow-up email to company B, expressing your interest in the position and asking if there's any update on the status of your application. This will show that you're still interested in the role and willing to wait for the right opportunity.

In the meantime, it's a good idea to keep your options open and continue to apply to other jobs that align with your skills and interests. This will give you a sense of security and help you feel more in control of your situation.

Remember, it's okay to take your time and wait for the right opportunity. Don't rush into anything that doesn't feel right for you.

COMMENT 2:
I completely understand where you're coming from, OP. I've been in a similar situation before, and it's tough to wait for a job offer.

Firstly, it's great that you're being proactive and sending a follow-up email to company B. This shows that you're still interested in the role and willing to wait for the right opportunity.

In terms of your anxiety, I would suggest taking some time to focus on yourself and your well-being. Practice some relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to help manage your stress levels.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to take your time and wait for the right opportunity. Don't rush into anything that doesn't feel right for you. Take your time, and when the right opportunity comes along, you'll know it.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people have been in your shoes before, and they've come out the other side with a great job and a sense of fulfillment.

TITLE: Reddit, my suite at college just got busted for a small party. I was in my room doing work not drinking, should I be reprimanded?

POST: There were approximately 15 people in the suite playing *water* pong and drinking a few beers, doing shots, playing music. All but 1 was underage. 

I was in my room doing work because I am a loser and have 3 tests on Monday to study for. 

The RA came in and said party's over and told them to dump the beer, wrote down everyones names, and told everyone who didn't live there to get out. 

She was REALLY nice about it and kept saying that we were all being really cooperative and polite and that would go on the report. 

There was a friend of ours who is an RA there who had just stopped by and got fucked by the timing. There was a girl who will probably get kicked off a sports team, and there was the guy who was 21 who could be in trouble for drinking with minors.
This is all of our first offense.

I talked to the RA personally and she said that if my roommates vouch for me not drinking and not being involved that will help my case, but I would probably get in trouble for just plain having knowledge of the party. But technically I never came out of the room for the one and a half hour that the party was going on for.

TL;DR: Suite party busted, I was in my room doing work, should I be reprimanded?

---

This post is a great example of a Reddit user seeking advice on a situation they are unsure about. The user is worried about getting in trouble for having knowledge of the party, even though they didn't participate or encourage it. The post is well-written and provides all the necessary details, making it easy for readers to understand the situation.

The post also raises interesting questions about responsibility and accountability. Should the user be held responsible for knowing about the party, even if they didn't participate? Is it fair to punish someone for simply being aware of an event that was happening in their suite?

The comments on this post are also interesting, with many users sharing their own experiences with similar situations. Some users argue that the user should be held responsible for knowing about the party, while others believe that the user should not be punished since they didn't participate or encourage the party. The comments also raise questions about the role of RAs and the consequences of underage drinking.

Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be used to seek advice and discuss complex issues. The post is well-written, and the comments provide a range of perspectives and insights on the situation.

TITLE: I need your help - met a 94 y/o woman who is awesome! but she does not have a shower!

POST: I was at the grocery doing some trading and while waiting for a friend started some idle conversation with an elderly lady. (my friend thought I had already gone, so we talked for a bit). Her parents lived till they were 105 - both of them! She is still kicking so much ass at life- She cooks her own meals, dresses her self, has a great short term and long term memory, still opens the window to yell at the punk kids w/ their loud music. This 94 y/o gal has been through depressions, wars, technological revolutions. she is so happy and sharp, so being a young man I asked her a few questions (how was your teens, travel, work,) one of which was "is there anything you miss" and she said well taking a shower. WTF! "I have a shower but dut to my arthritis I cant get my legs over the side of the tub, so I just use a warsh cloth... you get use to it after a few years" (she didn't smell so I guess she did a good job of it)... but this made me really sad. I talked to a guy who said if I can find out who owns the building he would call him and make the shower thing happen (walk in shower w/chair and hand rails etc). He knows most every one in town and can call in some favors. so thats where I intend to start - and if the landlord is a slum lord then I'll will find a way to acquire a walk in shower and install it myself! Can you help me find out who owns these apts? I've looked and asked around and... nothing. its gotta be public info some wheres... right?

TL;DR: Met a 94 y/o woman who is awesome, but she doesn't have a shower due to arthritis. I want to help her get a walk-in shower installed. Can you help me find out who owns the building?

TITLE: [15, almost 16/F] My boyfriend [17/M] and I need to find out how to sleep together in a bed.

POST: First off, I want to say that yeah, we're kinda young but we take naps together a lot. We're a lazy couple.

We're both used to sleeping on our stomachs or sides, but I'm finding it hard to find one position that works best. I hug things in my sleep, so spooning with him in the back doesn't really work unless I have an extra pillow, and we don't. However, when I'm in the back, I can't get my bottom arm under him without hurting his side (I have bony arms.) Us facing each other works for a bit, with him hugging me and me holding my arms between his and my chest, but he likes to surround me and I find myself running out of air. I can't think of any other position to sleep in except me lying on his chest, but last time we did that, we both got stomach aches. 

I'm hoping that this will help us out once he gets his own place and I start to spend the night there. If we're having troubles napping, I can only imagine how we're going to pull off sleep through the the whole night as well.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Young couple having trouble finding a comfortable sleeping position in bed, especially with one partner having bony arms and the other preferring to surround them. Seeking advice on how to sleep together comfortably.

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're thinking about this ahead of time! It's great that you're considering your partner's comfort and needs. Have you tried using a body pillow? They can help support your body and provide a sense of security while also giving you more flexibility in terms of positioning. Additionally, you might consider talking to your partner about what he likes and dislikes about the way you sleep together. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important when it comes to something as intimate as sleep."
2. **u/sleepyhead22**: "I'm a side sleeper and my partner is a back sleeper, and we've found that the key is to find a compromise. We use a queen-sized bed with a lot of pillows, and we've learned to adjust our positions to accommodate each other. For example, I'll sleep on my side with a pillow between my knees, and my partner will sleep on his back with a pillow under his knees. It's all about finding a position that works for both of you. You might also consider using a mattress topper or a memory foam mattress, as these can help reduce pressure points and make it easier to sleep together."
3. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're thinking about this and wanting to find a solution that works for both of you. It's not uncommon for couples to have different sleep preferences, and it's all about finding a compromise that works for both of you. Have you considered talking to your partner about what he likes and dislikes about the way you sleep together? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your needs and desires. Additionally, you might consider trying out different positions and seeing what works best for both of you.

For example, I'll sleep on my stomach with a pillow under my hips, and my partner will sleep on his side with a pillow between his knees. It's all about finding a position that works for both of you.

TITLE: Me 18M and 17F girlfriend. Afraid to lose virginity. How can I help her not too freak out?

POST: I've been dating my girlfriend for eight months now and the topic of sex has come up quite a bit recently. She is really afraid of getting pregnant and she doesn't want to have sex yet. I'm not trying to convince her or push her or anything, I want her to be 100% comfortable when it happens. 
She is really afraid that she is going to freak out before it happens, or during. She says that it will happen and I've seen little freakouts from her if I get too close to her. I just really want to know how I can help her not freak out, or if she does, how to calm her down enough to continue and be comfortable.

Here's some background info if it helps.
 Her parents sheltered her from sex completely telling her it was bad and making it seem weird and out of place by not talking about it.

I've been helping her get over the "weirdness" of the sexual things we do and it is really hard, but we get by.

TL;DR: 18M and 17F girlfriend, afraid to lose virginity, how can I help her not freak out?

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "It's amazing that you're taking the time to understand and support her concerns. It's not uncommon for people who were sheltered from sex to have a lot of anxiety around it. Here are a few suggestions: 1) Have an open and honest conversation with her about what she's worried about. Ask her what specifically is making her anxious and listen to her concerns. 2) Educate her about sex and sexuality in a way that's comfortable for her. You can find plenty of resources online that are written for teenagers and are super informative. 3) Encourage her to express her feelings and worries to you. Let her know that you're there to support her and that you're not going anywhere. 4) Consider taking things slow and building up to sex. This can help her feel more comfortable and in control. 5) Remind her that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're in this together. You're not going to judge her or pressure her into doing something she's not comfortable with."

TITLE: How do you respectfully flirt with a woman?

POST: Lately I have seen a lot of posts about women getting creeped out by guys flirting with them, taking "no" to mean "yes" and similar things. I agree that women should feel more comfortable with rejecting advances, and all around should have way more freedom in our society to be individuals.

Now, I want to try and be a bit more flirtatious, my best friend who is just naturally friendly, is mock flirtatious with pretty much every guy and girl, and pretty much everyone loves him.

I'm not saying I want to try and be him. But I know that I pretty much never flirt because I feel like if I flirt at all or give any kind of compliment, it could be taken as "verbal abuse". For example, I say "Hey so and so, I love your hair, it looks really good". There was one time I actually just genuinely liked how a girl's hair looked, it was a unique color, and wanted to compliment her on it. I asked a female friend of mine who was nearby if it would be okay if I told the girl, and my friend says it would have been creepy.

TL;DR: I want to learn how to flirt respectfully with women, without being creepy or making them feel uncomfortable. How do you guys do it?

COMMENTS:

1. "I think the key is to be genuine and respectful. If you're just trying to get someone's attention for the sake of it, it's going to come across as insincere. But if you're actually interested in getting to know someone, and you're willing to listen to them and have a conversation, that's a different story. Just be yourself, and don't be afraid to show your interest in a respectful way."
2. "I think it's also important to remember that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels. What might be okay for one person might not be okay for another. So it's always a good idea to ask someone if they're comfortable with the level of flirting you're doing, and to respect their boundaries if they say no."
3. "I've found that the best way to flirt is to be confident and genuine. If you're feeling nervous or unsure of yourself, it's going to come across as insincere. But if you're feeling good about yourself and you're being genuine, that's a different story. Just be yourself, and don't be afraid to show your interest in a respectful way."
4. "I think it's also important to remember that flirting is a two-way street. If someone is not interested in you, it's okay to respect their boundaries and move on. Don't take it personally, and don't keep trying to get someone's attention if they're not interested."
5. "I've found that the best way to flirt is to be yourself, and to be respectful of the other person's boundaries. If you're feeling nervous or unsure of yourself, it's okay to take a step back and reassess the situation. Don't be afraid to ask someone if they're comfortable with the level of flirting you're doing, and respect their boundaries if they say no."

Overall, the comments suggest that the key to respectfully flirting with a woman is to be genuine, respectful, and confident. It's also important to remember that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels, and to respect those boundaries if someone says no. Flirting should be a two-way street, and if someone is not interested, it's okay to respect their boundaries and move on. The comments also suggest that it's okay to ask someone if they're comfortable with the level of flirting you're doing, and to be willing to reassess the situation if you're feeling nervous or unsure of yourself.

TITLE: [19f]Keeping an innocent (but somewhat significant) piece of information from my boyfriend of a few months [21m]...

POST: Honestly, I'm not sure how significant this piece of information is in the context of our relationship.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a few months now, and he doesn't know that the drunken dance-floor makeout we had a little over a year ago, the first time we met, was my first kiss.

I've kissed plenty of other people since then, so it's not like he's the only person I've ever kissed. I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. 

Basically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.

Should I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my "first" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. 

I'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer. The topic of first kisses may come up at some point before then, though.

TL;DR: Should I tell my boyfriend that he was my first kiss, or keep it to myself? Would he find it funny or weird?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, I think it's not a big deal to keep it to yourself. It's not like it's a huge secret or something that's going to change the course of your relationship. If he finds out, he might be a little surprised, but it's not like you're hiding something huge from him."
* "I think you should tell him. It's a funny coincidence, and it could be a great conversation starter. Just be prepared for him to be a little surprised or weirded out, and try to approach the conversation in a lighthearted way."
* "I don't think it's a big deal to keep it to yourself, but if you do decide to tell him, make sure you're prepared for him to potentially feel a little weird about it. He might feel like he's been 'claimed' or something, which could be awkward."
* "I think you should wait until you've known each other for longer. Right now, you're still getting to know each other and figuring out your relationship. There's no need to bring up something that might make things a little awkward or complicated. Just enjoy the relationship for now and see where it goes."
* "I think it's a little weird that you're considering not telling him at all. If you're in a relationship, you should be honest with each other. It's not like you're hiding something huge, but it's still important to be truthful. Just be prepared for him to be a little surprised or weirded out, and try to approach the conversation in a lighthearted way."

TITLE: People who have posted about issues regarding SO's past: do you ever get over it?

POST: From the very beginning of our relationship a year ago, bf [25] was uncomfortable with my [23] sexual/dating history.  Complete double standards.  I've done nothing he hasn't, and he's been with a lot more people.  But he's always recognized that he's being irrational and that it's something he needs to get over.  But we don't know what to do to help him get over this, and whenever we talk about it it only makes it worse.  It's been a year and he insists he still needs more time to even know if it's possible.  At what point do I walk?

TL;DR: SO has been uncomfortable with my past sexual history for a year, despite recognizing it's irrational. We've tried talking about it, but it only makes it worse. At what point do I walk?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that your SO recognizes that his discomfort is irrational, but it's not just about being rational. It's about trust and respect. If he's still struggling with this after a year, it might be worth considering whether he's truly committed to working through his issues or if he's just not willing to accept your past. You deserve someone who can respect and accept you for who you are, past and all." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I'm not saying it's okay to be uncomfortable with your past, but it's also not okay to expect someone to just 'get over it' after a year. It's a process, and it's not something that can be rushed. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation about what he's struggling with and what he needs from you to feel more comfortable. It's possible that he's not even aware of what he's looking for, and that's okay. It's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I think it's time to reevaluate whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. If your SO is still struggling with this after a year, it's likely that it's not just about you, but about his own insecurities and issues. You deserve someone who can accept and love you for who you are, past and all. Don't waste your time on someone who can't do that." (u/strongwomenrock)
* "I think it's worth considering couples therapy to work through this issue. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your feelings. It's not just about 'getting over it,' but about understanding and respecting each other's boundaries and needs." (u/relationshiptherapist)

POST: So. I've been seeing a guy now for a few months. I met him right as I was getting out of a messy relationship that really fucked with my head. But he's made me so happy since I've started seeing him and I can really see a future with him. But we haven't yet talked about where we see this going. We've both said we aren't sleeping with other people, but we haven't yet said whether or not we want to be in a relationship. I'm having trouble bringing up the subject. Mostly because my last relationship ended so badly and it makes me nervous to let someone else in. I'm also worried that our age difference might be too much for him because every once in a while he'll make a joke about how young I am. 

I know that being scared to have this conversation seems stupid and most of you will probably think that I shouldn't be with someone I can't have this conversation with. But I guess I just can't decide if having this talk after only a couple months is rushing into something or if I'm going to sound crazy. I guess I just need a pep talk or something. Any advice is greatly appreciated

TL;DR: 24f dating 32m, having trouble bringing up the status of our relationship after a few months. Worried about age difference and past relationship trauma. Need advice on how to approach the conversation

TITLE: Me [32 M] with my girlfriend [30 F] of 1 1/2 years, found her online dating profile, not sure what to do

POST: I've been seeing this girl for 1 1/2 years, mostly long distance.  Recently found her facebook and while digging around I found an online dating profile with pictures of her.  After confronting her on the phone and skype, she tearfully said her sister made the profile without her knowledge.  But most of the pictures on her profile is not on her FB and the description on the profile sounds uncannily like her.  Like the writing style is like hers.

Honestly, I never thought of her as the type to cheat on me.  But when I read the profile, I didn't have any doubts it's her.  Also, why would her 26 year old sister, married with children, want to create a fake online dating profile with her older sister's photos?  I can't explain it and neither could she.

Never thought this would happen (again) in my life.  You'd think by the time people hit their 30's this shit would stop.  Why do I feel like I'm still in high school.  Fucking relationships suck ass.

Now I'm not sure what to do.  I think I should just dump her and move on.  Having a hard time believing she'd do this, but I'm also having a hard time believing her sister would do this.  I need some advice reddit.

TL;DR: Found girlfriend's online dating profile with pictures of her, she says her sister made it without her knowledge, but the writing style and pictures seem too similar to be a coincidence. Not sure what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Dude, you're not thinking clearly. You're in a relationship, and you're not sure what to do? You need to take a step back and think about what you want. Do you want to stay in this relationship and try to work through this, or do you want to get out and move on? Either way, you need to have a conversation with your girlfriend about this and figure out what's going on."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I would recommend having a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. Ask her to explain why her sister would create a fake online dating profile with her pictures, and why she didn't notice it before. Also, ask her if she's been feeling unhappy or unfulfilled in the relationship, and if there's anything she's been wanting to change. It's possible that there's more to this story than just a sister making a mistake."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not buying it. If her sister made the profile without her knowledge, why did she have to tearfully apologize and explain it? It sounds like she's trying to cover something up. I would say it's time to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether you're really getting the honesty and trust you deserve."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I'm a bit concerned about the sister's involvement in this. If she's married with children, why would she create a fake online dating profile? It's possible that there's more to this story than just a simple mistake. I would recommend having a conversation with your girlfriend's sister to get to the bottom of this and figure out what's going on."
5. **RealTalk**: "Listen, relationships are messy and complicated. Sometimes people do things that hurt each other, and it's not always intentional. If you're feeling unsure about the relationship, it's okay to take some time to think about what you want. But don't make any rash decisions without having a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend. Remember, relationships are about growth and communication, not just about trust and honesty."

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years, have different sleep patterns - says im selfish

POST: I've been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years and we recently bought our own house and moved in at Christmas.

I've always ran on about 6 - 7 hours sleep, and prior to moving in, I'd always do my own thing when I got home.  I'd play games, learn some code until I was tired which was usually until about half 12.  

My girlfriend is always tired and wakes up early for her job, she's usually up at 7 and out of the house by 8.  She goes to bed at 10:30 so gets about 8 - 9 hours sleep a night.

I've been trying to get into this sleep pattern, but I just find myself lying awake at night or being shattered the next day from too much sleep.

I'm wanting to spend some time playing some games, and with most people my age, the only time we get is later at night - hence the reason I was usually playing games from about 10 - 12:30.

Now we're living together, she complains that I either wake her up because she's a light sleeper, and how it's unfair for me to go to bed later because I should be thinking about her.

Personally I think this is wrong to simply demand this, but she's as stubborn as they come, and trying to talk sense into her just results in an argument.  I've tried explaining the above, or using the fact that when she wakes up in the morning, her alarm wakes me up, as does her getting dressed etc so I end up waking up an hour earlier due to her.  

I should add that I work from home in a stressful job, but she uses this as an excuse as to why I should respect her sleeping hours and go to bed at the same time (even if i lie awake for hours).  I can't go to bed later, I can't use my laptop in bed to code, yet she has to have the TV on to go to sleep to (I can't stand this)

I don't really know how else to tackle it, as everything gets turned into me being the bad guy and its all about her

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 5 years and I have different sleep patterns, she wants me to go to bed at 10:30, but I need later to relax and recharge. She says I'm selfish and it's unfair to wake her up. I've tried explaining my side, but she just gets defensive and we end up arguing.

---

**Top comments:**

* "It sounds like you're being reasonable and trying to find a compromise. Maybe you could try setting a compromise sleep schedule, like 11:30 PM, and see how that works for both of you?"
* "I think it's unfair to expect you to change your sleep schedule just because your girlfriend is a light sleeper. You should talk to her about finding ways to make her sleep more soundly, like earplugs or a white noise machine."
* "It's not about being selfish, it's about being an adult and having your own needs and desires. You should communicate with your girlfriend and find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I think you should try to understand where your girlfriend is coming from. She might be feeling stressed or anxious about something and needs the extra sleep. Try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can find a solution that works for both of you."
* "It's not about being selfish, it's about being respectful of each other's needs. You should try to find a compromise that works for both of you, like setting a specific bedtime or finding ways to make your girlfriend feel more comfortable when you're awake."

TITLE: Me [21 M] broken up about break up with girl [21 F]

POST: I have already posted about this girl previously but just for quick background, we have known each other a while, dated for about 4-5 months, although she has had feelings for about a year. A few days ago she ended things with me and I suppose I am writing this more to vent, since I was numb to the break up until today.

For a few weeks before I could tell she was pulling away. She said she felt pressured into being official, and was scared due to a very large amount of outside stress, mainly due to her grandmother being very sick in the hospital for months. About 2 weeks ago we had a large fight, where she was very iffy about making plans for a date and I was annoyed because she had been flakey about dates recently. We talked a few days ago and she said that she had intended to give it time and see where it went but after that fight she suddenly lost feelings.

Being honest, I am devastated. I had fallen hard for this girl and the idea that I had pressured her into things and caused her to lose feelings is a tough pill to swallow. That being said, I doubt there is much I can do to "fix" things and try again, and she is so guilty about hurting me I doubt she would even tell me if she did still have feelings or redeveloped them. Still, any advice, comments, words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Broke up with girl after 4-5 months, she says she lost feelings due to outside stress and a fight we had. I'm devastated and unsure what to do.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear about the break up. It sounds like you two had some real issues that needed to be addressed, but it's still tough to deal with. I think it's great that you're acknowledging that you may have contributed to the problems in the relationship. That takes a lot of self-awareness and maturity.

As for what to do, I think you should focus on taking care of yourself right now. Give yourself time to process your emotions and grieve the loss of the relationship. It's okay to feel sad and angry, but try not to dwell on what could have been or what you could have done differently. Instead, focus on what you can control, like taking care of your physical and emotional health.

Also, try not to put too much pressure on yourself to "fix" things or try to get her back. It's not worth it, and it's not healthy for you. Instead, focus on moving forward and finding ways to grow and learn from this experience. You are strong and capable, and you will get through this.

TITLE: TIFU by letting my 7 year old sister crash her friend's go kart into his dad's porsche.

POST: I'll start off by giving you a little background.  I am 16, and my little sister is 7.  She was bored and wanted to go hang out at her friend's house down the street.  So I took her there.

When we got there, her friend insisted on showing me his new go kart. So I said sure.  We went to his garage, and he showed me his go kart.  I asked if I can try it out and he said sure. I rode it around for about a minute and then got off.

Then my sister asked if she can try it. I was skeptical at first because she's never driven anything like this.  But then I thought, *"It has four wheels. It's not like she's gonna flip it or anything."*

So I told her she can. I showed her all the controls. How to steer, how to go, and how to brake. Then I step away and let her go.

She then proceeded to drive straight into a Porsche. Her friend's dad's Porsche.  Everyone freaked out, and ran inside to tell him.  And to make matters worse, they exaggerated a lot and told him the scratch was ***huge*** and she was going ***super fast*** when she crashed into it.

The dad was super nice about it, but I felt guilty as fuck. I said sorry multiple times. And I told my sister to apologize but she never did.

Then about 20 minutes later as we were leaving, I told my sister to go say thank you for all the snacks they gave her and for being so cool about everything.  But instead of saying thank you, she started crying because she didn't want to go. The crying then turned into screaming and yelling and calling me names.  I finally had to carry her out of there because she refused to leave.  I kept on apologizing as we were leaving.

I've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life.

TL;DR: I let my 7 year old sister drive a go kart and she crashed it into her friend's dad's Porsche.  I felt guilty and embarrassed and now I'm writing this to vent.

TITLE: GF of 5 years probably moving away, wants me to go but I said no.

POST: A little bit of history: I'm 23/m she's 22/f and we have been together on and off for 5-6 years now. This girl is my best friend and I will probably always love her no matter how things end up. She graduates from school in a few months and has this really great chance for a 1yr + internship in Boston, NY, or NJ (we currently live on the western part of the country) and may end up staying out of state beyond the 1yr if she finds a grad school she likes out there. Now the hard thing is that she wants me to move with her to where ever she ends up going and I flat out told her I wasn't comfortable with that **at all!** I don't even feel comfortable with moving in with her right now let alone leaving everything else behind to move across the country. I told her to go if she gets the opportunity because I'll be damned if I'm the thing to hold her back. The hard part about this is that we already tried the long distance thing at the beginning of her schooling 4 years ago and ended up breaking up for the first year that she was gone. She wants to go and would be willing to try the long distance thing again and keeps asking about my thoughts on doing LDR again. She also wants to try even though she seem hopeful it would work based on past experience and quite frankly I don't even want to try a LDR again (horrible shit). Every time she brings it up she basically leaves the decision on me about what we are going to do and I don't know what to do Reddit. Every time I think about it, something in me can't help but start counting down to the (final) end of our relationship even though I don't want it to end. Any advice? (sorry for the giant wall of text) and I will be happy to clarify anything if need be. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: GF of 5 years wants me to move with her to the east coast for an internship, I said no, now she's asking about trying long distance again, and I'm unsure what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're being very reasonable. You've already tried long distance and it didn't work out, and you're not comfortable with moving across the country. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires in a relationship. You can't force someone to stay or move with you, and it's not fair to expect them to do so. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and boundaries. It's possible that she'll understand and respect your decision, even if it means the end of your relationship."
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "I think you're being very clear and direct about your boundaries, and that's great. However, it's also important to consider your girlfriend's feelings and perspective. She's been with you for 5 years, and this is a big opportunity for her. You could try to have a conversation with her about what's driving her desire to move, and what she hopes to get out of this experience. It's possible that there are things you can do to support her, even if you're not willing to move with her. For example, you could offer to visit her regularly, or help her find a place to live in the new location. By showing that you're willing to support her, even if you're not willing to move with her, you may be able to find a compromise that works for both of you."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being very reasonable, but I also think you need to consider the possibility that your girlfriend may not be willing to accept your decision. She's been with you for 5 years, and she's invested a lot in this relationship. She may feel like you're abandoning her or not supporting her, even if you're just being honest about your own needs and desires. You need to be prepared for the possibility that she may get upset or angry, and you need to be clear about your boundaries and what you're willing to compromise on. It's also important to remember that you can't control how others react to your decisions, but you can control how you react to theirs. Try to stay calm and assertive, and don't be afraid to walk away if the relationship becomes toxic or unhealthy."

TITLE: TIFU and flooded my bathroom

POST: This happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the mood for a hot, foamy bath. I go into the bathroom, hop into the tub, add some bath salts (and no, I'm not craving for human flesh) and some of that thing that produces foam (I'm not English, sorry!) and lay on my back, eyes closed.

I should mention by now that our drain plug is chipped and lets water leak from the tub into the drain, so I usually take it out and put a plastic bag. It worked like a charm. Until today.

After 2-3 minutes, I hear bubbles in the secondary drain (the one on the floor made to prevent floods. Ironic, huh?) and realize that the water was at half the original level.

No biggie. I reach for the plastic bag to adjust it and realize that it'a gone. I look to the bathroom floor only to see it entirely flooded. The plastic bag was sucked into the drain and clogged it. By now, the tub was empty. I jumped out and ran to grab some towels. To my relief, the bag was flushed down and the water started going down the drain.

But I didn't finish bathing. And guess what? No hot water left. After a manly cold bath, I get out, dry myself and prepare for the worst. 

My house has a pretty weird structure. It's made by two buildings. One hosts the bedrooms and living-room, and the other hosts the kitchen and bathroom. They are connected, but there is no door between. From one to the other is a 10 meter walk. And I had to walk slowly since the ground was frozen, and it was cold as fuck outside. 

Now you may be wondering why I bathed in cold water instead of showering tomorrow morning. It's because my overly-protective parents forbid me from bathing/showering immediately before going out to prevent me from catching a cold.

TL;DR: I flooded my bathroom, clogged the drain, and had to take a cold bath because of my parents' rules. I'm now shivering and regretting my decision.

EDITS:

* Added the part about the bath salts and the foam-producing thing
* Added the part about the secondary drain and the plastic bag
* Added the part about the weird structure of my house
* Added the part about my parents' rules

TITLE: Reddit, BT is trying to charge my family £140 because the phone+hub they have given to us has failed. it has never worked from the day we have had it, and we pay line rental fee's for the phone but can't use it.

POST: BT provided us with a "homehub" (router) which has a built in phone. The phone has never worked, and yet we can only use that phone to get the 'free' calls that we pay for. Because it doesn't work it means we have to use a second phone, which means we receive very high charges.

My father called BT support up and asked them if they could repair it and, failing that, replace it, because the damage is nothing to do with us, and any and all filters on the phone have been checked and replaced, yet still nothing. They said "we will repair the phone happily, just pay us £140 and we will send out an engineer"

Obviously we don't want this, we would rather just have a new hub, i mean it has to be cheaper for both sides for them to just replace it? it must cost them what, £40 to produce?

anyway, down to the point, they aren't budging, is there anything anyone could suggest we do to make the robbing bastards give us what we pay (heavily) for?

TL;DR: BT is trying to charge us £140 to repair a faulty phone that has never worked, and we pay line rental fees for it. We want a new hub, not a repair.

This post is an example of a common issue in the UK, where customers are being charged for repairs or replacements of faulty equipment by telecommunications companies. The customer is frustrated and feels that the company is being unreasonable in their demands.

The post is seeking advice from the Reddit community on how to resolve the issue. The customer is looking for suggestions on how to negotiate with BT and get a new hub instead of paying for a repair.

The post is well-written and provides all the necessary information, including the details of the issue, the customer's attempts to resolve it, and the desired outcome. The tone is polite and respectful, but also frustrated and annoyed.

The post has received many comments and suggestions from the Reddit community, including advice on how to negotiate with BT, how to escalate the issue to a higher level of support, and how to report the issue to the relevant regulatory bodies. The post has also received some negative comments, but overall, the community has been supportive and helpful.

TITLE: TIFU by trusting a fart.

POST: This just happened. I don't write very well, so please excuse my grammar. 

We'll start off with my morning. I wake up late for work. Had to be at work for 0730, woke up at 0710. I work for an ambulance service as an EMT and I am currently in paramedic school doing clinicals every other day I'm not working a 24 hour shifts on the boo boo bus. So I'm rushing around trying to get my uniform together when I fell a dart brewing. Ok seems innocent enough. No. It was a bubble of doom. I knew instantly as it was coming out that it was too late and I had just destroyed a nice fresh pair of boxers. So the boxers get thrown away and now I'm wasting even more time sitting on the toilet. My bowels are doing back flips and now I'm even more late for work. So I finish as fast I could then frantically find a new pair boxers and finish getting my shit together and get out the door for a 20 min drive to work. 

When I get to work I remembered I keep a bottle of pepto bismol in my box. Thinking it would help settle my stomachs and colon I decide to take some. Well that was possibly the worst idea I could of had st the time. Someone had decided to play a joke on me and put hot sauce in my medicine. Instant burning all the way down. My stomach is now doing front flips and back flips and side flips and any other flip you could possible image. Now I need to vomit. Made it in time to the bathroom luckily. That pepto was the only thing I had in my stomach and it felt like I was spewing hell fire. Now I like some spice here and there but this was hot hot. Not a flavor hot. So now I feel even worse and I just started my 24 hour shift. Yay.

TL;DR: I trusted a fart and it led to a series of unfortunate events, including a destroyed pair of boxers, a stomach full of hot sauce, and a very long and miserable 24 hour shift.

TITLE: Drama with my BF's roommates

POST: My boyfriend lives with four other guys, one of whom he shares a room, Max. A few days ago, we got into a heated argument that almost resulted in us breaking up. We didn't because most of the issues we have  are because of Max, a 22 year old stoner who spends the majority of his day playing video games. Max does not have a job, go to class, and lives off of his parents money, most of which goes to weed and eating out. Because of Max's influence, my boyfriend has started gaming and smoking more. At Max's request, I've stopped coming over as much and doing certain things that bother him, such as coming in from the backdoor, knocking on the window to have someone unlock the door, bringing over extra changes of clothes, etc. All of these requests are reasonable enough but they have brought stress onto my relationship nonetheless. Other than that, we get along OK.

While my boyfriend and I were fighting, I called Max "a useless piece of shit." It was unnecessary and I certainly regret it, but it was honest. However, though we were outside, one of my boyfriend's other roommates overheard when he came to smoke a cigarette and told Max what I said. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but obviously that's what he would like me to do.

So here's my issue: I don't mind apologizing to Max but I feel like the informant roommate shouldn't have said anything to Max in the first place. My words weren't meant for other people and the other roommate knows that Max and I get along for the most part. Do I have a right to be angry at the other roommate?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's roommate Max is a 22 year old stoner who lives off his parents' money and influences my boyfriend to game and smoke more. I called Max a "useless piece of shit" during an argument with my boyfriend, but I regret it. Now my boyfriend's roommate overheard and told Max, and my boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but I feel like I should. I'm angry at the other roommate for telling Max, and I'm not sure if I should apologize.

---

This post is a great example of how drama can arise in relationships, even when it's not directly related to the couple themselves. The OP's frustration with Max's lifestyle and influence on her boyfriend has created tension in their relationship, and the argument with her boyfriend has brought up feelings of regret and anger.

The question of whether the OP has a right to be angry at the other roommate is a good one. While the roommate may have been trying to do the right thing by telling Max about the argument, they also overheard a private conversation and chose to share it with someone else. This could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since the OP and Max generally get along.

The OP's dilemma is whether to apologize to Max, and if so, whether she should do it because her boyfriend wants her to or because she genuinely feels remorse for her words. This is a classic example of a "should I apologize" conundrum, where the OP is torn between her own feelings and the expectations of others.

The comments on this post are likely to be filled with advice and opinions on whether the OP should apologize to Max, how she should handle the situation with her boyfriend, and whether she has a right to be angry at the other roommate. The post also raises questions about the influence of others on our relationships and how we navigate conflicts and apologies in our personal lives.

TITLE: I (22 M) like everything about this woman (23 F) but her weight.

POST: Backstory: I'm originally from Maryland, but I just came back from doing a summer internship in Boston. In late July, I met this woman from OKC.. we were sexting pics within a couple days of first contact and at first I thought all this was going to be was a hookup because of the way things started. When I first saw her in real life she ended up being a lot bigger than I anticipated and I quickly noted that she was not my ideal body type but I still enjoyed the sex.

After sex, we just laid on my bed and talked for about 3-4 hours. We found that we had a lot in common and I realized that I actually enjoyed her company. She even bought me Chipotle afterwards. We decided we wanted to keep seeing each other, even though we both knew that I had to go back home to Maryland soon to finish up my last year of school. 

Fast forward to last week (Aug 24), she ends up coming down to visit me for the week at my parents' place in Maryland (where I'm staying for the next 2 semesters). She's met my parents and sister.

Basically, I find that I really enjoy her company, her personality, the way she supports me in my hobbies/aspirations.. everything except her body type. We have TONS of sex (2-3 times a day) but one time I couldn't finish and she asked if I thought she was unattractive and honestly I don't really find her body attractive but I think she has a gorgeous face. Of course I didn't tell her this I just said that I think she is beautiful. 

I like everything about this woman except her weight. She is about 5'6 and 155 and I am that same weight but I am 5'9. Sometimes I feel like I'm settling in the looks department (is this shallow?) because up until this point in my life I've only dated skinny/athletic women. Am I just scared about what my friends will think about her weight? 

I don't want to just cut her off since I really do like her but her weight bothers me slightly. What should I do?

TL;DR: I met a woman who I really like, but she's overweight. I'm torn between my attraction to her and my discomfort with her weight. I don't know if I'm being shallow or if I'm just scared of what my friends will think.

---

**Community Response:**

The community responds with a mix of empathy, frustration, and advice. Some users express understanding that it's natural to have preferences, but others condemn the OP's shallow thinking and encourage him to reevaluate his priorities.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Dude, you're 22 and you're already worried about what your friends think? Grow up. If you're not comfortable with her weight, then maybe you're not ready for a serious relationship. You need to figure out what's more important to you: your own insecurities or the person you're with."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I understand that you're struggling with this, but let me tell you something: weight is not a reflection of a person's worth. Your friends will come around once they get to know her as a person. You need to focus on building a connection with her, not judging her based on her appearance."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, OP. You're being shallow. You're attracted to her personality, but you're not willing to accept her for who she is, flaws and all. If you can't see past her weight, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship."
4. **u/realistic_rachel**: "I think you're being unfair to yourself and to her. You're saying you like everything about her except her weight, but that's not true. You're attracted to her, but you're not willing to work on your own insecurities. Maybe take some time to reflect on why you're so fixated on her weight and what that says about your own self-worth."

**Conclusion:**

The community's response highlights the complexities of attraction, relationships, and self-awareness. While some users acknowledge the OP's struggle, others condemn his shallow thinking and encourage him to reevaluate his priorities. Ultimately, the OP must confront his own insecurities and decide whether he's willing to work on his own biases or risk losing a potentially great connection with someone he cares about.

TITLE: Looking for a Good Cat Feeder/Toy

POST: Hey everyone!  I need some help.  Me and my girlfriend have two cats who have gotten a little food obsessed.  They were both kinda fat at one point so we, with the advice of our vet, put them on a diet of organic wet food (we use Prowl, the dehydrated stuff that you add water to).

Well, they're getting a little obnoxious now.  We used to keep their food on top of the fridge, but once they went on a diet they figured out how to climb up on top of the fridge, knocked the box over and ate like a half a box of dehydrated cat food.  So, we moved it to our laundry room, on top of the washer/dryer combo.  If we ever left the door cracked they were up there again, tearing into the box.  The final straw came this weekend when we had left the door closed but they got it anyway!  How you ask?  Well we live in a loft, and they actually climbed on top of the bathroom (there's like four feet between the bathroom ceiling and the loft ceiling) found their way in the laundry room through the roof of the closet and tore open the box of food.

I think partly they need something to do!  We both work a lot and I take care of my grandma on the weekends so they're home alone a lot.  I want one of those toys that you can put treats in and they have to play with it to get them out.  I've tried Kong stuff, and while they love to play with the "snowman ball" they don't seem interested in/able to get out food I put in it (it came with some kind of salmon paste).  I need a good toy that will let a little food out at a time to keep their attention away from raiding the food box and keep them entertained while we're gone.  Anyone have something that works well for them?

Thanks in advance reddit!  :)

TL;DR: Cats are food obsessed, need help finding a good toy that dispenses treats to keep them occupied while we're away.

**Comments:**

* "I've had great success with the Outward Hound Brick Puzzle. It's a bit pricey, but it's durable and the cats love figuring out how to get the treats out. You can fill it with their favorite treats or even small pieces of cooked chicken."
* "I've tried a few different puzzle toys, but my cats always seem to figure them out too quickly. I've had the best luck with the Pet Zone Treat Wobbler. It's a bit more challenging for them, and they seem to enjoy trying to get the treats out. Plus, it's easy to clean and refill."
* "I've heard great things about the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball. It's a bit more expensive than some of the other options, but it's supposed to be really challenging for cats. You can fill it with treats or even canned food, and it's supposed to keep them occupied for a while."
* "I've tried a few different puzzle toys, but my cats always seem to get bored with them after a few days. I've had the best luck with the Catit Senses 2.0. It's a bit more expensive than some of the other options, but it's supposed to be really challenging and engaging for cats. Plus, it's easy to clean and refill."
* "I've heard that cats can get a bit bored with puzzle toys if they're not challenging enough. Have you tried hiding their food around the house? You can hide small pieces of their food in different spots, and they'll have to use their sense of smell to find it. It's a great way to keep them occupied and stimulated."

TITLE: having intense anxiety about possibly moving out, need advice

POST: Hello all,

So first of all thank you for reading this, now let's get into the meat of my dilemma

I'm currently going to college and my parents have graciously allowed me to live in their home while I'm going to college so I can save the maximum amount of money possible, for which I am very grateful. 

My father lost is Job about six months ago and has been vigorously looking for a new one. He recently has had two opportunities for employment come up. the problem is that one is in the middle of nowhere in the state we live in. They have invited me to go with them to which I have declined; I would like to stay in my current city and finish my degree. 

my anxiety has been running haywire.

logically I make enough money to live with a roommate, pay all of my bills, have extra fun money, and STILL save money. 

but my mind has been wracking itself with self deprecating thoughts and its honestly annoying. I was in the army and I managed just fine, so its not like I haven't been on my own before. I really don't know where this is coming from.  

I'll honestly be fine no what. I would honestly enjoy the option where my parents stay and I keep wracking up savings but I'm also fine with the other option as well, but my mind keeps telling me otherwise.

so I need your advice. How do I quell these thoughts of doom?

TL;DR: I'm having intense anxiety about possibly moving out of my parents' house and living on my own. I've been in the army and have managed just fine, but my mind keeps telling me otherwise. How do I quell these thoughts of doom?

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* "Hey OP, it sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of 'fear of the unknown'. It's normal to feel anxious about change, especially when it comes to living on your own for the first time. Here's a suggestion: try to focus on the things that you can control, like your finances and your education. Remember that you've already proven yourself capable of living independently in the army, so you can do it again. And hey, if things don't work out, you can always adjust and adapt. The key is to be flexible and open-minded. Good luck, and try not to worry too much about it!" - u/throwaway1234567
* "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I went through a similar situation when I was in college, and it was tough. But here's the thing: you're not alone. There are plenty of people who have gone through this and come out the other side just fine. And hey, if you do decide to move out, it'll be an adventure! You'll learn a lot about yourself and gain some valuable life skills. Just remember to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You got this!" - u/collegekid2000
* "Hey OP, I think you're selling yourself short. You're not just 'fine' with living on your own - you're capable of doing it, and you've already proven it. Don't let your anxiety get the best of you. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of living on your own, like having more freedom and autonomy. And hey, if things don't work out, you can always adjust and adapt. The key is to be open-minded and flexible. Good luck, and try not to worry too much about it!" - u/throwaway789012
* "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're not going to fail, and you're not going to be a 'bad' person if you move out and live on your own. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. And hey, if you do decide to move out, it'll be a great opportunity for you to grow and develop as a person. Just remember to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You got this!" - u/throwaway3456789

TITLE: My [35f] ex [34m] is physically abusing his girlfriend [30somethingF]. Should I talk to her?

POST: My ex and I were together for six years, which culminated with him holding a gun to my head threatening to murder me while he was under the influence of a drug (MXE). He has a lot of mental health problems and the drug abuse certainly does not help. 

Since the end of our relationship three+ years ago, he's been in a relationship with one woman and told me that he had gotten clean, which I've since learned is a lie. We have very little contact. Last weekend a mutual friend was with the ex and his gf and he was intoxicated and choked his gf in front of other people. The gf said it's happened a number of times. The next morning when everyone was sober, the gf tried to brush it off and act like everything was fine. She lives with him with her two young children. He still has guns. I'm absolutely terrified for her. 

On one hand, it isn't any of my business. My life changed substantially for the better after getting out of the relationship with my ex and I don't want to involve myself in any drama. I dropped him and everyone associated with him (other than this one mutual friend) back then because of how messed up I was after the gun incident. On the other, I feel like I should tell her about what happened to me so that she knows exactly who she's dealing with (although she may already know). His behavior is clearly escalating, he has guns, and he's still abusing this drug. My current boyfriend, whose opinion I value immensely, says that I should leave it be, but he is obviously biased.

I can't look at this situation objectively. What, if anything, should I do?

TL;DR: My ex is physically abusing his new girlfriend, and I'm torn between not wanting to get involved and feeling like I should warn her about his past behavior. Should I talk to her?

**Top comments:**

1. **You should talk to her.** Your experience with your ex is relevant to this situation, and she has a right to know what she's getting herself into. Even if she already knows, your story can help her understand the severity of the situation and encourage her to take action to protect herself and her children.
2. **Don't get involved.** You've already been through a traumatic experience with your ex, and getting involved in this situation could put you in danger or cause you unnecessary stress. Let the authorities handle it, and focus on your own well-being.
3. **Report it to the authorities.** If you're concerned about the safety of the girlfriend and her children, report the abuse to the authorities. They can investigate and take appropriate action to protect them.
4. **Talk to your mutual friend.** Since your mutual friend was present when the abuse occurred, they may be able to provide more information or help facilitate a conversation with the girlfriend.
5. **Consider a support group.** Your experience with domestic abuse can be helpful in supporting the girlfriend, but it's also important to prioritize your own well-being. Consider joining a support group or seeking counseling to help you process your emotions and develop a plan for your own safety.

**Original poster's response:**

Thank you all for your thoughtful comments. I think I've decided to talk to my mutual friend and see if they can help facilitate a conversation with the girlfriend. I'm still a bit nervous about getting involved, but I feel like I owe it to myself and to the girlfriend to try to help. I'll make sure to prioritize my own safety and well-being throughout this process. Thank you again for your support and advice.

TITLE: Me [28 F] new at dating [30sM], when to start going dutch?

POST: Need some perspective! 

I've been in 2 long-term relationships since high school, so I've never really done the adult dating thing. I recently got out of my last one in the summer, and started casually dating in the fall. I've been having a lot of fun going on dates. For a while it was a string of first-dates and nothing serious, but recently I've been seeing a guy for a month and it's been going really well.

I enjoy spending time with him including going for dinners as we both are foodies, cooking dinner at his place, going out to the bar with his friends, that kind of thing. This past weekend he was acting off-standish and today he said that it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay. I mean I've paid for coffees and movie tickets and a few ones offs but when I thought about, I never did the whole fumbling-with-my-wallet thing very much. He would usually pick it up, but didn't say much after that. We talked it over and I told him of course I would pay for my share from now on. I wasn't even aware of it - I guess in my eyes, we weren't exclusive and if he wanted me to pick up my tab, he would have asked for separate bills or something to the tune of, "Let's split it." I would have been more than happy to - I'm not going out with him for the free ride.

I wanted to get some perspective from outsiders: is there a timeline when the girl should start paying? Is it right away, or after a month? Or totally depends on the guy?

TL;DR: New to dating, unsure when to start paying my share on dates. Guy I've been seeing for a month said it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay. Should I start paying right away or after a certain time?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not about the timeline, it's about the vibe. If you're comfortable with him paying and he's not complaining, then it's not a big deal. But if you're feeling guilty or like you're taking advantage, then it's probably time to start paying your share. Just communicate with him and see how he feels about it."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're considering his feelings and willing to compromise. It's not about the guy being cheap or expecting you to pay, it's about being considerate of each other's feelings. You could try saying something like, 'Hey, I want to make sure we're on the same page. Should we start splitting the bill from now on?'"
3. **u/datingadvice**: "It's not about the guy being cheap or expecting you to pay, it's about being an equal partner. If you're going to be in a relationship, you should be willing to contribute financially. It's not about the timeline, it's about being respectful and considerate of each other's feelings. You could try saying something like, 'Hey, I want to make sure we're on the same page. Should we start splitting the bill from now on?'"
4. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's also important to consider the context of the date. If you're going out for a fancy dinner or a weekend getaway, it's probably okay for him to pick up the tab. But if you're going out for a casual dinner or drinks, it's probably more reasonable to split the bill. Just communicate with him and see how he feels about it."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're considering his feelings and willing to compromise. It's not about the guy being cheap or expecting you to pay, it's about being considerate of each other's feelings. You could try saying something like, 'Hey, I want to make sure we're on the same page. Should we start splitting the bill from now on?'"

**Conclusion:**

The top comments suggest that it's not about the timeline, but rather about the vibe and being considerate of each other's feelings. It's recommended to communicate with your partner and see how they feel about splitting the bill. Some comments suggest that it's okay for the guy to pick up the tab for fancy dates, but for casual dates, it's more reasonable to split the bill. Ultimately, it's about being respectful and considerate of each other's feelings and being willing to compromise. The OP should consider having an open and honest conversation with her partner to find a solution that works for both of them.

TITLE: My roommate is blackmailing my girlfriend and I over stupid shit. We've decided we're not going to take it; any ideas for payback.

POST: Throwaway account just in case.

Short story and context:

Girlfriend is here on a working holiday visa that was recently renewed. To renew said visa we had to call in a favor from a friend. Girlfriend being the trusting type she is told people she was close to including roommate (who up until recently was our friend) about the details of this process.

Situation in the house has been gradually deteriorating for a number of weeks due to silly reasons. Finally we decided to leave and look for our own place. Girlfriends birthday is coming up soon and I decided id like to throw a birthday party for her before leaving. Roommate was totally opposed to the situation, saying there was no day over the next 2 weeks this would be permissible because he had work and other plans blah blah blah. Situation escalated when he started aggressively demanding his way and I called him a tyrant. 

He threatened that if we even so much as have a single person over without his permission he'll go to immigration and try have her deported.

Unfortunately he's a bitter enough prick that I think this is a credible threat. My situation now is this: we have 2 weeks left till we move out, how can I fuck with him as much as possible and make him pay for being a vindictive asshole without him actually carrying out his threat.

TL;DR: Roommate is blackmailing us over stupid shit, we're not taking it anymore, looking for ideas on how to get back at him without risking our girlfriend's visa.

This post has received over 1,500 comments, with many users offering advice and suggestions on how to deal with the situation. Some popular responses include:

* "Document everything": Many users suggest keeping a record of all incidents and conversations with the roommate, including dates, times, and details of what was said and done. This can be useful in case things escalate and you need to prove what happened.
* "Don't engage": Some users advise against engaging with the roommate's behavior, as it can escalate the situation and make things worse. Instead, focus on planning your exit strategy and finding a new place to live.
* "Seek support": Many users suggest talking to friends, family, or a professional counselor about the situation. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to and get advice from.
* "Don't take the bait": Some users advise against responding to the roommate's threats or engaging in a tit-for-tat game. Instead, focus on staying calm and not giving him the satisfaction of getting a reaction out of you.
* "Consider mediation": A few users suggest considering mediation as a way to resolve the situation. This can be a good option if you're willing to work together to find a solution.

Some users also offer more creative suggestions, such as:

* "Fake a party": One user suggests faking a party and inviting a bunch of people over, just to see how the roommate reacts.
* "Play dumb": Another user suggests playing dumb and pretending you don't know what the roommate is talking about, just to see how he reacts.
* "Make a fake immigration appointment": One user suggests making a fake appointment with immigration and telling the roommate that you're going to be there, just to see how he reacts.

It's worth noting that while these suggestions may be entertaining, they may not be the most effective or responsible way to deal with the situation. It's important to prioritize your safety and well-being, and to avoid engaging in any behavior that could put your girlfriend's visa at risk. Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on your specific situation and the dynamics of your living situation.

TITLE: Reddit, a girl with a fake facebook identity is seducing unknown people on facebook for no reason. What should I do?

POST: So I was added as a friend on Facebook by a girl who looked very cute, but I didn't know her. I asked how she knew me, and she said she had made a mistake, and mid apology threw in, "you look cute." Basically we texted back and forth for a few days, and she was extremely, extremely flirty. My suspicious were halted when she would talk to me for 3-4 hours a night on the phone and text me virtually all day. 

I was suspicious, but she had a few hundred friends, a twitter account with a bunch of followers that tweeted at her, etc. It seemed legit, but I noticed one too many red flags.

Long story short, I got suspicious enough I did a few reverse image searches on Google, and sure enough she is using a fake name, has real pictures, but fake info, and has added enough friends to look legitimate. This is truly a work of art. She claimed to live about 45 minutes from me, go to my University, work in a city about an hour away, and even knew a bunch of stuff about our supposed mutual church, etc. Now I realize she lives in Texas, is in a sorority, and it's all lies.

TL;DR: Girl on Facebook is using fake identity, seducing people, and it's a work of art. What should I do?

TITLE: My ex (F21) just broke up with me (M23) because she needed to find herself. But I still want her - how do I eventually get her back?

POST: So I (M23) had been dating her (F21) for two years. Recently, she had become immature and rude to me. She then went back to the US for Christmas break and days before she returned, she said she had to tell me something. She got back and said she went to a party, got black out drunk and was taken advantage of. I believe my ex 100%, but I feel this was just something extra she did to push her over the edge, to give her that excuse to say what she ultimately wanted which was to break up with me. Her rudeness and immaturity that had "developed" wasn't enough to push me away so that I would do the break up, so I guess I interpret this event of her getting taken advantage of as her excuse so that she could do it. When she told me this, I realised she was PARTLY the victim here and was turning to forgive her. But then I asked her if she still loved me and she said she didn't know. She said her views on what love were had changed, she didn't think it existed anymore and she felt she had completely changed. She said she had to find herself, go travelling, see the world and get some perspective. She comes from a very messed up family and suffers with anxiety issues so I understand that she needs to figure that out before she can be with someone. But I am not just losing my girlfriend, I am losing my best friend too and I do not want to lose both. I would love for her to come back to me as my girlfriend but obviously not until she has found herself. Can I still be friends with her while she tries to find herself? I don't want to completely lose her. If anyone has any like 5 steps plans or strategies, please, I would really appreciate it. And also, for those who want to call me a pussy or are just going to insult me, please don't, I'm having a hard enough time as it is, and please just constructive advice. Thank you.

TL;DR: My ex broke up with me because she needed to find herself, but I still have feelings for her. I want to be friends with her while she does that, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Can anyone help me with a 5-step plan to get her back or at least maintain a friendship?

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in online communities: the "help me get my ex back" post. The OP (original poster) is seeking advice on how to win back his ex, who has broken up with him due to her own personal issues and a desire to find herself. The post is a mix of emotional vulnerability, self-reflection, and a desire for guidance.

The post has several key elements that make it relatable and engaging:

1. Emotional authenticity: The OP is open and honest about his feelings, which makes the post more relatable and human.
2. Specific details: The OP provides specific details about the breakup, including the events leading up to it and his ex's reasons for leaving. This helps readers understand the situation better.
3. Vulnerability: The OP is willing to admit his flaws and mistakes, which makes him more likable and easier to empathize with.
4. A clear goal: The OP has a clear goal in mind (winning back his ex or maintaining a friendship), which gives readers a sense of direction and purpose.

The post also has some common pitfalls that can make it less effective:

1. Overemphasis on the ex: The OP spends a lot of time talking about his ex and her reasons for leaving, which can make the post seem overly focused on her.
2. Lack of self-reflection: While the OP acknowledges his own flaws, he doesn't spend enough time reflecting on his own role in the breakup or his own personal growth.
3. Unrealistic expectations: The OP seems to expect that his ex will eventually come back to him, which may not be realistic or healthy.

Overall, the post is a good example of how to share a personal story online and seek advice from others. However, it could benefit from more self-reflection and a more nuanced understanding of the situation.

TITLE: Friend wants me to pitch in money for gift

POST: I belong to a friend group and when one of our friends found out her mom's cancer was no longer being helped by chemo and her condition was terminal apparently someone decided we'd send an edible arrangement. Don't get me wrong I think it was a nice gesture but we're poor college students and it was going to involve each of us pitching in $12. In our group chat another girl and I said it was too much and maybe we could find something else. That was the last I heard of it until our friend who left sent a message thanking all of us for the EA. That was in February and I've forgotten about it until now; the girl "in charge" just texted and asked me to pay her the $12 for the EA. 

I don't want to be an ass but I didn't agree to paying for it and yet I'm still expected to. I sent our friend something little on my own thinking I wasn't included in the fruit. I know $12 doesn't seem like much but I'm pretty broke plus honestly I don't really think it's fair I have to pay. the girl who asked for the money and I aren't really close so I don't know how to handle this.

TL;DR: Friend group sent an edible arrangement for a friend's mom and I was asked to pay $12 even though I didn't agree to it. I'm broke and don't think it's fair. How do I handle this?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, just tell your friend that you didn't agree to pay for the edible arrangement and you're not in a financial position to do so. You can say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the thought, but I didn't agree to pay for the edible arrangement and I'm not in a good financial spot right now. Maybe we can find something else to do for our friend?'"
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable about this situation. It's important to communicate your concerns with your friend in a respectful and clear manner. You could say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the thought, but I didn't agree to pay for the edible arrangement and I'm not in a financial position to do so. Can we find something else to do for our friend?'"
3. **u/throwaway7890**: "I would suggest having a conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. You could say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the edible arrangement.

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'll just be honest with my friend and explain my situation. I don't want to be an ass, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of. I'll try to find a compromise, like doing something else for our friend instead of paying for the edible arrangement. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: So my girlfriend (29F) broke up with me (29M) about 6 weeks ago. She keeps giving me mixed signals about getting back together, what should I do?

POST: So she decided we needed some time and space from me on the weekend I was planning to propose (she didn't know about my plans), we got to talking about our relationship and some issues that had been swept under the rug for a while finally came to light on both our ends. After 2 weeks of space and time I started reaching out to try and work things out, she said she needed more time I said we should work on things together, after a bit of a discussion she decided if I can't give her the time and space then it's over and broke up with me. It's been a total of 6 weeks including the time a day space. We've stayed in contact the whole time and some days she seems to be hinting at getting back together and other days she's very standoffish and says we'll never get back together, just give up hope. With all the back and forth, I heard she was dating someone now so I asked and she said she's not, she's just friends with a guy but they're talking a lot and getting to know each other but that's it. Then the next day she's telling me how much she loves me and got upset that I deleted our pics off social media (yet she had unfriended me weeks ago). She says she wants to keep a friendship with me but I told her I can't, not with how in love I still am and specially not if she's talking to someone else because I think it's BS she won't try to fix things with me, but is willing to give someone else her time and attention. I love her, more than I've ever loved any woman before, she's the first and only girl I've ever bought an engagement ring for. My family adores her, my kids have become attached to her and call her mommy, her son has done the same with me and calls me dad. I just don't know what to do now, I'm tired of feeling depressed and being on this emotional Rollercoaster of getting my hopes up one day, and shooting me down the next. What do you guys suggest I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend broke up with me 6 weeks ago, we've been in contact the whole time, she's giving me mixed signals about getting back together, I'm tired of the emotional rollercoaster and don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not ready to commit to you or work on your relationship. She's giving you mixed signals because she's not sure what she wants. You deserve better than to be strung along like this. It's okay to take a step back and focus on yourself. You're not going to get closure or a clear answer from her, so it's time to move on."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being too invested in the idea of getting back together. You've been in contact with her for 6 weeks, but you're not making any progress. It's time to accept that she's not interested in working on your relationship. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to make things work. Don't waste your time on someone who is just going to keep you in limbo."
3. **u/itsjustme123**: "I think you should take a break from her and focus on yourself. You're clearly still in love with her, but she's not reciprocating those feelings. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and that's not going to happen if you're constantly chasing after someone who doesn't want you. Take some time to work on yourself, and see if you can find happiness without her."
4. **u/loveisntenough**: "I think you're being too possessive and controlling. You're not giving her the space she needs, and that's why she's not willing to work on your relationship. You need to learn to let go and trust that she'll make her own decisions. If she's not interested in getting back together, then it's time to move on. You can't force someone to love you."
5. **u/itscomplicated**: "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and what you want. You've been in contact with her for 6 weeks, and it's clear that you're still invested in the relationship. Maybe she's not ready to commit, but maybe she's willing to work on things if you can have a real conversation about what you both want. Just be prepared for the possibility that she may not want to work on things, and you'll need to accept that."

TITLE: Me [18M/] got cheated on by my girlfriend of 2 years [18/F]. We broke up.

POST: I'm a mess. She cheated on me with someone she met in Spain at a festival. I absolutely adore this girl. I've known her for about 7/8 years, and there's always been something between us. We properly got together 2 years ago, and it was the happiest I've ever been.

She's my best friend, the person who I could tell everything to. I don't have anyone else to talk to and now I'm just falling apart. She told me yesterday and I didn't sleep at all last night. The pain is unlike anything I've ever felt, and the only person who I could possible talk about it with was her. I feel more lonely now then I can ever remember.

We were supposed to be going on holiday next week together, that's out the window now. It was with my family and I have to tell them today. My family adored her.

I'm just at a loss right now. I never would've suspected she would do something like this. I am so angry at her but at the same time I want to stay with her with all of my being. I don't have anyone else to talk to.

She's been my life for 2 years, and now in an instant she's gone. I just feel empty and this is the most emotional pain I've ever felt in my life. I don't know what to do, who to talk to or where to go. Please help.

TL;DR: My 2-year girlfriend cheated on me with someone she met at a festival. I'm devastated and don't know what to do. I feel lost and alone.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. It's understandable that you're feeling lost and alone right now. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They can help you process your emotions and work through this difficult time.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about the cheating. It's never easy to deal with, but it's even harder when it's someone you love and trust. Have you considered taking some time for yourself to reflect on the relationship and what you want to do next? It might be helpful to take a break from social media and other distractions to focus on your own healing.
3. **u/sadpanda**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and confusion right now. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Have you considered reaching out to a trusted friend or family member to talk about what happened? Sometimes talking to someone who knows you well can be really helpful.
4. **u/cheatingpartner**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. I know how it feels to be cheated on, and it's never easy. But I want you to know that you deserve so much better than someone who would cheat on you. You deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are. Don't give up on yourself, and don't settle for someone who doesn't appreciate you.
5. **u/relationshipcoach**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about the cheating. It's never easy to deal with, but it's an opportunity for you to reflect on the relationship and what you want to do next. Have you considered taking some time to focus on yourself and your own healing? It might be helpful to set some boundaries and prioritize your own needs for a while. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.

TITLE: What do you programmers / engineers think of your project managers?

POST: Hey all,

I wanted to start a legitimate conversation about how coders view project managers and why they have those views. I am coming to the end of my senior year and I begin grad school in August where my focus will be in project management within the information technology realm. 

I myself have some background in coding (Java, Javascript, C, C#, VB.NET, some HTML / ASP.NET, SQL / MySQL) but not enough interest, drive, or skill to go out and do what you all do. I feel I have always been more of a people driven worker, and my passion for technology has helped me to decide to stay involved with it; this is why I landed in the world of Project Management. However, it disturbs me to see how many members of project teams despise their managers. 

I am asking you all this because I am finally able to start putting work in to really accelerate my learning in this sector, and one of the things I strongly believe in is getting information from the source. So I'm ask you all now;

What do you think of your P.M.'s? Why do you think it? What would you suggest to make them better? 

I'm doing this so  when my time comes, I can be the best manager possible, so please no flaming.

TL;DR: As a soon-to-be project manager, I want to know what programmers and engineers think of their project managers. What do you think of them? Why do you think it? What would you suggest to make them better?

TITLE: OK PEOPLE LISTEN UP! What do you believe Beauty to be? How do you define Beauty?

POST: Ok people listen up! I am doing a survey about what people perceive beauty to be. So here's the bottom line post a discussion so that I may reap the benefits and generate a discussion. 

next, you either PM me or comment. If you can send me a picture/ preferably send me a picture of what you believe beauty to be. anonymously or not, upload a photo or not, do what you wish, as long as as it relates to this question: What do you think beauty is? Maybe it is a little much to ask but I would like to have honest answers. If you don't want to be honest that's fine, I like funny shit. 

Here is the kicker, I want you to define what beauty is to you. I don't mean what you think is beautiful but rather what you perceive to be the definition of beauty pertaining specifically to your own life. Please post pictures as that is the main purpose aside from the notion of generating discussion. 

you can also submit your photos and videos to the tumblr survey. Although I know how a lot of you feel about tumblr. For those interested it's as follows:

TL;DR: What do you believe Beauty to be? How do you define Beauty? Share your thoughts and pictures/videos anonymously or not.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I think beauty is subjective and can be found in many things, like a beautiful sunset, a work of art, or even a kind act from a stranger. For me, beauty is about the way something makes me feel, whether it's a sense of wonder, peace, or joy.
2. **u/beautyisntskindeep**: I believe beauty is more than just physical appearance. It's about being confident, kind, and genuine. It's about being true to yourself and not trying to fit into societal norms. For me, beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin and not caring what others think.
3. **u/photographylover**: I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but for me, it's about capturing the perfect moment or light. I love taking photos of nature, cityscapes, and people, and finding beauty in the everyday moments.
4. **u/fitnessenthusiast**: I believe beauty is about being healthy and strong. It's about taking care of your body and pushing yourself to be the best version of yourself. For me, beauty is about feeling confident and capable in my own skin.
5. **u/artist**: I think beauty is about creativity and self-expression. It's about bringing something new and unique into the world, whether it's through art, music, or writing. For me, beauty is about taking risks and being true to my own vision.
6. **u/environmentalist**: I believe beauty is about the natural world and our place in it. It's about respecting and preserving the beauty of the earth, and finding ways to live in harmony with nature. For me, beauty is about being mindful of our impact on the planet and working to make a positive difference.
7. **u/philosopher**: I think beauty is a complex and multifaceted concept that can't be reduced to a single definition. It's about the way we experience the world, and the way we perceive and interpret beauty. For me, beauty is about the search for meaning and truth, and the pursuit of wisdom and understanding.

* A photo of a beautiful sunset
* A video of a kind act from a stranger

TITLE: Why did I not come here before?

POST: I was referred here during finals week last semester, but I never actually got around to looking at this sub until today. Seeing all of the posts, I can't help but feel awe and shame. Why do I take each day for granted and not strive for greatness like you do? I used to think myself a perfectionist because I force myself to be discouraged when I am not perfect, but that isn't the point of having the goal of perfection. The point is to keep moving, to welcome the defeat and criticism and just move forward and up. That's why I was reminded of [this,] and I just wanted to thank you all. My rugby club is in the playoffs now, and seeing all of these posts reminded me of what I need to be doing to improve myself and my skills.

TL;DR: I finally joined this sub and I'm feeling inspired to improve myself and my skills. I'm grateful for the reminder to keep moving forward and welcome defeat and criticism.

After only ever teaching in middle/upper class areas, working with these kids has been a very eye-opening experience. I'll cut to the chase though... Today was my last day working with this particular class of kids, and one table started talking about when they were afraid of their parents. Two girls admitted that their parents regularly belted them, with one also saying her dad whipped her with metal wire, too, and the other saying her dad pounded her hand with a brick. When I tried to tell them that it was wrong for their parents to hurt them and told them it's illegal, they disagreed and thought it wasn't illegal. Yet another started crying when she got a somewhat poor progress report she had to take home for her parents to sign, saying her dad was going to beat her like he usually did. A different girl also told me that her mom calls her a "fat bitch" and that her dad was deported and went to jail after trying to kill her mother.

I asked the graduate student who serves as supervisor of the other undergraduate mentors like me what, if anything, I should do. Her exact words were, "If you didn't see bruises, you can't say shit." In a sad way I agree, and I realize I also have no proof that these kids are telling the truth, although they seemed serious. But thinking about some man taking a brick to a 9 year-old girl just makes me sick.
So I thought I'd ask you, Reddit. What can or should I do? I need some peace of mind.

Some background notes: I am a 20 year-old white female in California. My kids are 5th graders, primarily Hispanic, and low income. I am not an official teacher or counselor-- just a college volunteer mentor.

TL;DR: I'm a college student volunteering at an elementary school, and I've been exposed to some disturbing stories from the kids about their parents' abuse. I'm unsure what to do, as my supervisor told me that if I didn't see bruises, I can't say anything. I'm looking for advice on what I can do to help these kids and feel better about the situation.

This post is a heart-wrenching account of a college student's experience volunteering at an elementary school. The student is torn between their desire to help the children and their uncertainty about what they can do in the face of such disturbing stories. The post highlights the challenges of addressing child abuse and the limitations that can come with not having concrete evidence.

The comments on this post are a mix of advice, concerns, and personal experiences. Some users offer suggestions on how to report the abuse, while others express their own experiences with similar situations. The post also sparks a discussion about the importance of addressing child abuse and the need for more support systems for these children.

Some notable comments include:

* "If you're not an official teacher or counselor, it's best to report your concerns to the school administration or local child protective services. They have the training and resources to handle these situations."
* "I'm a social worker, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for kids to downplay or deny abuse. But it's still important to report your concerns and let the professionals handle it."
* "I'm a survivor of child abuse myself, and I can tell you that it's not easy to talk about. But it's important to create a safe and supportive environment for these kids to open up. You're doing a great job just by listening to them and showing them that you care."
* "I'm not sure what to say, but I'm glad you're speaking out about this. It's not okay for kids to be abused, and it's not okay for us to turn a blind eye. We need to do better."

Overall, this post highlights the importance of addressing child abuse and the need for more support systems for these children. It also shows the impact that one person can have by simply listening and showing empathy to those who have been affected.

TITLE: I've lied to all of my friends and built a false image of myself for anyone I have ever met.

POST: I don't know when it started. I don't know why it started. Most people put on masks or armor when dealing with others. I have so many mask and so many sets of armor. I can't pretend to be a real person anymore. I can't pretend that people know and understand me anymore.

Let me try and give you some background.

I am an 18 year old senior that had a chance to go to MIT full ride. I'm reasonable intelligent, 5;10, lithe wiry musculature, 140 lbs. I play sports, I did martial arts, I took advanced placement classes and I was friends with everyone. I did not date because I kept telling myself there was no one I really liked. That is what helped bring this all to a head.

It's not that there wasn't a girl that I liked enough to date, it's that there wasn't a single person around me who I could open up to. Who I could explain that I was a fake. That I lied about my childhood to everyone. That I lied about my adolescence to everyone. I've had plenty of friends, if you can call them that. I've had flings with women, if you can call them flings. I've been the life of the party and the main actor in a spotlight.

I've never been me.

Moving on now to the internet, I've been browsing for about eight years now. I was the generic kiddo on the internet for the first four. I quickly grew tired and developed yet another false identity.

I was a 16 year old Asian girl that went to my school for years. Some of my friends still don't know mostly because we haven't talked in a while. I took on a maternal role for a forum, quickly becoming a therapist in a sense. People would come to me and ask me for life advice and other nonsense and I would lie to them about who and what I was and give them their idiotic advice. Some would come back with success stories. Others would come back for more advice.

I'm really just rambling now and have no clue where i wanted to take this.

TL;DR: I'm 18, I've been lying to everyone about who I am and what I've done. I've built a false image of myself and I don't know how to stop. I've been doing this for so long that I don't know who I am anymore. I'm scared to be myself because I don't know if anyone will like me. I'm scared to be myself because I don't know if I'll like myself.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not alone. I've been in similar situations and it's tough to break free from the facade. But you're taking the first step by acknowledging it. That's huge. You don't have to be perfect, and nobody expects you to be. Just be honest and authentic, and people will respond to that."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. It takes a lot of courage to admit to lying and pretending to be someone you're not. I think it's amazing that you're taking the first step towards being honest with yourself and others. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're not defined by your past. You are capable of change and growth, and I believe in you."
* "I've been in similar situations where I felt like I had to put on a mask to fit in. But the truth is, nobody is perfect, and nobody expects you to be. It's okay to be yourself, flaws and all. You don't have to be someone you're not to impress others. You are enough, just as you are."
* "I think it's really brave of you to share this. It can't be easy to admit to lying and pretending to be someone you're not. But I think it's a huge step towards healing and growth. Remember that you don't have to do it alone. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it."
* "I'm so proud of you for being honest and vulnerable. It takes a lot of courage to admit to our flaws and imperfections. Remember that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you. You are enough, just as you are. Don't be afraid to be yourself and to make mistakes. That's where the real growth happens."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my parents [50s M/F]. Father is emotionally abusive to my mother-questions

POST: Sorry for wall of text.

This is an issue that has been ongoing for most of my life. My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother. Luckily it has never turned physical (AFAIK), but whenever I visit home, I hear my father scream at and berate my mother for every little thing. For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).

I'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him. Whenever I bring up this issue, she always tells me that he is working on his temper and has other good qualities. However, my mother consistently tells me that he wasn't like this when she married him and if she had known how he would turn out, she wouldn't have.

I've already told her that when I have children I will be extremely hesitant to leave them alone with my parents. Their relationship has affected my own views on relationships greatly. Beyond that, I'm not sure what I can do. Cut off all contact until she leaves him? Just continue to ignore it for the rest of my life? I have no idea what the protocol is for situations like this.

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being a passive bystander.

Summary of what he does: demeans her opinions and beliefs, always believes he is right, yells constantly, doesn't care about feelings, constantly makes threats.

TL;DR: Father is emotionally abusive to my mother, I'm tired of seeing it and don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. OP, you're not a passive bystander. You're a victim of your father's abuse, and you're taking the first step by acknowledging it and seeking help. That takes a lot of courage. I think it's great that you're considering cutting off contact until your mother leaves him. It's not an easy decision, but it might be the best one for your own well-being. - u/throwaway1234567890
2. OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault, and it's not your mother's fault either. Your father's behavior is unacceptable, and he needs to take responsibility for it. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you process your feelings and develop a plan to deal with the situation. - u/therapist123
3. OP, I think it's great that you're considering your own well-being in this situation. It's not selfish to prioritize your own needs, especially when you're being exposed to emotional abuse. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your mother about how his behavior is affecting you. Let her know that you're not going to stand by and watch her get abused anymore. - u/strongwoman
4. OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It's not okay for your father to treat your mother like that. Have you considered talking to a trusted family member or friend about this? Sometimes having someone to talk to can help you feel less alone and more supported. - u/concernedcitizen
5. OP, I think it's great that you're taking the initiative to address this situation. It's not easy to confront emotional abuse, but it's necessary. I would suggest having a plan in place for when your mother does leave him. Make sure you're supporting her and helping her through this difficult time. - u/empoweredwoman

TITLE: TIFU by falling in love with a lesbian

POST: This happened last summer at UConn. I live in Connecticut.

My bestfriend has a girlfriend, who has an apartment at UConn. I like to drink and got really drunk walking around after we tried to sneak into a bar without paying the upfront tab.

We tried to get in through the kitchen. It smelt like buffalo wings, I led the way.

Non-sequitur. 

We got kicked out almost immediately. Being my drunk self, I lost my friends and made new friends, which I believe were frat boys. 

Drunk dancing like the left shark in the Super Bowl and started talking to hot black girls. They say they have a lesbian friend. Drunk JJ only hears Barney Stinson(I love HIMYM) say "Make a lesbian straight. Legen-dary." 

Meet lesbian friend, hook up and dance, fall in drunken love with a girl who is cool. For the first time in my life, my hook up meant something. We talked and I actually liked this girl. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later to a random dorm. She's hooking up with another random dude. And another dude. 

She hooked up with 3 other dudes after me. I don't think she was a lesbian. 

Drunk JJ doesn't care. She jumps on my lap and starts kissing me again after these other dudes. I liked it till I get that I'm being played.

My heart was broken until I realized there's a lot of lesbians I can turn straight. 

After leaving this random dorm, I got attacked by a deer. A deer in the middle of UConn's campus jumped me. I ran away and lived to tell this story to reddit.

I was so lost and drunk my best friends girlfriend had to find me. In the meantime, I ran into a skunk who ran away from me. I believe it was because of the fake lesbian smell.

TL;DR: Drunk JJ falls in love with a girl who claims to be a lesbian, but ends up hooking up with multiple dudes. Deer attacks JJ, and JJ runs away with a fake lesbian smell.

---

This post has been edited for clarity and grammar. The original post was written in a more casual and humorous tone, which has been preserved in this edited version.

The post is a humorous account of a man's (JJ's) experience at a college party, where he gets drunk and falls in love with a girl who claims to be a lesbian. However, it turns out that the girl is not a lesbian and has been hooking up with multiple dudes. JJ is heartbroken but eventually realizes that there are many lesbians he can turn straight.

The post also includes a series of unrelated events, such as JJ getting attacked by a deer and running into a skunk, which adds to the humor and absurdity of the story.

The post has been shared widely on Reddit and has received many comments and reactions from users. Some users have praised JJ's honesty and humor, while others have criticized him for his behavior and the way he treated the girl. Overall, the post has sparked a lot of discussion and debate about the importance of consent, respect, and honesty in relationships.

TITLE: Me [17 M] with a girl [16 F] who I don't know how to let down.

POST: There is a backstory behind this so let me give it to everyone straight. I'm 17 M never dated anyone before. I have made posts prior to this one based around my issues with being able to date.

My biggest issue is that once a girl peeks my interest I pursue her until she develops the same feelings. Once I understand she is interested too I sort of back off. A friend of mine called me a "chaser" which is what I feel I am.

Now I have this girl that I know, really sweet, really smart, talented, the whole thing. I found recently she has feelings for me and we talked a bit about it after I mentioned I was aware of them. 

When we talked I gave her the impression that I wanted to date her and that we should talk in person and hang out a big more to be dating. The only issue is my gut AGAIN like always is telling me I'm not interested even though I really want to be, I'm just not.

TL;DR: I have a girl who has feelings for me and I'm not sure how to let her down without hurting her. I've never dated before and I don't know how to handle this.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you gotta be honest with her. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to lead her on. You can say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate your feelings, but I don't feel the same way. I think you're an amazing person, but I don't think we're a good match for me.' Be kind, be respectful, and be clear. It's okay to not feel the same way, and it's better to be honest than to string her along."
* "I agree with the above comment. Honesty is always the best policy. You can also offer to remain friends if that's something she'd be interested in. It's better to be upfront and clear than to lead her on and potentially hurt her more in the long run."
* "I think you should also consider why you're not interested. Is it because you're not ready to date, or is it because you're not attracted to her? If it's the former, you could say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate your feelings, but I'm not ready to date right now. I think you're an amazing person, but I need some time to focus on myself.' If it's the latter, you should be honest with yourself and with her. It's okay to not be attracted to someone, and it's better to be honest than to lead her on."
* "I think you should also consider the fact that you've never dated before. It's okay to not know what you want or what you're looking for. You could say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate your feelings, but I'm still figuring out what I want in a relationship. I think you're an amazing person, but I need some time to focus on myself and figure out what I'm looking for.'"
* "I think you should also consider the fact that you're 17 and she's 16. You're both still pretty young, and it's okay to not know what you want or what you're looking for. You could say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate your feelings, but I'm still figuring out what I want in a relationship. I think you're an amazing person, but I need some time to focus on myself and figure out what I'm looking for.'"

**OP's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for the advice. I really appreciate it. I think I'm going to take the advice and be honest with her. I'm going to tell her that I appreciate her feelings, but I don't feel the same way. I'm going to be kind and respectful, and I'm going to offer to remain friends if that's something she'd be interested in.

I think I need to take some time to figure out why I'm not interested, and I think being honest with myself and with her is the best way to do that. I'm going to try to be more mindful of my feelings and not chase after someone just because I'm lonely or bored.

Thanks again for the advice, and I'll make sure to update you all on how it goes."

TITLE: Petty pool day destruction

POST: So yesterday my girlfriend and I were at a public pool trying to relax a little bit and maybe catch up on some reading. Unfortunately it started raining so we took shelter under a little poolside gondola that fitted two people. The two of us were sitting and talking and having a nice time when a tennis ball bounced over to us. I noticed a group of about five boys around the age of 12 looking at me so I assumed they had accidentally overthrown it and rolled the ball back to them. 

Two minutes passed and another ball flies up to me. Again I rolled it back. After the third ball I knew something was up and I started to watch as the boys would wait until we weren't looking and throw a ball at us and then run up and retrieve it. After multiple throws, one of the balls flew up and smacked my girlfriend right in the chest. I threw all of the tennis balls I collected over the fence and glared at the laughing kids. 

The lifeguard walked up to us with a smile and told us to let her know if they threw another ball because she would love to kick them out. She also mentioned that she had berated the kids. 

Two of the kids came up and gave us a meek apology but my petty revenge was already plotted. The kids had not thrown a ball after the lifeguard's talk but on our way out we stopped by her stand and told her how they threw more balls at us. My girlfriend and I watched triumphantly as their pool day came to a sudden close.

TL;DR: A group of kids threw tennis balls at us at a public pool, we got revenge by telling the lifeguard and watching them get kicked out.

---

This post is a great example of petty revenge, as the author and their girlfriend take advantage of the lifeguard's offer to report the kids' behavior and then watch as they get kicked out of the pool. The author's use of the phrase "my petty revenge was already plotted" suggests that they had been planning their revenge from the moment the kids started throwing the tennis balls.

The post also highlights the importance of taking advantage of opportunities for revenge, as the author and their girlfriend were able to capitalize on the lifeguard's willingness to help them. The use of the word "triumphantly" to describe their reaction to the kids getting kicked out adds to the sense of satisfaction and revenge.

Overall, this post is a great example of petty revenge in action, and it's likely to resonate with readers who have ever felt the need to get revenge on someone who has wronged them.

TITLE: Not sure if this is the right place. My [30m] SO [28f] doesn't think she's pretty.

POST: I recently saw a commercial on TV for Dove soap. In the commercial a statistic came on the screen that stated, "9 out of 10 women do not think they are beautiful"

My gf [28f] falls into the 9 out of 10 women who think that. 

She is blonde, blue eyes and petite. Has amazing curves in all the right places. Big breasts and a great ass. She exercises three times a week. Loves to dirt bike and shoot guns!  (I think her personality is just as beautiful as her body)

When we walk down the street,  almost every guy we walk past checks her out. She doesn't notice this. My guy friends have all let me know I'm pretty lucky to have found a girl as good looking as her. Her female friends are jealous of her body. Her bi friend has even expressed interest in having sex with her!

What I'm getting at here is that she is clearly beautiful to everyone but herself. :(

She recently has expressed the desire to get botox done on her forehead and between her eyebrows. Preventive measure she'll tell me. 

I don't disagree or think it a bad idea. I just feel like she's doing it for the wrong reason. That reason being that she feels like she's not pretty. 

She had a breast reduction in the last year. And recently started getting her eyelashes extended. I think this is relevant. 

What can I do? I tell her all the time she's beautiful. I'll send random texts, leave notes in her lunch, flowers. Everything I can to get her to accept she's pretty. 

I want her to feel pretty before she needs to change her entire body.

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't think she's pretty, despite being physically attractive. She's considering botox and other cosmetic procedures. I want to help her see her own beauty, but I'm not sure how.

TITLE: Should I be concerned about my friend's one time use of MDMA?

POST: So I've always had the "traditional" view on drugs I.e. all drugs are bad etc. When I met my friend, who smokes weed, I've attempted to open my mind somewhat about drugs. I don't have a problem with her smoking weed in fact I've tried it with her a few times.  
However, last night she told me that a few weeks ago she and a couple of friends did MDMA. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Because of my upbringing, I always thought MDMA will fuck you over big style, but after I did some research I felt a little better. I'm still uneasy though. She did say "I probably wouldn't want to do it again, it was fun and all but ehh"  
Am I right to be concerned that she's going to have no qualms about trying even harder stuff I.e heroin, crack, meth?  
There's a certain uneasiness I feel in addition, which I can't quite pin down, I think it stems to the fact that my wonderful, awesome friend is trying things I'd never considered her doing, and that opens a new side to her I've never seen before. But thats my problem, not hers.

TL;DR: Friend did MDMA once, I'm concerned about her future drug use. Should I be worried?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think you're overthinking this. MDMA is a relatively safe drug when used responsibly. It's not like she's going to suddenly start doing harder drugs just because she did MDMA once. If you're concerned about her drug use, have an open and honest conversation with her about it. But don't assume the worst just because she did something you don't agree with."
2. **skeptical_scientist**: "I agree with throwaway123456. MDMA is a relatively safe drug, and the risks are largely associated with the environment and the people you're with, rather than the drug itself. If your friend is responsible and has a good support system, it's unlikely that one time use of MDMA will lead to a downward spiral. That being said, it's always a good idea to have open and honest conversations with your friends about their drug use and to encourage them to make responsible choices."
3. **concerned_citizen**: "I understand your concerns, but I think you're being a bit dramatic. MDMA is a relatively safe drug, and the risks are largely associated with the environment and the people you're with, rather than the drug itself. If your friend is responsible and has a good support system, it's unlikely that one time use of MDMA will lead to a downward spiral. That being said, it's always a good idea to have open and honest conversations with your friends about their drug use and to encourage them to make responsible choices."
4. **MDMA_user**: "I've done MDMA many times and I can tell you that it's a relatively safe drug when used responsibly. The risks are largely associated with the environment and the people you're with, rather than the drug itself.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my gf [19 F] of 6 months, communicate too much?

POST: we've been speaking to eachother practically every day, atleast every few hours for the last 6 months and this morning she just started ignoring me? i see her active on social media yet she doesnt respond to anything i say, which is weird. but im starting to realize just how much we communicate so maybe this is healthy? 

i dont think ive ever really been in a "healthy" relationship before, my last gf of a year cheated on me the one and only night we decided to go off to separate parties in a year long relationship, and we communicated daily. so should i say something, or... am i being too clingy?

Some possible responses to this post could be:

* "Hey OP, it's normal to feel concerned when someone you care about is ignoring you. Have you tried reaching out to her and asking if everything is okay?"
* "I think you're being a bit too clingy, OP. It's okay to give your girlfriend some space. Maybe try not to message her for a day or two and see if she reaches out to you."

Overall, this post is a great example of how to ask for advice on a relationship issue and how to engage with others in a respectful and thoughtful way.

TITLE: TIFU by getting high and petting my dog

POST: Me and my brother got high this morning and decided to plug in the ole gamecube to the tv, so we go to our garage to find it. We find it and we decide to take it upstairs. 

(We have some stairs that lead from the house into the garage, and we did not realize our dog followed us down the stairs to the garage.)

Anyways I tell my brother I will carry her up the stairs and he can keep taking the gamecube to the room.

(I got a big golden retriever dog thats pretty old so she doesn't like to climb up stairs, shes around 80 pounds or something like that)

Anyways as I go to pick her up, and me being high as fuck still thought she was very soft. (I was also shirtless so it felt really good)

So I start rubbing against her and hugging her and all of a sudden my garage door opens up and three construction workers were staring at me, shirtless, in the middle of a garage, rubbing against my dog.

(apparently there was some work being done today I forgot about)

They just started in awe for a little bit then one of them was like "well give you a few more mins" and they walked away for a bit, two of them looking confused as fuck and one of them chuckling...

TL;DR: Got high, petted my dog in the garage, construction workers walked in on me, now I'm mortified.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author, who is high and shirtless, decides to pet their dog in the garage, not realizing that their dog has followed them down the stairs. The construction workers who were working in the garage walk in on the author, leading to a mortifying situation. The author's high state of mind and lack of awareness of their surroundings contribute to the awkwardness of the situation. The post is relatable, entertaining, and a great example of a TIFU story.

TITLE: Hotel room next door won't turn down their TV...

POST: I moved into a super crappy extended stay hotel for a week because my apartment lease ran up on friday and I can't move into my new place until Wednesday. Horrible management, ghetto furniture, weird smell, half working heater, but whatever I'm a single guy right? Suck it up, save a few bucks by staying in a cheapo place.
We'll along with all that are paper thin walls and a horrible neighbor that moved in yesterday. They have a dog that barked all day yestersay and when they finally got home they turned their TV volume way up. I went and knocked on their door twice asking to turn it down with no result. Didn't get to sleep until 1 when they finally turned it off.

Cut to today, I've had 3 more hours of dog barking until they got home and then dancing with the stars cranked way up followed by what I think is Nancy Grace coverage of Furgeson and they won't even answer the door this time. I'm done at this point so I hooked up my laptop, maxed the TV and hit play on a 30 minute Nyan Cat loop. I'm ready to fight dirty. Up next is heavy metal from my high school days. 

Muted the TV at the end of typing this, I've won! They turned it down!

TL;DR: Hotel room next door won't turn down their TV, so I played Nyan Cat on max volume and won. Now they're quiet.

TITLE: Studying in Madrid this July, have a free week after. What should I do?

POST: Basically, as the title says, I'll be studying in Madrid this coming July through a program with my (American) university. 

I have a free week after and am trying to figure out how I would best spend it. I realize it's not a lot of time, but I'd like to hear what you would do if you had an extra week.

I'll probably have seen enough of Spain (and a little bit of Portugal, probably) to be happy, so I'm thinking of traveling elsewhere in Europe. However, I'm a Brazilian citizen, which probably doesn't affect much, but it's worth considering if I have to cross borders. 

I don't expect to go backpacking/hiking/scuba-diving or anything like that in such a short amount of time, but I'd be very happy being a "fish out of water." I love beaches and mountains, really any scenery or cities would be cool with me. 

Basically, this would just be a good way for me to whet my appetite with a little bit of Europe. Probably I have enough time to explore maybe two cities or so counting travel, maybe see a good museum or two and eat some interesting food. 

If you have suggestions (anybody know anything about getting into the Paris tunnels?) about any thing that I just **need** to see/visit/eat/dance or something, I'd love to hear it. Also, my birthday falls during this free week, and I don't know if I'll have any companions with me as of yet, but anything I could do to celebrate my birthday would be cool as well.

TL;DR: I have a free week in July after studying in Madrid, and I'm looking for suggestions on what to do. I'm open to traveling, exploring cities, seeing museums, eating interesting food, and celebrating my birthday.

TITLE: My [19F] FWB [23 M] secretly took screenshots of my nudes. I want them deleted, he said no. What do I do?

POST: Throwaway account. I have never posted on Reddit ever so please be gentle on the formatting! I am trying my best.

I met Nick* on Tinder. I was just checking it out for fun, my best friend loved and used it etc. I met up with him and we just hung out. He's a nice guy and I just had broken up with my ex. So we became friends with benefits.

Since I left that summer for college, we just sext a lot. And often it was just texting but sometimes he would ask me for some pictures and I was naive  so I thought a 3 second picture on snapchat should get the job done and keep me safe.

Three months into this; snapchat notified me with the little triangle symbol that he had screenshoted it. And I **FLIPPED OUT**. I told him it made me uncomfortable and so the next time we met up, I had him deleted them off his computer. And I thought he understood that I didn't like the fact that he saved the pictures. He said he would stop. 

Recently, we met up and I asked him if he saved any of the pictures. And he said that he didn't. However, I saw on his phone that he had one of the apps that allows you to secretly screenshot snaps without letting the other person know.  

When he returned, I asked again. And he said maybe he saved a few and that he only did it because he really liked them and he saved them for fun. I begged him to delete the pictures and he said no. So I left. And he deleted me off snapchat. 

This guy that I trusted, has nudes of me. I am terrified and I understand I should never ever taken them in the first place. But I never thought he would be this kind of person. He was so sweet in the beginning. I fear he'll share them and ruin my career. I had a nightmare last night that he had cameras in his bedroom and that he has videos too. I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR: My FWB took screenshots of my nudes without my consent. I asked him to delete them and he said no. I'm terrified he'll share them and ruin my career. What do I do?

*Note: I've changed the name to protect the OP's identity.

This post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users offering advice and support to the OP. Some common themes include:

* The importance of setting boundaries and communicating clearly with your partner about what you are and are not comfortable with.

* The importance of seeking support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist to help you process your emotions and develop a plan to deal with the situation.
* The need to consider reporting the incident to the authorities, such as the police or a cybercrime unit, if you feel that your privacy has been violated and you want to take legal action.

Some users have also offered practical advice, such as:

* Changing your phone number and email address to prevent Nick from contacting you.
* Reporting the incident to the app developers and asking them to take action against Nick's account.
* Considering a restraining order to prevent Nick from contacting you or sharing the photos.
* Seeking legal advice to explore your options for taking legal action against Nick.

Overall, the post has sparked a lively and supportive discussion about the importance of consent, boundaries, and safety in online relationships. Many users have expressed empathy and understanding for the OP's situation, and have offered words of encouragement and support.

TITLE: Guilt about loans: holding me back, or keeping me from being a moron (again)?

POST: I graduated college with no debt 5 years ago (majored in English Literature, mistake number one), then threw that all in the garbage by taking out a large student loan to start a graduate program I subsequently quit.

I have been working whatever part-time jobs come my way since then. I promised myself that if I ever go back to school, I would save up my money first and pay my own way because I felt so stupid about being in debt with this loan for no reason.

But I have recently decided what I want to do with my life. I want to go back to school to get started on this path, but my current job pays less than 10 dollars an hour and I can't imagine how long it would take to save up enough money to really get started.

Should I go ahead and take out loans to finance my education now that I know what I want to do? Or is my guilt and hesitancy about debt rational? I know I'm miserable right now, but nothing is guaranteed and I feel like I may just be setting myself up for more misery and even deeper debt down the road if I still can't find a decent job later on (I want to go back to school to become a teacher and I know sometimes it's difficult for new teachers to find work). I really can't see finding a stable decent job with the degree I already have. I'd appreciate any advice.

TL;DR: I'm considering going back to school to become a teacher, but I'm hesitant because of my past mistakes with debt. Should I take out loans to finance my education or is my guilt rational?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I also have a degree in English Lit and I'm currently working on my teaching certification. I took out loans to finance my education and it was the best decision I ever made. Don't let your guilt hold you back from pursuing your dreams. You're not a moron for taking out loans, you're taking a step towards a better future. Just make sure you're responsible with your finances and you'll be fine."
2. **TeacherTina**: "I'm a teacher and I can attest that it's a tough field to break into, but it's worth it. I didn't take out loans for my education, but I did have to take out a small loan to cover some living expenses while I was student teaching. It was a small price to pay for the education and experience I gained. If you're serious about becoming a teacher, I would say go for it. Just make sure you're prepared for the challenges that come with the job."
3. **FrugalFiona**: "OP, I'm not a teacher, but I am frugal and I think you should consider alternative options before taking out loans. Have you looked into scholarships, grants, or assistantships? These can help you finance your education without going into debt. Also, consider community colleges or online programs that may be more affordable. You can also look into teaching certification programs that are shorter and more affordable than traditional teaching programs."
4. **StudentSavvy**: "OP, I'm a student and I've been in your shoes before. I took out loans to finance my education and it was a huge mistake. I'm now stuck with a ton of debt and it's been a huge stress on my life. I would advise you to explore other options before taking out loans. Look into scholarships, grants, and assistantships. Also, consider community colleges or online programs that may be more affordable. You can also look into teaching certification programs that are shorter and more affordable than traditional teaching programs."
5. **RationalRuth**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You made a mistake in the past, but that doesn't mean you can't learn from it and move forward. Taking out loans to finance your education is a normal part of many people's lives. Just make sure you're responsible with your finances and you'll be fine. Don't let your guilt hold you back from pursuing your dreams."

TITLE: Me (25F) and my guy (25M) of 6 years are in a bit of a huge argument due to another girl who has caused problems before.

POST: Let's see my ex SO of 5 years and I have been trying to work things out, but there are some factors that pretty much scream RUN. It starts off during the middle of our relationship when he talked to this girl during us dating, it caused us to break up because I would constantly bitch to him about how its fucked up he is talking to another girl so much. It turn out that I was right in the end about them "talking". Well we got back together not too long after I found out, because he was begging and promising that he did not know what he was doing and that he would drop it and I was in a tough place because I lost someone(death). Well years have passed, and we had broken up again. This time he told me that he had liked her, months later we started to try and rekindle things and then I saw him talking to her again, but he claimed he was fighting with her because she was talking to a kid he did not like. I asked him why he cared so much, and he said it was because she was his friend and he despises the kid. Which I know it total bullshit, but yet we were still trying to work on things. After months have passed, we still are trying until he started hanging out at her house, and she has been attending parties at his with her boyfriend and all because they all have mutual friends. He will talk to her, and continue to hang with her and friends. This is all no problem since we are technically not together. The issue is he does not understand why I would not be with him if he was friends with her, and he thinks it would be okay to be friends with this girl if we did get back together. Can someone give me their opinion as to what you think about all that?

TL;DR: My guy of 6 years has been friends with this girl who caused problems in our relationship before. He doesn't understand why I wouldn't be with him if he's friends with her, and thinks it would be okay to be friends with her if we get back together.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not taking your feelings seriously and is prioritizing his own desires over your boundaries. It's not okay for him to hang out with this girl and expect you to be okay with it, especially after what happened in the past. You deserve better than someone who doesn't respect your boundaries and is willing to put you in a situation that could lead to more drama and hurt."
* "I think you should have a serious conversation with him about why you're uncomfortable with him being friends with this girl. It's not about being 'possessive' or 'jealous', it's about feeling disrespected and hurt by his actions. You need to communicate your feelings and boundaries clearly and assertively, and see if he's willing to work with you to find a solution that makes you both happy."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. It sounds like he's not willing to prioritize your feelings and boundaries, and that's a major red flag. You deserve someone who respects and values you, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that he's not aware of how his actions are affecting you, and a calm and respectful conversation could help clear the air. However, if he's not willing to listen and work with you to find a solution, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and consider whether it's truly healthy for you."

Overall, the comments are in agreement that the OP's boyfriend is not respecting her boundaries and is prioritizing his own desires over her feelings. Many commenters suggest that the OP should have a serious conversation with her boyfriend about her concerns and boundaries, and that if he's not willing to work with her to find a solution, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship. Some commenters also suggest that the OP should prioritize her own happiness and well-being, and consider whether the relationship is truly healthy for her.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my bf [24M] of 2 years are having issues because of my personal problems

POST: I have a history of ending relationships out of nowhere. I'm not entirely sure why besides that I just get scared of the commitment that comes with long term relationships.

As of recently, I have just been feeling really not myself. I have good days and I have bad days where I feel really low. On the good days I'm convinced that I'm just being weird and that it will pass. On bad days I feel really negative and agitated.

As of recently the low days are outnumbering the good days. I feel very irritable and I feel so bad for how my bf has to deal with it. I sometimes don't feel like being touched. He is so loving and just wants to be near me and snuggle all the time but it just makes me push him away and get agitated. The more I push the more he tries to fix it and by being more loving.

I have zero sex drive and I end up declining his advances because I never feel up to it. We talked last night and he said he feels like I don't care about him as much anymore. That broke my heart because i feel absolutely terrible with how I have been treating him.. being distant and not wanting to have sex. And I know he has to feel that way based off of how I act but I am having a hard time dictating how I feel and why.

I don't think it is the relationship unless I just don't like being smothered with attention but it feels more than that. I quit my recent job because it was too emotionally draining and I feel like I want something but I just can't put my finger on what.

TL;DR: I'm having a hard time with my personal problems and it's affecting my relationship. I'm feeling irritable, distant, and uninterested in sex. I don't know why I'm feeling this way and I'm scared that I'm going to end up pushing my bf away.

TITLE: I [23M] am seeing a girl [20F] unlike any girl I've ever seen before.

POST: I met a girl on OKCupid. We met up, clicked, and have been out around 10 times together now. We both live at our respective homes, me as I pay off my student loans, whereas she is a commuter at her university. 

We've expressed multiple times how it would be great to actually finish a date and spend the night together but sadly it just hasn't happened yet. We are exclusively seeing one another and I'm very happy.  

I am in a situation I've never been in before, as she is a very independent girl and I'm used to ones that are more communicative and open with what they are feeling and doing. I have a hard time trying to figure out what is going on in her mind. Because of this, I'm not sure if I'm being too distant or too clingy when I message her or see her. 

Can anyone else who has been in this situation before, shed some light on what they did to put themselves at ease while seeing someone independent? I like this girl a lot but don't want to scare her off by encroaching on her "me" time.

TL;DR: I'm seeing a girl who is very independent and I'm having trouble figuring out what's going on in her mind. I'm worried about being too distant or too clingy. Has anyone else been in this situation before and have any advice on how to navigate it?

COMMENTS:

* "I've been in a similar situation before. What I did was to focus on the things we had in common and the things we enjoyed doing together. I didn't try to read too much into her actions or words, and I just let her be herself. I also made sure to respect her boundaries and not push her to talk about things she wasn't comfortable with. It's okay if you don't know everything about her, just be yourself and let the relationship unfold naturally."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and don't try to change who you are to fit her mold. If she's independent, that's okay, but it doesn't mean she doesn't want to connect with you. Just be open and honest with her and let her know how you're feeling. If she's not interested in talking about things, that's okay too. Just respect her boundaries and don't push the issue."
* "I've been in a relationship with someone who is very independent and it's actually been really great. They're not clingy or needy, and they let me have my own space. I think it's great that you're acknowledging her independence and respecting her boundaries. Just keep being yourself and don't try to change who you are to fit her mold. If it's meant to be, it will be."
* "I think you're being too focused on her independence and not enough on your own feelings. What do you want from this relationship? What are your needs and desires? Make sure you're communicating those to her and not just trying to figure out what she's thinking. Remember, relationships are a two-way street, and it's okay if you don't have all the answers."
* "I've been in a similar situation before and I think it's great that you're acknowledging her independence. Just remember that it's okay if you don't know everything about her, and it's okay if she doesn't know everything about you. Just be open and honest with each other and let the relationship unfold naturally. Don't try to change who you are to fit her mold, and don't try to read too much into her actions or words.

TITLE: (M/17) How to let go of a shitty friend (F/15)?

POST: I been friends with this cute girl for about a  2 years now. Although I am somewhat a little romantically in love with her (we hold hands, cuddle at home, give light kisses to each other but not  in the lips), I still get jealous when she hangs around with guys and does stuff without me. Although I care for her deeply.

So far she's been doing stuff that I don't agree with which includes doing illegal drugs, drinking alcohol excessively, having sex with other girls, and hanging out with the wrong type of people like the druggie, gang-banger, shady type of people. I feel like telling her parents or reporting her to the police for drug possession so that she can stop endangering herself with these type of people, since she is and acts far too young to be doing all this.

Even though she is one of my best friends and I tell her to stop doing these things but she goes on how I'm being a too much of a "goody goody" in her words, I no longer want to be associated with this type of person, but I cannot help my self to break contact with her since I see her everyday at school, we talk almost everyday, she lives near me, and she is the closest I ever had to a girlfriend. 

What can I do to ensure that I can successfully break away from her? And should I tell her parents about his?

TL;DR: I'm 17, been friends with a 15-year-old girl for 2 years. She's doing illegal drugs, drinking excessively, having sex with other girls, and hanging out with shady people. I'm jealous and worried about her safety. I want to break away from her but it's hard since we're close. Should I tell her parents or report her to the police?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to prioritize your own well-being and safety. It's not healthy to be in a situation where you're constantly worried about your friend's actions and feeling jealous. You deserve better than that. Take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit."
* "I agree with the previous comment. You need to set boundaries and prioritize your own life. It's not your responsibility to fix your friend's problems or to be her guardian. You can't control her actions, but you can control how you react to them."
* "I think you should talk to your friend about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her actions are having on you and others. But if she's not willing to listen or change, then it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
* "I don't think you should tell her parents or report her to the police. That's not your decision to make. You can't control her actions, and it's not your responsibility to fix her problems. You can only control how you react to them."
* "I think you should take a break from the friendship and focus on yourself for a bit. It's okay to take a step back and reevaluate the friendship. You deserve to be around people who uplift and support you, not people who are putting you down or making you feel bad about yourself."
* "I agree with the previous comment. You need to prioritize your own well-being and safety. It's not healthy to be in a situation where you're constantly worried about your friend's actions and feeling jealous. You deserve better than that. Take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit."

TITLE: My girlfriends Bday is coming up. I have access to a 3D printer. IDEAS!?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months and her b-day is coming up. I'd like to do something special for her. It's been a huge struggle to figure out what to buy/make for her as a present because she literally doesn't want ANYTHING. She is a very charitable person and is always looking into volunteering and donating. At first I was thinking of donating to a charity/organization of her choice, but I decided that I actually want to do something instead (or maybe along with donating). I have access to a 3D printer that my buddy owns so I was thinking of making something using that. However there are a couple of problems which is why I am making my plea to you redditors!

1) I have no artistic capabilities and can not graphically design anything. Thus it must be something that already exists (for example things from thingiverse.com) (Or if one of you amazing redditors can make me something that would be beyond amazing!)

2) I want it to be thoughtful and a tiny bit cheesy, but something that tailors to her charitable, nice, intelligent traits.

3) I have about 20 days to make and paint whatever object I decide upon.

Here are a few ideas I saw on thingiverse.com that caught my eye:
[Heart and Key](

[Nice Bracelet](

[Twisty Bracelet](

I looked around for a good subreddit for this and I feel like this is somewhat of a thought-provoking question, hence why I posted it here.

TL;DR: I'm looking for ideas on what to make for my girlfriend's birthday using a 3D printer. She's charitable, nice, and intelligent. I have no design skills and need something that already exists. I want it to be thoughtful and a bit cheesy. I have 20 days to make and paint it.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my close friend [31 F] became intimate but now things are awkward.

POST: So I have been in a serious long term relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend and by serious I mean I am thinking about proposing within the next year.  However, about 2 years ago I met a really amazing girl, lets call her C.  C and I have been getting closer - we text regularly, are able to make fun of each other like I do with my bros, and we usually go out for drinks at least once a week (i let my gf know this of course).  We really connect as we have the same career (finance) and she is one of the more interesting individuals i have ever met and understands me (very few people do as I think I am quite complicated).  Anyways, the other night we went out for drinks and ended up at her place.  We had a few more drinks and we end up making out - this was one of the most passionate make-out sessions I've had in a long time.  The next morning, we sober up a bit and now things are a bit awkward and I feel like shit for cheating.  She says to me that if I have no intention of being with her, its best that we don't see each other anymore. She's out of town for the weekend as she has family matters to attend to and we will talk when she's back.  

I know this is selfish but I don't want to lose C as a friend and also don't want to break up with my current gf.  I'm aware that it's not fair to C but it feels like my best friend just suddenly died.  I'm not sure which direction to go ie 

1) break up, date C

2) Never talk or see C again

3) Do shit all and go with the flow

Any advice on what to say when I meet up with C or advice on what to do is appreciated, thanks.

TL;DR: I had a one-night stand with my close friend C, who I've been getting close to for 2 years. Now things are awkward and I'm torn between breaking up with my current girlfriend and pursuing a relationship with C, or cutting ties with C and staying in my current relationship. Help!

You need to own up to your actions and be honest with her about your intentions. If you're not interested in pursuing a relationship with her, then you need to be upfront and respectful about it."

* "I think you should take some time to reflect on your actions and your feelings. You're clearly torn between two people, and that's not a healthy or sustainable situation. You need to figure out what you want and what's best for you, and then be honest with others about your intentions."

TITLE: I (27 F) shed a lot of hair and my boyfriend (37 F) wants me to pick up every single one of them in the bathroom each time.

POST: If you ever lived with a girl before or you are one, you should know that girls shed a lot and their loose strands can be found pretty much anywhere in the house. 

Understandably, my boyfriend gets incredibly annoyed that he finds so many of them in our bathroom. So now, every time I'm in the bathroom, I always make sure to pick a bunch of my loose hair on the ground and then throw it away. I also brush my hair daily to make sure that I can catch the loose hair before they drop to the ground.

I don't manage to pick up each and every loose strand in the bathroom and that's what he finds unacceptable. The bathroom floor has to be completely free of my hair but the problem is I shed a lot and so often that I can't be spending all of my time cleaning up all my hairs.

Is he being unreasonable?

TL;DR: I shed a lot of hair and my boyfriend wants me to pick up every single one of them in the bathroom each time. I don't think it's possible and it's taking up a lot of my time.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's reasonable to pick up the majority of your hair, but it's not feasible to pick up every single one. Maybe you can compromise and do a quick sweep of the floor after brushing your hair?"
* "I'm a girl and I shed a lot too. I understand where you're coming from. Maybe you can explain to your boyfriend that it's not possible to pick up every single strand and that you're doing your best to keep the bathroom clean?"
* "I think it's a bit unreasonable to expect you to pick up every single strand. Maybe your boyfriend should just get used to seeing a few stray hairs on the floor?"
* "I'm a guy and I have to say, it's not that big of a deal. You're not leaving a trail of hair everywhere you go, are you?"
* "I think you should have a conversation with your boyfriend about this. Maybe he's feeling anxious or stressed about the hair and you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."

**Conclusion:** The majority of commenters agree that it's not feasible to pick up every single strand of hair and that a compromise or conversation with the boyfriend is necessary to find a solution that works for both parties. Some commenters also offer words of encouragement and understanding, acknowledging that shedding hair is a natural part of being a woman. Overall, the post sparks a discussion about the importance of communication and compromise in relationships.

TITLE: Hey, Reddit, I feel like I have a lot of repressed and most likely misplaced anger towards female gamers/nerds. People who may feel similar, do you consciously know why?

POST: Obviously, it can't be all that repressed if I'm making a thread about it right now. The anonymity helps me to speak about it more openly, I believe.

From that Nerdy Nummies chick on YouTube to pretty much 90% of the women I've raided with in WoW. Even the woman that I play with in league and know IRL irritate me greatly, even though I'd never admit it out loud.

The only motive I can think up that would make me so upset is that they are applauded for embracing their "geekdom" while most males are criticized. Which is pretty stupid since I like women and playing with them should be enjoyable. They tend to have pleasing voices and be more willing to play support roles(100% personal experience).

TL;DR: I have repressed anger towards female gamers/nerds. I don't know why, but it's there. Anyone else feel the same way?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's because you're comparing yourself to them and feeling like you're not good enough. Maybe you're feeling like you're not 'nerdy' enough or that you're not as good at games as they are. It's not about them, it's about your own insecurities."
* "I've noticed that a lot of guys get upset when women start to get good at games. It's like they're trying to take away their'spot' or something. It's ridiculous, but it's a thing."
* "I think it's because you're feeling threatened by their presence. You're used to being the only 'nerd' in the room, and now you're being challenged by women who are just as into it as you are. It's uncomfortable for you, so you lash out."
* "I've had similar feelings, but I've realized that it's because I'm a dude who's been socialized to think that women don't belong in gaming. It's a stupid, outdated idea, and I'm working to change my own biases. You can do the same."
* "I think it's because you're not used to being around women who are confident and assertive. You're used to being around women who are more submissive and quiet. It's uncomfortable for you, so you get upset."
* "I've noticed that a lot of guys get upset when women start to get good at games because they're worried that they'll lose their 'edge' or their'status' as a gamer. It's like they're trying to protect their own ego, rather than just enjoying the game."
* "I think it's because you're feeling like you're being judged or criticized by these women. You're used to being the one who's in control, and now you're being challenged by women who are just as good as you are. It's uncomfortable for you, so you lash out."
* "I've had similar feelings, but I've realized that it's because I'm a dude who's been socialized to think that women don't belong in gaming. It's a stupid, outdated idea, and I'm working to change my own biases. You can do the same."
* "I think it's because you're not used to being around women who are confident and assertive. You're used to being around women who are more submissive and quiet. It's uncomfortable for you, so you get upset."

This post and the comments that follow highlight the common theme of repressed anger towards female gamers/nerds. The OP (original poster) is struggling to understand why they feel this way, and the commenters offer various insights and perspectives. Some commenters suggest that the OP's anger may be rooted in feelings of insecurity, competition, or discomfort with the presence of confident and assertive women in gaming. Others suggest that the OP may be holding onto outdated biases and stereotypes about women's roles in gaming. Overall, the conversation encourages self-reflection and challenges the OP to consider the possibility that their anger may be misguided and rooted in their own biases.

TITLE: I [29 M] don't think I'm falling in love with my [28 F] new gf, same as last time. Worried I've got a pattern

POST: Been seeing this girl for about a month, but we're not committed because I told her I'm not ready. She wants to be in a committed relationship. 

She's had enough experience to know she won't have sex until then, which is okay with me (though not how I usually do it). 

We have a lot in common: get along, have similar interests, etc. She's pretty cute and just finished grad school. I guess she fits the bill.

But I'm just not that excited about it. Lukewarm.

Back in January I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months for the same reason, and a year ago I did the same with a girl of 2 months. All 3 girls wanted to keep dating me. 

There have been a few girls I've been excited about after a date or two, but they weren't that into me.

I'm afraid I'm victim to the old Groucho Marx quote, "I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member."

These girls are catches and I'm beating myself up for not being that into them.

Maybe this is normal and just called dating. Should I break up with current girl right now? 

Do I just need to be patient and wait for feelings to build? That didn't work last time.

Should I just be patient and hold out until a girl knocks my socks off? I think I've really gotta "fall" for them. But maybe my standards are too high.

TL;DR: I'm 29, dating a 28-year-old girl, but I'm not feeling the love. Same pattern as last time. Worried I'm doing something wrong. Should I break up with her or be patient?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to not feel an instant connection with someone. Give it time, and see if things develop naturally. Don't put too much pressure on yourself."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "It sounds like you're looking for a strong emotional connection, which is great! But maybe you're expecting it to happen too quickly. Take your time, and focus on building a strong foundation with your girlfriend. Communication, trust, and shared values are important too."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I think you're trying to force something that isn't meant to be. If you're not feeling it, it's okay to acknowledge that and move on. You don't have to stay in a relationship just because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you're being too focused on the 'falling in love' aspect. Relationships are about building a life together, sharing experiences, and growing as individuals. Maybe you're just not ready for that level of commitment yet. Take your time, and see where things go."
5. **u/realistic_rachel**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to 'fall' for someone. Relationships are about compromise, communication, and mutual respect. Maybe you're just not compatible with these girls, and that's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself, and focus on finding someone who makes you happy."

**Conclusion:** The comments suggest that the OP is being too hard on himself and should focus on building a strong foundation with his girlfriend rather than expecting an instant emotional connection. They also advise him to take his time, communicate openly, and focus on shared values and interests. Some commenters suggest that it's okay to acknowledge that he's not feeling it and move on, while others encourage him to be patient and see where things go. Ultimately, the OP should prioritize his own happiness and well-being in his relationships.

TITLE: My [24M] gf [20F] sent me a really cryptic message about something she wants to talk about, but won't talk right now

POST: I'm currently long distance with my gf for about two months since she's interning elsewhere. Last Friday I went to a workshop in another city (and am still here), and I noticed she just ceased all communication over the weekend. I sent her some messages asking what's going on, and she finally responded last night with the following sequence of messages.

her: Ill talk to u when u get back from dc

me: huh why

her: I have something i want to talk to u about but not while youre there so ill wait for u to come back first

me: i can Skype you now

her: No, ill talk to u when youre back

me: why does it matter where I'm at

her: Oh, didnt see this
Ill just talk to u when u get back, i dont want to talk about it right now

me: you said that already

her: I dont have anything else to say atm

I'm going back home in two days (to my place, not where she's currently at), but I can't stop thinking about this today, and it's distracting me from other things. I don't really want to press her further if she's unwilling to talk, but on the other hand I need a better understanding of what's going on right now.. if someone can help me decipher the cryptic messages she sent, it would be much appreciated.

We've been apart for nearing two months now but I have a flight to visit her in a little under two weeks.

TL;DR: GF sent me cryptic messages saying she wants to talk about something but won't talk until I get back from my trip. I'm worried and want to understand what's going on.

TITLE: Deep physical and emotional connection...but we don't want a relationship? Can someone explain?

POST: I (male, 26) have a very good friend (female, 25) that I've recently gotten much closer to. Over the past month and a half or so we've come to realize that we are able to communicate and understand each other on a deeper level than with anyone else. We are incredibly similar, in all of the ways that truly matter. We see each other usually a few times a week, and talk every day, for most of the day, including at night for several hours. 
We're also both physically attracted to one another, but she is just coming off of a breakup with a long term partner, and I am recently divorced, so we don't want to do anything with one another right now. But the desire is there.

The thing is, though, that we both agree...we don't feel like we want to be in a romantic relationship with one another. We don't want to "date". It seems...weird to us. 

So my question is, what is this relationship? If we get along so well, have such a profound connection, spend so much time together, and are physically attracted to each other, why do we not feel like we want to date each other?

TL;DR: I have a deep connection with a friend who I'm physically attracted to, but we both don't want to date. What is this relationship?

---

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're experiencing a deep friendship, which is amazing! You're not obligated to label it or try to make it into something it's not. Enjoy the connection and the time you spend together, and don't worry about what others might think."
* "I think you're both being very honest with yourselves about not being ready for a romantic relationship. It's okay to acknowledge that attraction and still choose not to act on it. You can still maintain a strong friendship and respect each other's boundaries."
* "It's possible that you're both feeling a sense of comfort and security with each other, which is a great foundation for a friendship. You don't need to put pressure on it to be something more. Just enjoy the connection and the time you spend together."
* "I think you're both being very mature about this. It's not always easy to acknowledge attraction and choose not to act on it, but it sounds like you're both prioritizing your own emotional readiness and well-being. That's really admirable."
* "It's also possible that you're both feeling a sense of familiarity and comfort with each other, which can make it feel like you're already in a relationship, even if you're not romantically involved. That's okay! You can still have a deep connection without being in a romantic relationship."

TITLE: Things to do in Vienna?

POST: In end of September or start of October girlfriend and I are going to Vienna. My cousin has a flat there so accommodation is taken care of as well as transport (train). Thing is I really don't know what is there to see apart form Madame Tussaud, Prater and Starbucks which girlfriend insists we go there (there are non in my country). Heard also something about the Zoo, is it worth it? We are planing on 5 day stay and we want to cover as much city as possible so if any one can list a local website for public transport that would be great or any info sites(aside of vienna info) Apart from all the sights any good restaurants near the center (or main train station as the flat is somewhere near) or any local pubs where young people like to gather? If any one can list a bit ''less tourist-y'' locations or less known yet still interesting it would be also great. 
I don't speak German well, is it possible to communicate with locals in English? Girlfriend does speak German but I'd like to participate in talking. And what are prices in general there?

TL;DR: Planning a 5-day trip to Vienna with my girlfriend. Looking for recommendations on what to see, do, and eat. Also, tips on communicating with locals, prices, and less touristy areas.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/AustrianNative**: Ah, Vienna is a wonderful city! You're in luck because the city has a lot to offer. Here are some must-see attractions:

* Schönbrunn Palace: A former imperial summer residence with beautiful gardens.
* St. Stephen's Cathedral: A stunning Gothic cathedral in the heart of the city.
* Hofburg Palace: The former principal imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty.
* MuseumsQuartier: A complex of museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Natural History.
* Naschmarkt: A bustling market with food stalls and shops.

For public transport, you can use the Vienna public transport website (Wiener Linien) or the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) website. Both have English options.

As for restaurants, I recommend trying some traditional Viennese cuisine like Wiener Schnitzel or Sacher Torte. Some popular spots near the city center include:

* Griechenbeisl: A historic restaurant serving traditional Viennese dishes.
* Zum Schwarzen Kameel: A cozy restaurant with a rustic atmosphere.
* Café Central: A grand café with a beautiful interior.

For local pubs, try:

* Augustiner-Keller: A traditional Viennese beer hall.
* Praterstern: A lively square with bars and clubs.
* Schwarzes Kameel: A cozy pub with a relaxed atmosphere.

Don't worry about communicating with locals; many Viennese speak English, especially among the younger population. However, it's always helpful to learn a few basic German phrases, like "Danke" (thank you) and "Bitte" (please).

Prices in Vienna are generally reasonable, but you can expect to pay a bit more for food and drinks in tourist areas. A meal at a mid-range restaurant will cost around €20-€30 per person.

For less touristy areas, try exploring the neighborhoods of:

* Margareten: A trendy neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings.
* Leopoldstadt: A charming neighborhood with a mix of bars, restaurants, and shops.
* Favoriten: A multicultural neighborhood with a mix of international cuisine and shops.

2. **u/Traveler88**: Hi there! I'm a frequent visitor to Vienna, and I'd be happy to share some of my favorite spots with you.

Firstly, I recommend exploring the city's many museums. The Kunsthistorisches Museum is a must-visit, with an incredible collection of art and artifacts from around the world. The Naturhistorisches Museum is also worth a visit, with its stunning collection of natural history specimens and artifacts.

For food, I recommend trying some of the city's many traditional Viennese restaurants. Some of my favorites include:

* Zum Schwarzen Kameel: A cozy restaurant with a rustic atmosphere and delicious food.

3. **u/LocalGuide**: Hi there! I'm a local guide in Vienna, and I'd be happy to share some of my favorite spots with you.

Firstly, I recommend exploring the city's many parks and gardens. The Burggarten is a beautiful park with a stunning palace and a peaceful atmosphere. The Prater Park is also worth a visit, with its stunning views of the city and its many walking trails.

* Griechenbeisl: A historic restaurant serving traditional Viennese dishes.
* Café Central: A grand café with a beautiful interior and delicious pastries.

For local pubs, try:

* Augustiner-Keller: A traditional Viennese beer hall with a lively atmosphere.
* Praterstern: A lively square with bars and clubs.
* Schwarzes Kameel: A cozy pub with a

TITLE: Me [mid twenties/F] with my overseas family--is it okay if I don't make initiative anymore now that several months have passed by since I last saw them?

POST: I love them dearly and our family is very close despite the distance, but because of my headspace (ADHD and past history with PTSD and anxiety) several months later, I don't feel connected like I used to because I haven't seen them for such a long time and my memories have drastically faded since it's been half a year now.  

I used to reach out a lot, but now I don't feel the need to reach out at all.  Is it okay if I don't make the initiative with them anymore now that several months have passed by since I last saw them?  I'll probably see them again in less than a year.  I don't want it to seem like I'm upset at them or anything, I just feel like my 'needs' have changed.

TL;DR: I haven't seen my overseas family in several months and my memories have faded.  I used to make the initiative to stay in touch, but now I don't feel the need to.  Is it okay if I don't make the initiative anymore until I see them again in less than a year?

TITLE: I[18F] do not know what to do with my boyfriend[20M] of a year and a half, with him going away for school.

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. And everything is perfectly fine. We have a great relationship with no problems, never broke up. We're really happy!  

He's a junior in college and I'm a freshman in college, I commute to a local university and he went away to school then came back  commuted to a community college for a year and now he recently got into a university where he has to go away again. We talked about it and I was really upset but I understand it's what he has to do. 

It's not even distance will be the problem, it's not that far away at all, Problem is, is that he's never been single going in college and wants to try it out. He's been in relationships starting from like his sophomore year of high school. He dated a girl for 6 months, then dated a girl for 2 years, and then met me right after and we instantly clicked. But on the other hand he said really loves being with me and what we have is really good! 

He doesn't know what to do. I do not know what to do.  He knows if he breaks up with me it will probably never be the same and that he will miss me, but he's telling me that he's so unsure it's eating him up. He said he kind of wants to realize he needs me by being away but I really want to stay together and see how it works out and then decide. He leaves in a week. What do you guys think we should do? Anyone have any similar stories or went through the same thing? Opinions?

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 1.5 years is going away for school and wants to try being single for a bit. He loves me but is unsure and doesn't know what to do. I want to stay together and figure it out. What do you guys think we should do?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's trying to figure out if he's truly in love with you or if he's just comfortable with the relationship. If he's unsure, it's probably best to give him space and let him figure it out. You deserve someone who is 100% sure about their feelings for you. If he comes back and realizes he misses you and wants to be with you, then you can re-evaluate your relationship. But if he doesn't, it might be time to move on."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I think it's great that he's being honest with you about his feelings. It takes a lot of courage to admit uncertainty. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and what you want. Let him know that you value your relationship and that you're willing to work through this together. But also make it clear that you need to feel secure in your relationship and that you won't be okay with being strung along or used as a 'test' to see if he can be single. If he's willing to work through this with you and be honest about his feelings, then it might be worth giving it a shot. But if he's not willing to commit to your relationship, then it might be time to re-evaluate."
3. **BeenThereDoneThat**: "I went through something similar with my ex. He wanted to take a break and figure out what he wanted. It was hard, but I gave him space and let him figure it out. In the end, he realized he missed me and wanted to be with me, and we ended up getting back together. But if he doesn't come back and realize he misses you, it might be time to move on. You deserve someone who is 100% sure about their feelings for you."
4. **RelationshipCoach**: "I think it's great that you're having this conversation with your boyfriend. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about your feelings and to have an open and honest conversation about what you want. I would suggest having a conversation with him about what you want and what you need from your relationship. Let him know that you value your relationship and that you're willing to work through this together.

TITLE: I [25 F] went out with this guy[25 M] and now I fell in love with him..

POST: We're known each other from the internet for 7 years, exchanged pics, talked a lot in the past on the internet, liked each other a lot, but in the last 2 years, none of us kept in touch. 

We work in different cities, 6-7 hours car distance. 

A few months ago, my job offered me the opportunity to work in his city, for 5 months. One week before I left, I contacted him and asked him out; he didn't know I was there. He accepted and we stayed like 6 hours to talk without any sexual or romantic topic. 

At the end of the "date" he asked me when I'm coming back and he said that "now you have my number, you can call me at any time". And I told him that maybe we will see each other again and he said "of course we will" and that's it, he hadn't contacted me since and I don't know if I shoud do it, but I dont wanna push things... 

Now a little of myself: I'm recently out of a 5 year relationship and planned to relocate in that city and I feel stuck with this guy in my mind, because he is as I always known him: smart, interesting, people person, handsome etc. 

The relocation means professional oportunities for me, but I'm not sure my boss will let me go and lately I also consider relocation for this guy but when I try to conclude things, I get extremely confused because I'm not sure he likes me more than an old internet buddy

TL;DR: I went out with this guy I've known online for 7 years, and now I'm in love with him. We had a nice time, but he hasn't contacted me since. I'm stuck and unsure if I should reach out or not.

**Comments:**

* "I think you should give him some space. You guys had a nice time, but he didn't make any effort to keep in touch after that. If he's interested, he'll make an effort to reach out. Don't put too much pressure on yourself."
* "I agree with the above comment. You guys had a nice time, but it's not like you had a deep emotional connection or anything. He might just be being friendly. Don't get your hopes up too high."
* "I think you should try to reach out to him and see how he feels. You guys have a history and it's not like you just met. But don't be too pushy or clingy. Just casually ask him how he's doing and see if there's any interest on his part."
* "I think you should focus on yourself and your own feelings. You're recently out of a 5 year relationship and you're considering relocating. Make sure you're doing what's best for you and not just trying to get someone to fill a void. Take your time and figure out what you want."
* "I think you should try to talk to him about how you're feeling. Be honest and open with him. If he's not interested, then at least you'll know and can move on. But if he is interested, then you can take things to the next level. Just be prepared for any outcome."
* "I think you should give him some time to process his feelings. You guys had a nice time, but it's not like you had a deep emotional connection or anything. He might just be taking some time to figure out how he feels. Don't be too hard on yourself and just focus on your own feelings and what you want."



**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thank you all for your comments! I think I will take your advice and give him some space. I don't want to put too much pressure on myself or him. I will focus on my own feelings and what I want. And if he reaches out, that's great, but if not, I'll be okay with that too. Thanks again for your input!"



**Conclusion:**

The original poster is struggling with her feelings for this guy she's known online for 7 years. They had a nice time when they met in person, but he hasn't contacted her since. She's unsure if she should reach out to him or not, and is seeking advice from the Reddit community. The comments are generally advising her to give him some space, focus on her own feelings, and not put too much pressure on herself or him. The original poster decides to take their advice and focus on her own feelings and what she wants, and is prepared to accept whatever outcome may come from her decision.

TITLE: I [24M] am afraid to become over-attached to [22F]

POST: We have dated for 5 month now and she is my official GF for 1,5month and I am afraid I might get over-attached and that I am turning into someone I do not want to be. One example, an old-highschool friend visited her and they went out partying (I went somewhere else) and he spent the night at her place (we dont live together and he doesnt live close). I am totally okay with that and I know that since she only has one huge bed and no couch that he slept in one bed with her. I trust her and I know that she would never cheat on me but still I become paranoid. She accidentally called me by his name today (and she was so embarrassed and sorry) and that freaked me the fuck out. I know that she loves me a lot and she told me that she never felt that much in love before and I believe her. Why do I still become paranoid? I couldnt sleep tonight because I was creating scenarios in my head in which she cheated on me or something else bad happened.

Do I have self-esteem issues or something?

I am someone who needs a lot of freedom in relationships. If I wanted to visit a female friend and platonically spend the night and I couldn't because my GF wouldnt let me, I would be so annoyed, so it seems just natural to me to give her the same freedom I am expecting of her but why can't I just be cooler about this? It feels like my emotional shields protecting me from my own paranoia are completely shut down. It feels a little like I am tripping out on MDMA or something.

TL;DR: I am afraid of becoming over-attached to my GF and I am becoming paranoid about her interactions with other people, even though I trust her. I am someone who values freedom in relationships and I am struggling to be cool about this.

TITLE: Mediocre problem with my "girlfriend" or whatever you may call it.

POST: So.. this seems like a very mediocre problem but it has been bothering me for the longest time.

1. We've been together for about four months. 
2. She isn't my girlfriend. She says she doesn't like the title of being a girlfriend and that her first boyfriend was awful. So she was only "dating" the previous "boyfriends" she has had. (So technically she has only had 1 boyfriend and the other guys were just relationships)
3. She never has time or makes the time (She says she's incredibly busy). We probably hang out about every two weeks unless I push hard for some time to hang out. 
4. I don't know what else. She's someone I thought I would actually like and it kind of just happened. Before, she used to think I was this cool, super outgoing person (things she said before I had an interest in her) while she was this super shy girl (who actually seemed to waver on the social side). But now I'm interested in her in ways I never would've thought because of her personality and her drive and how different and unique she is to just about any other girl I have ever dated. 
5. I'm also afraid that maybe we moved too fast. Was sex on first date bad? Did it make it so it becomes hard to build a relationship since there was no tension building up on it?
6. She has never introduced me to anybody and shoos me out whenever she is expecting anybody. 
*I just want to build that she is the type that spent her life alone from middle school to high school. Would this be the reason she treats me so? 
7. Am I just a fuck buddy to her?

The real question I'm asking is whether she isn't making the time for me because she genuinely doesn't have an interest for me and I should end the relationship or make some kind of ultimatum. Or if it is because she really is busy and really doesn't expect much time out of our relationship but she actually does hold an interest. We also live only about 3 blocks away from each other.

TL;DR: Mediocre problem with my "girlfriend" or whatever you may call it. We've been together for 4 months, she's never made time for me, and I'm unsure if she's genuinely interested or just using me as a fuck buddy. Should I end the relationship or make an ultimatum?

**Top Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not a girlfriend, you're a 'whatever you may call it' because she's not committed to being in a relationship with you. If she's not making time for you, it's because she's not prioritizing you. You deserve better than someone who doesn't make an effort to spend time with you. End it and move on."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She's just busy, and you're not a priority to her. If you're not getting the attention you want, it's time to reevaluate the relationship. You can't force someone to make time for you, and it's not healthy to keep waiting around for someone who doesn't seem to care."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You said she's unique and different, and you're attracted to her personality and drive. Maybe she's just not used to having someone interested in her, and she's not sure how to handle it. Give her some space and see if she comes around. If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate."
* "You're not a fuck buddy, you're just not a priority to her. If you're not getting the attention you want, it's time to end it. You deserve someone who wants to spend time with you and make an effort to be in a relationship with you."
* "I think you're being too focused on the sex aspect. Just because you had sex on the first date doesn't mean it's the reason she's not making time for you. Maybe she's just not used to being in a relationship, and she's still figuring things out. Give her some space and see if she comes around. If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate."

**Community Insights:**

* The community is divided on whether the OP should end the relationship or give her space to see if she comes around.
* Many users agree that if she's not making time for the OP, it's likely because she's not prioritizing the relationship.
* Some users suggest that the OP should communicate his feelings and needs to her, but others advise against it, saying it may lead to more conflict.
* The community is generally skeptical of the OP's assumption that she might be using him as a fuck buddy, and suggests that he should focus on building a connection with her rather than making assumptions.

TITLE: My girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months is scared that i [22 M], might cheat on her!

POST: My girlfriend is in another country for a few months and she is scared whenever i go out that i might cheat on her with someone. I love her a lot and i would never even think about doing such thing, i'm always telling her where im going, we are texting basically 24/7 and video chatting etc. I sometimes send her pictures from the places i go to and the people i am with. 

But today she told me that whenever i go out she is thinking that i might cheat on her. I told her that her insecurity might cause problems in the future. I don't know why she would think like this, i would do everything for this girl. 
I asked her if in the past releationship someone cheated on her, but she said no, but who knows what happened right? Maybe she was the one cheating and now she is worried that it will come back to her or something... Any ideas on how to solve this problem?

TL;DR: Girlfriend is scared that i might cheat on her, even though we are in a long distance relationship and we are keeping in touch 24/7. I told her that her insecurity might cause problems in the future, but she is still worried.

---

This post is a great example of how a relationship can be affected by trust issues and insecurity. The OP (original poster) is frustrated because his girlfriend is constantly worried that he might cheat on her, even though they are in a long distance relationship and they are keeping in touch regularly. The OP feels that his girlfriend's insecurity is causing problems in their relationship and is worried that it might lead to future issues.

The OP's girlfriend's behavior is likely caused by a combination of factors, including her own past experiences, her feelings of vulnerability in the relationship, and her fear of being hurt again. It's possible that she has had past relationships where she felt betrayed or cheated on, which has led to her current level of insecurity.

The OP's response to his girlfriend's concerns is not helpful, as he is essentially telling her that her feelings are irrational and that she is being too insecure. This can come across as dismissive and unempathetic, which may exacerbate the problem.

A more effective approach would be for the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about her concerns. He could ask her to share more about what is driving her fears and listen to her perspective without becoming defensive or dismissive. He could also try to reassure her that he is committed to their relationship and that he would never cheat on her.

Ultimately, the key to resolving this issue is for the OP and his girlfriend to have a open and honest conversation about their feelings and concerns. They need to work together to build trust and understanding, and to find ways to address the underlying issues that are causing her insecurity. With effort and commitment, they can work through this issue and strengthen their relationship.

TITLE: [25/m] Enamored of my best friend's sister [21/f]

POST: Using a throwaway just to be safe. Mostly.

I've known one of my friends for around 10 years, and though we no longer live near each other, I make an effort to spend time with her a few times a year. She's practically a sister to me. In that time I've become close to her family, including one of her sisters, let's call her Olivia.

Olivia may or may not have been fond of me for some time. In recent years, my friend sent me teasing texts like, "When are you visiting again? Olivia misses you." At the time, I liked Olivia as much as one likes any annoying-but-somehow-endearing younger sisters of your best friend, so I rolled my eyes and humored her. I figured it was a phase, and it probably was.

Well, as it happens, I hate myself; Olivia has grown on me. After teasing Olivia through her college years for being in a related discipline embroiled in a conflict with my own, she switched to my major. Funny, that. Having the ability to share in obtuse conversations certainly enabled us to spend more time together, and I find myself stupidly grinning at even the worst of her puns.

Fast forward to the present. Olivia and I are both graduating in the spring. Part of me knows that keeping my mouth shut is the safer course of action, and much of this could just be me projecting, but I still want to open up to my friend before we all part ways. I'm trying to conceive how best to broach the topic with her, as it's going to be awkward regardless. I know all the risks involved, and I even considered the cataclysmic scenario in which it's my friend and not her sister who has feelings for me, which is ridiculous, but you know what they say about truth and fiction.

TL;DR: I'm 25, and I've developed feelings for my best friend's 21-year-old sister. I'm torn between confessing my feelings and keeping quiet. I'm seeking advice on how to approach this situation without ruining the friendship.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 25 and she's 21. That's a huge age gap. You need to consider the power dynamic and the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with someone that young. It's not worth risking your friendship with your best friend over."
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to think about how this could affect your friend's relationship with her sister. Even if Olivia feels the same way, it could still be a complicated situation."
* "I'm not saying it's a good idea, but have you considered talking to Olivia about how you feel? Maybe she feels the same way and you can explore a relationship together. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way, and you need to be okay with that."
* "I think you should just be honest with your friend about how you feel. If she's cool with it, then you can explore a relationship with Olivia. If not, then you can just maintain your friendship with both of them. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep secrets and risk damaging your relationships."
* "I'm a woman, and I've been in a similar situation before. I can tell you that it's not uncommon for people to develop feelings for their friends' siblings. Just be respectful of the situation and consider the feelings of everyone involved. If Olivia doesn't feel the same way, then you need to be okay with that and move on."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling this way. Is it because you genuinely have feelings for Olivia, or is it because you're bored with your current life and are looking for something new? Make sure you're not using Olivia as a way to escape your own problems."



This post is a great example of a complex and sensitive situation that requires careful consideration and empathy. The OP is torn between confessing his feelings to his best friend's sister and keeping quiet, and is seeking advice on how to approach the situation without ruining the friendship. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from cautioning against pursuing a relationship with someone so much younger, to encouraging the OP to be honest and open with his feelings. Some comments also raise important questions about power dynamics and the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with someone who is significantly younger. Overall, this post highlights the importance of considering the feelings and well-being of all parties involved in a situation like this.

TITLE: My cousin [f31] is getting married in June and asked me [f21] to be her maid of honour. I have no free time and don't know what to do

POST: So my cousin is getting married and while I'm really happy for her I don't think I'm responsible enough to take on the MOH role. I'm in school and also have a job. I've never even been to a wedding! Her friends organized a surprise engagement party for her and I feel horrible for not partaking. I just feel an immense amount of pressure and to be honest I don't necessarily want the responsibility. 

My cousin knows this, yet still gives me hints that I should start organizing something. I don't even know where to begin. I have too much on my plate right now really need to get my shit together. I know she will get really upset if I tell her I can't do it. 

What do I do Reddit?

TL;DR: My cousin asked me to be her maid of honour, but I'm overwhelmed with school and work and don't know what to do. I don't want to let her down, but I don't think I can handle the responsibility. Help!

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's okay to say no. You can't pour from an empty cup, and it sounds like you're already overwhelmed. Have a conversation with your cousin and explain your situation. You can offer to help in other ways, like being a bridesmaid or helping with smaller tasks. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being."
2. **MaidOfHonor2023**: "I was in your shoes once! I had to decline being MOH due to work and school commitments. I told my friend that I loved her and wanted to be there for her, but I just couldn't take on the responsibilities. We ended up having a great conversation, and she understood. You can do the same! Be honest with your cousin and offer alternative ways to help."
3. **CousinLove**: "I'm your cousin's friend, and I've seen her get really upset when people say no to her. Please don't feel pressured to take on the MOH role if you can't handle it. You can still be a great support system for her without being the MOH. Maybe offer to help with smaller tasks or be a part of the wedding party in a different way. Remember, your cousin loves you and wants you to be happy and healthy."
4. **WeddingPro**: "As someone who's been in the wedding industry for years, I can tell you that it's okay to say no to being MOH. It's a big responsibility, and you shouldn't feel obligated to take it on. You can offer to help with other aspects of the wedding, like planning the bachelorette party or helping with decorations. Just be honest with your cousin and explain your situation. She'll appreciate your honesty and understanding."
5. **Anonymous**: "I'm a bit of a cynic, but I think your cousin is trying to guilt trip you into being MOH. If you're not comfortable with the role, don't do it. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you deserve to prioritize your own well-being. Have a conversation with your cousin and set boundaries. Remember, it's okay to say no and mean it."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling with the pressure of being the maid of honour for their cousin's wedding, feeling overwhelmed with school and work commitments. The comments offer a range of advice, from being honest with the cousin and explaining the situation to offering alternative ways to help. The overall consensus is that it's okay to say no to the MOH role if it's too much to handle, and that prioritizing one's own well-being is important. The OP can take these comments into consideration and have a conversation with their cousin to find a solution that works for everyone.

TITLE: Insecure about every opinion I have about art and entertainment

POST: I'm extremely worried about my opinions on anything related to music, movies, books, shows, or otherwise related to matters of taste and culture.  I'm worried that I'll say the wrong thing and that what I like or dislike will somehow reflect negatively on my intelligence or worth.  There's a sizeable chunk of the internet that seems to hold an unwritten notion that the minority of smart people like one set of things and the "idiot masses" like another set of things and never the twain shall meet.  I don't know if I'm smart or if I'm part of the ostensibly vast masses of idiots that are, according to various rants I've read, apparently responsible for the death of culture and the plummeting quality of everything.

To make things more difficult, I don't know which opinion I read on something is the "smart" opinion.  So I don't even know what I should even be looking for.  All I know is I've seen a couple of movies recently and I've been scared to death to say anything about them lest I confirm my nagging doubts about my intelligence and perception (or, rather, lack thereof).

TL;DR: I'm worried about my opinions on art and entertainment because I'm afraid of being seen as stupid or uncultured.  I don't know what the "smart" opinion is, so I'm hesitant to share my own.

Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from. It's like, you're worried about being judged for having an opinion that's different from what you think others might think is "cool" or "smart". But here's the thing: there's no one "smart" opinion. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, and that's what makes the world interesting!

I think it's awesome that you're willing to share your thoughts and opinions, even if they might not align with what others think. And honestly, who cares what others think? It's your opinion, and it's valid just because it's yours.

So, go ahead and share your thoughts on those movies! You might be surprised at how many people share your opinions, or how many people have different opinions that are just as valid. And who knows, you might even discover some new favorite movies or artists!

Remember, it's okay to be different, and it's okay to have your own opinions. You don't have to conform to what others think is "cool" or "smart". Just be yourself, and share your thoughts with the world!

TITLE: I [24 M] am very certain my gf [20] is going to break up with me tomorrow. What would you do?

POST: We've been together almost two years now and it's only recently been getting really rocky. 

I screwed up a an outing (concert) by getting too drunk and not really knowing the what was going on. 

It wasn't the first time I got too wasted, but never liked to drink before, she kinda reintroduced me into it. I accept responsibility though. 

She said she didn't know how to feel about us anymore and wanted time off. 

I've been devastated ever since. I left town to visit relatives the day after and am returning home tonight. 

In that town, our mutual friend is there who happens to be my gfs best friend. I contacted her to ask for advice. 

Gf told me she found that unattractive and immature of me, I told her I was just in search of a way to fix the problem because I love her so dearly. 

She asked if I was back in town, I said no. She asked me to tell her when I get back because we'll have to talk... 

What do I do?

TL;DR: I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me tomorrow. I got too drunk at a concert and it's been rocky ever since. I'm returning home tonight and she wants to talk when I get back. Should I just go with it and accept the breakup or try to fix things?

COMMENT 1:
Dude, it sounds like you're already accepting responsibility for your actions and trying to make amends. That's a great start. When you talk to her tomorrow, be honest and open about your feelings and what you've learned from the experience. It's possible that she's just feeling overwhelmed and needs some space. Try to have a calm and respectful conversation and see where it takes you.

COMMENT 2:
I would say that you should try to fix things, but not by trying to manipulate or guilt trip her into staying. Instead, focus on having an honest and open conversation about your feelings and what you've learned from the experience. It's possible that she's feeling uncertain about the future of your relationship and needs some time to think. By being open and honest, you can help her feel more comfortable and secure in your relationship.

COMMENT 3:
I think you should just accept the breakup and move on. It sounds like your girlfriend has been feeling uncertain about the relationship for a while now, and your actions at the concert may have been the final straw. Instead of trying to fix things, you could focus on moving forward and finding someone who is a better match for you. Remember that it's okay to end a relationship that's no longer working for you, and it's not always necessary to try to fix things.

COMMENT 4:
I would say that you should try to fix things, but only if you're both on the same page. If your girlfriend is still unsure about the relationship and you're not willing to work on it together, then it may be best to accept the breakup. However, if you both want to work on the relationship and you're willing to put in the effort, then it's worth trying to fix things. Remember that relationships take work and communication, and it's not always easy to fix things. But if you're both committed to making it work, then it's worth trying.

COMMENT 5:
I think you should try to fix things, but you need to be honest with yourself about your own feelings and motivations. Are you really willing to work on the relationship and make changes to improve it, or are you just trying to avoid the breakup? If you're not willing to put in the effort, then it may be best to accept the breakup and move on. But if you're genuinely committed to making the relationship work, then it's worth trying to fix things. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and you need to be willing to listen to your partner and work together to make it work.

TITLE: Carpooling is financially beneficial, but I can't deal with my coworker all day long every day

POST: My coworker and I have to drive to a city over an hour away every day for work. So financially it makes sense for us to take turns driving. The problem is, I can't stand this guy all day long. I come home from work every day exhausted--not from the work but from being around my coworker for the whole day.

He talks too much, either about meaningless bullshit or really, really weird things for which there are no good responses. He complains all the time about who's not doing enough work or how others are doing their jobs, etc, no matter how many times I tell him to quit worrying about everyone else and just do his own work. And this is all made worse by the fact that we have to get up really early to be at work on time and I do not do well with that.

Frankly, it'd be worth the financial hit to not have to spend every day with this guy.

Anyone have any advice on how I can nicely break the carpooling setup or something? He likes me a lot and he's the one who got me this job, so I don't want to be mean and tell him the honest reason why I don't want to drive with him every day.

TL;DR: I have to carpool with my coworker every day for work, but I can't stand him. He talks too much, complains, and is exhausting to be around. I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I need a break from him. How can I nicely break the carpooling setup?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Have you tried setting boundaries? Like, 'Hey, I'm happy to carpool with you, but can we take turns driving every other day instead of every day?' That way, you still get the benefits of carpooling, but you also get a break from each other. You could also suggest doing something else during the drive, like listening to music or podcasts, to make the time go by faster."
2. **u/username1234**: "I'd suggest having a calm and honest conversation with your coworker. You could say something like, 'Hey, I really appreciate you getting me this job and I value our working relationship, but I have to be honest with you, I'm really struggling with our daily drives together. I feel like we're not compatible in terms of our personalities and it's affecting my mental health. Would it be possible for us to find another solution, like taking turns driving or finding someone else to carpool with?' Be clear and respectful, and I'm sure he'll understand."
3. **u/anonymous12345**: "I'd recommend finding a third person to carpool with. That way, you can still get the benefits of carpooling, but you'll have a break from your coworker. You could also try to find someone who shares your interests or has a similar personality to yours, which might make the drives more enjoyable."
4. **u/user1234567**: "Have you considered talking to your coworker about your concerns and seeing if you can find a compromise? Maybe there's something specific that's bothering you about his behavior that you can address directly. It's possible that he's not even aware of how his actions are affecting you and might be willing to make some changes to improve the situation."
5. **u/throwaway7890**: "I'd suggest trying to find the humor in the situation. Maybe make a joke about how you're'surviving' the drives or something. It might help lighten the mood and make the time go by faster. You could also try to find some common ground with your coworker, like a shared interest or hobby, to talk about during the drives. Who knows, you might even discover that you have more in common than you thought!"

TITLE: Can I refuse to sign an amendment to my Employer contract which was not pre-agreed? (Location: UK - Wales)

POST: What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?

Background:
My employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.

My problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. 

I calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as £530. I only earn £1,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.

Can I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?

My issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).

I think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary. New job would be a  £4,500 pay increase; walking distance so less fuel costs; less travel time etc.

TL;DR: Employer is trying to make me repay costs of exams and training if I leave within 36 months. I didn't agree to this beforehand and it's being imposed on me now. Can I refuse to sign the document without it affecting my employment?

---

**Legal Advice:**

The poster is correct that they did not agree to the amendment and it is being imposed on them without prior agreement. In the UK, an employer cannot unilaterally change the terms of an employment contract without the employee's consent.

The poster's employer is attempting to impose a new term on them, which is a variation of the contract. The poster has the right to refuse to sign the document and negotiate the terms of the amendment.

The poster should consider the following options:

1. Refuse to sign the document and negotiate the terms of the amendment with their employer.
2. Request a meeting with their employer to discuss the amendment and the impact it will have on their employment.
3. Seek legal advice from a qualified employment lawyer to understand their rights and options.

It is important to note that the poster's employment is not automatically terminated if they refuse to sign the document. However, their employer may take disciplinary action or terminate their employment if they fail to comply with the new terms.

In terms of the interview, the poster should be honest with the employer about the situation and explain that they are seeking clarification on the amendment and their rights as an employee. The employer may be willing to work with the poster to find a solution that meets both parties' needs.

**Additional Tips:**

* The poster should keep a record of all correspondence and meetings with their employer regarding the amendment.
* The poster should also keep a record of any agreements or understandings reached with their employer.
* The poster should consider seeking legal advice from a qualified employment lawyer to understand their rights and options.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my ex [19F] of 2 years, when we decided to break up for the semester, we said we'd talk during the winter break, but...

POST: My ex girlfriend and I dated for 2 years and broke up at the beginning of September, we ended in good terms and stayed in touch throughout the semester. When we broke up though she said she didn't want us to stop talking, and we'd talk about us in the Winter break... 

Here comes the winter break, and 2 weeks later we've hung out twice. Once with all of our friends, and once just the two of us (we didn't talk about us just had lunch and caught up. It went well and i even noticed she's still wearing a ring i gave her on our 2 year anniversary). 

Now though, I asked her if we could talk yesterday and she didn't respond at all and it's almost like she's avoiding talking about it. Today, she wasn't in a good mood when i texted her to see if we can meet and talk about us. Caught off guard, i told her if she didn't want to talk about it right now, i'd back off. She responded with "That would be nice." 

I'm just confused with what's going on. It seemed like we were going to get back together, as she was still wearing the ring, and well I may just be blinded because i want her back. But now I'm just unsure, confused and a little hurt. I'm going to back off as i said i would, and contact her again in weeks to come.

TL;DR: Ex girlfriend and I broke up in September, we said we'd talk during winter break, hung out twice, but now she's avoiding talking about us and I'm confused and hurt.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's not ready to talk about it yet, and maybe not even ready to get back together. Give her space and don't pressure her. You said you'd back off, so do that and let her come to you when she's ready to talk." (123 upvotes)
* "I think you're reading too much into the ring. Just because she's still wearing it doesn't mean she wants to get back together. Maybe it's just a sentimental thing for her. Don't put too much pressure on it." (56 upvotes)
* "You need to have a real conversation with her about what's going on. Don't just assume she's avoiding talking about it because she's not ready to get back together. Maybe there's something going on in her life that's making it hard for her to talk about it. Try to have a genuine conversation and see where it takes you." (34 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit too clingy. You said you'd back off, so do that. Give her space and let her come to you when she's ready to talk. Don't keep texting her and expecting her to respond. You need to respect her boundaries." (21 upvotes)

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is confused and hurt because his ex is avoiding talking about their relationship.
* Some commenters suggest giving her space and not pressuring her to talk about it.
* Others suggest having a real conversation with her to understand what's going on.
* Some commenters think the OP is reading too much into the ring and should focus on having a genuine conversation with his ex. (Source: Reddit) 1. What is the main issue in this post?

TITLE: I [20 M] can't help being jealous of my best friend [20 M] and it's hurting our relationship

POST: My best friend from high school, let's call him Harry, is really successful. Like, ridiculously so. Self-made multi-millionaire at 20 after starting his own business at 18 while also graduating from university 2 years early. We were rivals in a bunch of things at school, and it wasn't a problem, but had a big fight when I was rejected from my first-choice university after Harry also applied and got in with a very similar resume, even though he had no intention of going. We made up, and later he offered me a chance to join him in starting his business (part-time while studying), but I declined.

In hindsight, I think that not putting enough effort into university applications and not being willing to commit to the work associated with a start-up are two of the worst decisions I've made. I'm fairly high-achieving by most standards: have ended up at a top university anyway, getting good grades, currently working a well-paid internship, etc. Of course it's difficult not to be comparative, but by itself the fact that I'm jealous of Harry is something I think I can deal with. What's making it really problematic that his successes are closely correlated with my own biggest regrets. Since we're living in different countries right now, it takes some effort to Skype and stay in contact; but because of those associations and the emotional response I get when thinking about them, I'm increasingly hesitant to do so (he talks about his academic and corporate work a fair bit, since they're very big parts of his life right now), and have to focus on pushing down those feelings when we're talking. Of course this is my problem not his, and I'm not sure it's the sort of thing I'd want to discuss with him, but I'm wondering how people would recommend dealing with this.

TL;DR: I'm jealous of my best friend's success, which is closely tied to my own biggest regrets. It's making it hard for me to stay in touch with him and I'm not sure how to deal with these feelings.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can help individuals work through their emotions and gain perspective on their relationships. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of jealousy and regret, which are closely tied to his best friend's success. He's aware that these feelings are irrational and that he should be happy for his friend, but he's finding it difficult to shake them off.

The OP is seeking advice on how to deal with these feelings and how to maintain a healthy relationship with his best friend. He's aware that he shouldn't burden his friend with these emotions, but he's not sure how to manage them on his own.

The comments on this post are filled with advice and support from fellow Redditors. Some people suggest that the OP should focus on his own goals and achievements, rather than comparing himself to his friend. Others recommend that he try to reframe his thinking and focus on the positive aspects of his friend's success.

One commenter suggests that the OP should try to have an open and honest conversation with his friend about his feelings, but also acknowledges that this may not be the best approach. Another commenter recommends that the OP try to find ways to celebrate his own successes and achievements, rather than focusing on his friend's.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a safe and supportive space for individuals to work through their emotions and gain perspective on their relationships. The comments offer a range of advice and support, and the OP is able to gain a better understanding of his feelings and how to manage them.

TITLE: Protecting my brand - question

POST: I'm starting a business (only local and online at first, no brick and mortar) and at first this will only be selling apparel. 

I have a name of the business, a name of the apparel line, and a logo. I've check trademarks and everything is fine - do I need to trademark the name before I sell anything? 

The trademark (I believe has to be done separate since the names are slightly different between company name and apparel line name) is expensive I think (700 up front maybe?) - didn't know without doing that if I had any protection if someone stole my name and or logo.

TL;DR: Do I need to trademark my business name and apparel line name before selling anything? Is there any protection if I don't? 

---

**Legal Advice:**

You're wise to consider trademark protection for your business and apparel line names. While it's not strictly necessary to trademark your names before selling anything, it's highly recommended to do so to ensure you have legal protection against others using similar names.

In the United States, the Trademark Act of 1946 provides that a trademark is not valid until it's registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). However, you can still use the symbol () to indicate that you're claiming common law trademark rights in your name, even if you haven't registered it.

Common law trademark rights arise from the use of a mark in commerce, and they can provide some protection against others using similar marks. However, common law rights are limited to the geographic area where you're doing business, and they may not provide the same level of protection as a registered trademark.

Registering your trademarks with the USPTO can provide several benefits, including:

1. Nationwide protection: A registered trademark provides protection across the entire United States, rather than just the geographic area where you're doing business.
2. Legal presumptions: A registered trademark creates a legal presumption that you're the owner of the mark, which can make it easier to prove your rights in court.
3. Notice to others: A registered trademark puts others on notice that you're claiming rights in the mark, which can help prevent them from using similar marks.
4. Ability to sue for infringement: A registered trademark gives you the ability to sue for trademark infringement in federal court.

As for the cost, you're correct that the initial filing fee for a trademark application can be around $700. However, this fee is non-refundable, even if your application is rejected. Additionally, you may need to respond to office actions and other issues that arise during the application process, which can add to the overall cost.

In your case, since you have a business name and an apparel line name, you may want to consider filing separate applications for each name. This can help ensure that you have protection for each name separately, and it can also help you to establish distinctiveness for each name.

Ultimately, whether or not to trademark your business and apparel line names is a decision that depends on your specific circumstances and goals. If you're unsure about what to do, you may want to consider consulting with a trademark attorney who can provide you with personalized advice and guidance.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my Ex-Fiancee[27 F] 5 years, how long until it doesn't matter?

POST: Fairly new Redditor here, and a private person so posting something like this should show the level of lost I'm at...also sorry if format is wonky. 

Anyway, had a relationship with an awesome girl starting Jr year of college and extending through 3 years after graduation. A little bickering but no big fights and we got along really well 95% of the time. We had moved in together, both had stable jobs and were engaged to be married in 7 months time. (Had been engaged about a year at this point.)

One night she wakes me up 1-2 AM and simply says "I'm done." No clue or hints leading up to it, just two words, goes downstairs to sleep on the couch, and has packed essentials for a move to parents house while I am at work the next day. In 6 months she's married a new guy but claims all that happened "after us." Come to find out her parents resented me for... reasons (honestly never clear on the what or why) and basically had been telling her to do better for a few years. YEARS! 

So...it's two years later and I'm with a wonderful girl for almost a year now. Problem is I go into these funks where all I can think about is what I lost, what could I do different, etc. This sounds bad but probably 2-3 times a month I wake up and my first waking thought is crippling disappointment that she's not there next to me. I am 100% committed with my current girl, but deep deep down I don't know how I would feel if relationship prospects with the ex weren't 100% killed. How long (or how do I) get back to "normal"? Any advice on ways to stop dreaming/imagining about the life we were planning?

Thank you fellow Redditors.

TL;DR: Ex-fiancee left me 2 years ago, got married to someone else, and I'm still having trouble moving on. I'm with someone new now, but still have moments where I think about what could've been. How long until it doesn't matter?

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for people to share their experiences and receive advice. The OP (original poster) is struggling to come to terms with the end of his engagement and the loss of the life they had planned together. He's still having trouble moving on and is wondering how long it will take for him to stop thinking about what could've been.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the situation. The OP is also open and honest about his feelings, which makes it easier for others to relate to and offer advice.

Some of the comments on this post are also very helpful and supportive. For example, one commenter suggests that the OP focus on the present and the future with his new partner, rather than dwelling on the past. Another commenter recommends that the OP try to reframe his thinking and focus on the positive aspects of his current relationship.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for people to share their experiences and receive advice. It's a reminder that everyone goes through difficult times, and that it's okay to take time to process and heal. With the right support and advice, it's possible to move on and find happiness again.

TITLE: Have lost all my motivation to go to work

POST: I recently switched jobs (5 months) from a larger institution to a smaller company. Over the last month I have gotten very disillusioned with my new job, I miss the camaraderie of my old job as well as the lower level of stress. Also the old job was much closer to my house.

For me the most important thing is not my job, I don't have the ambition to be in a super high paying job, I like having an average job if it means I have the energy and motivation to do that and extracurriculars.

I recently applied to a different job posting at my old company. I feel totally unmotivated to go to work and I've called in "sick" about 3-4 times the last month....

I guess what I'm asking is; how do I stay motivated to keep going to work right now, at least until I get another job, and should I just go back to my old boss and ask him for my old job back (as opposed to trying for this new position). He mentioned I could do that because he likes me.

TL;DR: Lost motivation at new job, miss old job, applied to old job, feeling unmotivated to go to work. How to stay motivated and should I go back to old job?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I'd say take a step back and identify what's causing your lack of motivation. Is it the work itself, the environment, the people, or something else? Once you pinpoint the issue, you can start working on a solution. In the meantime, try to find small things to look forward to each day, like a favorite coffee or a short walk during lunch. And don't be too hard on yourself if you need to take a day off every now and then."
2. **u/throwaway321**: "I think you should take a break and recharge. It's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. If you're feeling burnt out, it's not going to help you in the long run. Take some time to focus on yourself and what you want. You can always go back to your old job or explore other options. Remember, it's okay to take a break and prioritize your own well-being."
3. **u/throwaway456**: "I'd say don't be afraid to have an open and honest conversation with your current boss about how you're feeling. They may be able to offer some support or resources to help you get back on track. And if not, it's okay to start looking for a new job that aligns better with your values and priorities. Remember, your well-being is important, and it's okay to prioritize it."
4. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you should try to find ways to make your current job more enjoyable. Are there any tasks or projects that you're passionate about? Are there any colleagues you enjoy working with? Focus on those things and try to find ways to make your job more fulfilling. And if that's not possible, it may be time to start looking for a new job that aligns better with your values and priorities."
5. **u/throwaway012**: "I'd say don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel unmotivated sometimes, especially when you're going through a big change. Take some time to focus on yourself and what you want. You can always go back to your old job or explore other options. Remember, it's okay to take a break and prioritize your own well-being."

TITLE: I [20 M] went on a date but was it really a date?

POST: So first a little bit of backstory to put things into context: I recently started university and got along well with a girl. I subsequently asked her out for dinner to which she accepted. It wasn't explicitly mentioned that it was a date but I guess I assumed it was implied which probably was a bad idea. The "date" went extremely well and I did have a wonderful time with her and although I really do like her, I get the impression it's one sided.

During the date, I told her that I considered this a date and whatnot and well I feel like I've put my foot in my mouth. How do I now tell her that I don't really care what happens and I would rather keep her as a friend than be awkward around each other?

TL;DR: Went on a date with a girl, told her it was a date, now I'm worried it wasn't and I don't know how to tell her I don't want anything romantic.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you gotta own up to your mistake and be honest with her. Tell her how you're feeling and that you value your friendship with her. It's better to be upfront and clear than to lead her on or pretend like nothing's wrong. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "I think you're overthinking this. If you had a good time and you're interested in getting to know her better, why not just be honest and tell her how you feel? It's not like you're asking her to marry you or anything. Just be genuine and see where it goes."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I don't think you should be worried about what she thinks. You're the one who's been honest about your intentions, and if she's not interested, then that's okay. You can't control how others feel, but you can control how you react to it. Just be respectful and move on if it's not meant to be."
4. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I feel your pain, dude. I once did something similar and it was super awkward. But honestly, just be honest and apologize for any confusion. You can say something like, 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our dinner the other night. I think I might have gotten a little ahead of myself and assumed it was a date, but I really value our friendship and I don't want things to get weird between us.'"
5. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "Hey there! It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about how to approach this situation. Remember that honesty is usually the best policy, especially when it comes to relationships. Try to be clear and direct with your intentions, and see how she reacts. If she's not interested, don't take it personally and move on. And if she is interested, then you can start exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship. Good luck!"

TITLE: [HELP] My girlfriend's dog isn't trained, and she refuses to let me train him...

POST: Her dog has been with her since it was 8 weeks old. He is always at her side and she spoils him.

He also has the bad habit of begging for food when we are eating because she gives him food from her plate. She believes dogs in nature just expect humans to share food with them and she is completely okay with letting him lick the plates and bowls clean "if he didn't beg". Which just means if he lays by her feet and stares at her, she will eventually give him food. How can I break this behavior?

He also doesn't use his dog bed to sleep in, instead he humps it. And she allows him to hump it. He humps sheets, pillows, anything and she doesn't scold him at all. I'm afraid to get a cat because he might start humping it.

Upon the front door opening he makes a break for it. He doesn't wait, doesn't hesitate. And just runs for it, which makes me afraid I might come home from work and he will run out and I'd have to chase him down.

He also barks randomly at random times even after being let out or played with. It's quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and he is barking up a storm and scratching the bed I'm sleeping on.

He sleeps on top of the couch and I try to make sure he stays off the furniture but according to her " thats just what he does"

If he is on my bed or the couch he will also start trying to dig and I dont like him doing that to my sheets because he's a dog with nails and I don't want my sheets or couch ripped.

Every time I try to bring these issues up to her she tells me it's her dog, not to yell at him, don't push him down when he's jumping on things, etc.

How do I fix this situation? Or am I overreacting?

TL;DR: My girlfriend's dog has some bad habits and she refuses to let me train him. I'm worried about his behavior and the impact it's having on our relationship.

**Comments:**

* "I'm not a professional, but it seems like your girlfriend is enabling some pretty bad behaviors. You might want to have a calm, non-accusatory conversation with her about how these behaviors are affecting you and your relationship. Maybe she's not aware of the impact her actions are having on the dog's behavior."
* "I'm a dog trainer and I would say that it's not uncommon for dogs to develop bad habits when their owners don't set clear boundaries. It's not that the dog is 'bad', it's just that they're not being taught what's expected of them. You might want to try setting some clear rules and boundaries with your girlfriend and see if you can work together to train the dog."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. The dog is just being a dog. If you're really that bothered by his behavior, maybe you should consider getting a dog of your own. That way you can train it the way you want and it won't be a source of conflict in your relationship."
* "I'm a dog owner and I can attest that it's not uncommon for dogs to develop bad habits when their owners don't set clear boundaries.

TITLE: I just found out my best friend self-harms. What do I do?

POST: A bit of background on her: seventeen, in high school (as well as myself). Straight-A student, probably going Ivy League. Quiet around most people, loud and hyperactive around me. Likes to read. Popular, but I've noticed she seems to crave attention a lot -- she's a self-described 'camwhore' with a 'god complex', and I've seen her do various 4chan tinychats with thirty or forty guys, even though she was [doxed] once. I don't ever say anything about it, as it's her business. She was also homeschooled as a kid -- didn't go to public school until age fourteen.

She has panic attacks and cuts typically when her parents tell her she's doing something wrong, whether it's minor or not. She says she 'doesn't like to think [she] does things wrong, just different' and she 'wants them to know she cares.' I know she cuts because she sent me a picture. I deleted it, even though I know now I really shouldn't have.

I also know I have to tell someone, but I don't know who. Her parents wouldn't believe me, and she's convinced that cutting is the only way to release pain, so she won't get herself help. Can I help her? If so, whom should I go to? I'm not sure the school counselors are of any use -- I've been through this a few times with different people and different issues, and they're very negligent in these sorts of matters.

TL;DR: Best friend self-harms, I found out, and I don't know what to do. She's homeschooled, and her parents won't believe me. School counselors are probably useless. Help?

TITLE: The (shortened, not-so-detailed) story of me [16M] and my ex [15F]

POST: Four things before I start: 1. I'll be using faux names, me as Jack, her as Kit. 2. It was short, but wonderfully amazing. 3. I am a junior, her a freshman. 4. She is bisexual
So, me and Kit met at band camp, and quickly became friends, mostly because we both play clarinet. Apparently, she really liked me from the start. I liked her as well. Jump ahead about a month, and you find me and Kit at an after-game party. She soon asks "Hey Jack? Would you like to be my boyfriend?". And I reply "who wouldn't, Kit?". Soon, we are cuddling on a nearby bench.

Jump ahead about 2 weeks, and you'll find Kit slowly unzipping my pants(we are both needy on the sexual side). Soon enough, I get a good sucking. And a little later, she gets a good show of my finger tricks. Again, jump ahead a week or so, and you join us in an adventure:
"Hey, Jack?"
"Yeah?"
"Where's the quietest place we can go?"
"Follow me, my lovely Kit"
I lead her to the guest bedroom. She hops on the bed, and tells me to undo my pants. I do so, and then she follows. As I lean her back, I mention how sexy she is. It gets sweaty in that room for a few moments.

Skip ahead, again, 2 weeks, and you'll find me sucking her breasts. Again(for the laat time), skip ahead a few weeks, and you'll find us hardly talking to each other.

I'm gonna need help to get over this, guys.
We are friends, as in we still contact each other, and, plot twist, she would like to go to prom with me

TL;DR: I had a short, but amazing relationship with my ex, Kit. We had some great times, but eventually stopped talking. She wants to go to prom with me, and I'm struggling to get over her.

**Reddit's Response:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're 16 and you're sharing this much detail about your relationship with a 15-year-old girl. That's not okay. You need to focus on your own healing and growth, not on rekindling something with someone who's still a minor."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "Hey there! I'm here to help. It sounds like you're still reeling from the breakup. Remember that it's okay to take time to process your emotions. Have you considered talking to a trusted adult or a therapist about your feelings? They can help you work through this."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I'm not sure I buy the whole 'we're just friends now' thing. If she's still got feelings for you, it's probably not healthy for you to be in contact with her right now. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being."
4. **u/teen_tales**: "I'm 17 and I went through something similar with my ex. It's tough, but you need to focus on yourself and your own growth. Don't get caught up in the idea of going to prom with someone just to relive the past. You deserve better than that."
5. **u/anonymous_user**: "I'm not sure what's more concerning, the fact that you're sharing this much detail about your relationship with a minor or the fact that you're still in contact with her. You need to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities."

**Reddit's Response Analysis:**

The responses on this subreddit are a mix of concern, advice, and skepticism.

TITLE: Found out my (28F) best friend (29F) of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post. At a loss for words.

POST: First, the goods news. She is no longer living with cancer!

This morning when I woke up and for some reason grabbed my phone and checked Facebook immediately. I rarely do this. This first post I see is from my best friend announcing that today is a good day because she is cancer free. I was in shock because I didn't even know she had cancer!

Clearly she has her reasons for not sharing this information with me, but I feel like an absolutely terrible friend that she felt she could not tell me. Furthermore, I have known a lot of people to get cancer in the past 7 years, and I always would tell her "so and so has cancer and I'm really sad, hoping she/he will get better soon" and if I'd known she also had cancer I wouldn't have brought it up so much!

A bit of background on our friendship and why I feel I've been an insufficient friend to her:
We met in elementary school and were bffs. During my second year of high school, I had to move so we stopped seeing each other as much. We still hung out when we could and she was always my best friend. At the end of high school I started dating a guy who turned out to be abusive. We were together for 5 years, and throughout that time period he slowly isolated me from my friends and family, and said mean things about the people closest to me. (Things like my parents didn't really love me and other fucked up things.)

Anyway, I got out of that relationship, so i started hanging out with her more again. It was a relief to me that she didn't completely hate me for my time spent being distant. For the past five years we've lived in different cities, but we still see each other once in a while and write letters to each other. (We've always sent each other snail mail)

I'm currently working on a reply to one of her letters, but I don't know how to approach this topic, since I found out through social media and not a personal message. I already feel terrible that I haven't even sent her a text.

TL;DR: I found out my best friend of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post, and I'm feeling terrible about it.

---

This post is a great example of how social media can sometimes be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows people to connect with each other and share information quickly and easily. On the other hand, it can also be a source of pain and hurt when people find out important information through a public post rather than a personal message.

The OP (original poster) is feeling terrible about not being told about her friend's cancer diagnosis and is struggling to know how to approach the situation. She is worried about how her friend will react to her finding out through social media and is unsure of how to apologize and make things right.

The post has received a lot of comments and responses from other Redditors, many of whom are offering words of encouragement and support. Some people are suggesting that the OP reach out to her friend and apologize for not being told about the diagnosis, while others are advising her to take some time to process her emotions before reaching out.

Overall, this post is a great example of how social media can affect our relationships and how important it is to communicate openly and honestly with each other. It also highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in our interactions with others.

TITLE: Managers and/or military personnel; please help. What do you do when someone you're in charge of just won't listen to you or do his work?

POST: I'm in a leadership position in ROTC and we are in charge of drilling and marching cadets. I have a slacker who just won't pay attention or listen to rules. He is always half-assing everything, and in turn other cadets follow his influence. My colonel is chewing my ass because I'm responsible for him. 

Nothing I do phases him; he's the kind that was forced by parents into ROTC, and he's the kind of person who never follows rules and does drugs and has attitude problems. 

I try being nice to him, but that doesn't work. I gradually became stricter and stricter, even issuing push ups, and he flat out gave attitude to me and refused to do them.

Help?

TL;DR: I'm a ROTC leader struggling with a slacker cadet who won't listen or do his work. What do I do?

---

**Responses:**

1. **MilitaryVet**: "As a former military officer, I've dealt with my fair share of slackers. Here's what worked for me: 1) Set clear expectations and consequences. Make sure the cadet knows what's expected of him and what will happen if he doesn't meet those expectations. 2) Lead by example. Show the cadet that you're committed to your duties and expect the same from him. 3) Focus on positive reinforcement. Catch the cadet doing something right and praise him for it. 4) Don't take it personally. Remember, the cadet's behavior is a reflection of his own issues, not yours. Stay calm and professional, and don't let him get under your skin."
2. **Manager**: "I've had similar issues with employees who refuse to listen or do their work. Here's what I do: 1) Document everything. Keep a record of all conversations, meetings, and incidents. 2) Set clear goals and objectives. Make sure the cadet knows what's expected of him and what he needs to do to meet those expectations. 3) Provide feedback, not criticism. Focus on specific behaviors or actions that need improvement, rather than attacking the cadet personally. 4) Consider a performance improvement plan. If the cadet is consistently not meeting expectations, it may be time to put a plan in place to help him improve."
3. **FormerCadet**: "I was in ROTC for four years and had a similar experience with a cadet who refused to listen or do his work. Here's what worked for me: 1) Talk to the cadet one-on-one. Sometimes, people just need someone to listen to them and understand their perspective. 2) Find out what's driving the cadet's behavior. Is he struggling with something personal? Is he feeling overwhelmed? Once you understand the root cause, you can work together to find a solution. 3) Involve a higher authority. If the cadet is consistently not meeting expectations, it may be time to involve a higher authority, such as a drill sergeant or a commanding officer. 4) Lead by example. Show the cadet that you're committed to your duties and expect the same from him."
4. **Parent**: "As a parent, I've seen my kids struggle with similar issues in school. Here's what worked for us: 1) Set clear expectations and consequences. Make sure the cadet knows what's expected of him and what will happen if he doesn't meet those expectations. 2) Encourage positive reinforcement. Praise the cadet when he does something right, and encourage his peers to do the same. 3) Focus on building self-esteem. Sometimes, people act out because they're struggling with self-doubt or low self-esteem. Help the cadet build his confidence and self-worth. 4) Seek professional help. If the cadet's behavior is persistent and causing problems, it may be time to seek help from a professional counselor or therapist."

---

**Additional Tips:**

* Stay calm and professional when dealing with the cadet.
* Avoid taking the cadet's behavior personally.
* Focus on finding solutions rather than placing blame.
* Consider involving a higher authority if the cadet's behavior persists.
* Lead by example and show the cadet that you're committed to your duties.
* Provide feedback, not criticism, and focus on specific behaviors or actions that need improvement.
* Document everything and keep a record of all conversations, meetings, and incidents.
* Consider a performance improvement plan if the cadet is consistently not meeting expectations.

TITLE: Me[18M] I think I want to end a serious relationship, need advice. Her[16MF]

POST: I have been dating this girl on, and off, for over 5 years, some may say it's probably not serious, but it is. But my ex [18F] has recently re-kindled a strong passion I had for her for a while, about 6 months. I want to give it another shot, but I don't know how to cut the ties with the relationship I am in. I really love my current girlfriend, but I want to give my ex another shot, and I have no idea what to do. My current girlfriend is very attached to me, and I don't want to lose her, so I need real advice.

TL;DR: I've been in a serious relationship for 5 years, but I've reconnected with my ex and want to give it another shot. I love my current girlfriend, but I'm torn. Help me figure out what to do.

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway12345**: "Dude, you're 18 and you've been in a relationship for 5 years? That's crazy. You're still young, you should be exploring and having fun. Don't be afraid to take a chance on your ex, but also don't string your current girlfriend along. Be honest with her and see how she reacts. If she's willing to work through it, then maybe it's worth considering. But if she's not, then you need to prioritize your own happiness."
* **u/relationshipadvice**: "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but it sounds like you're being selfish. You're not thinking about your current girlfriend's feelings, you're just thinking about your own desires. You need to consider the impact your actions will have on her. If you do decide to pursue your ex, be prepared for the consequences. You might lose your current girlfriend, and you might also lose your ex's trust if she finds out you were still in a relationship with someone else."
* **u/itscomplicated**: "I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's not easy. You need to take some time to think about what you really want. Are you truly in love with your ex, or are you just feeling a strong attraction? Are you willing to risk losing your current girlfriend for a chance at something new? You need to be honest with yourself and your feelings. And if you do decide to pursue your ex, make sure you're prepared for the consequences."
* **u/justmy2cents**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're 18, you're young, and you have your whole life ahead of you. You don't need to rush into anything. Take some time to think about what you really want, and what's best for you. Don't be afraid to take a chance on your ex, but also don't be afraid to walk away if it's not meant to be. You deserve to be happy, and you deserve to be with someone who makes you feel that way."

TITLE: Me [23M] - cannot handle my friends [same age, M/F] hanging out with my parents

POST: Hi - kind of a weird question / situation. I'll try to be brief.

I am from country A, did high-school in country B, and am currently in the United States for college. My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.

The problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. 

I cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.

I remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.

So, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.

It's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.

TL;DR: I'm 23M, my friends are visiting my hometown and staying with my parents, and I'm having a hard time dealing with the fact that they're making memories without me.

**Comments:**

* "This is totally normal, dude. You're not alone. It's like, your friends are getting attention and bonding with your parents, and you're feeling left out. It's a weird feeling, but it's not uncommon. You're not a bad person for feeling this way."
* "I can relate. When I was in college, my friends would always hang out with my family without me, and it would make me feel super left out. I think it's because you're feeling like you're losing your connection with your friends, and that's scary. But honestly, it's not about you, it's about your friends and your parents having their own experiences. You can always make plans with your friends separately and catch up with them when they get back."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic, OP. Your friends are just staying with your parents for a few days, it's not like they're abandoning you or anything. You're making a big deal out of nothing. Just chill and enjoy the fact that your friends are having a good time with your parents. You can always hang out with them when they get back."
* "I think you should talk to your therapist about this, OP. It sounds like you're struggling with some deep-seated issues. Maybe there's something going on that you're not aware of, and your therapist can help you work through it. In the meantime, try to focus on the positive aspects of your friends staying with your parents. Maybe you can even join them for dinner or something and make some memories of your own."
* "I'm a bit surprised that your parents are taking your friends out without you. That seems a bit weird. Maybe you should have a chat with your parents about how you're feeling and see if they can make some adjustments. Maybe they can take you out with your friends or something. Just a thought."

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] of almost 3 years, suggested taking a break?

POST: A large group of our friends are going to this weekend camping festival and due to the size of it and how we are all arriving on different days it is unlikely that I am sharing a tent with my girlfriend.

She recently suggested that we "took a break" for the festival. At first I was shocked and didn't know if it was because she didn't want to spend time with me, had stopped liking me and even wanting to go out getting with other boys.

I obviously said no and asked why she wanted that and she just said she trusted me however didn't trust my friends and thinks they would egg me on to get with other girls and fool around a bit.

I'm really confused about the whole situation, she says she was "testing me" to see if I would want to take a break however that feels like she doesn't trust me. Also I feel like maybe she doesn't like me as much as I thought seeing as she suggested we break up so I can fool around..

I'm really confused about this whole situation and just want some outsiders' opinions to sort of guide me through it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of almost 3 years suggested taking a break for a weekend camping festival, saying she trusts me but doesn't trust my friends and thinks they would egg me on to get with other girls. I'm confused about her motives and if she still likes me.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's trying to test your commitment to the relationship. She's worried that you'll get tempted by other girls and wants to see how you react. It's not necessarily a reflection of her feelings for you, but rather her own insecurities."
* "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you feel. Ask her what she's really worried about and what she hopes to achieve by taking a break. It's possible that she's just feeling overwhelmed or stressed and needs some space."
* "It's not uncommon for couples to have different comfort levels when it comes to social situations. Maybe she's just not comfortable with the idea of you being around other girls, even if it's just friends. You could try having a conversation about what she's comfortable with and what you're willing to compromise on."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about what you want from this relationship. Are you willing to work through her insecurities and trust issues, or do you feel like it's a sign of bigger problems? You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected."
* "It's possible that she's just feeling a little burnt out or overwhelmed and needs some space. Maybe you could suggest doing something low-key together instead of going to the festival, or even just taking a break from each other for a little while. Communication is key in any relationship, so make sure you're talking openly and honestly with each other."

TITLE: [20M] I may have just lost a friend [20F].

POST: A little backstory from a post about a month ago 

So here is what's going on now. About a week ago, she took a break from her boyfriend. She came to my house and we fooled around for about 6 hours. It was amazing, but I feel like a horrible person for doing it. She says she loves me more than anything and wishes we were together, but she's too afraid to leave the position she's in now because it's "too risky". Now she's done with her break and she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I love her so much, I just don't know what to do anymore. I told her that it would be difficult being friends because at the end of the day, she'll be going home to her boyfriend and that's going to break my heart. Sorry guys, I feel like a total bitch looking for advice because I usually stray from this kind of drama that I somehow got sucked into. I just don't know what to do anymore. I guess I'm just hoping that thing don't work out for them, and that makes me feel incredibly selfish. Anyways, thanks for anything.

TL;DR: I had a one-night stand with a friend who's in a relationship, and now she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I'm torn between my feelings for her and the fact that I don't want to be friends with someone who's going to be with someone else.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Dude, you gotta take a step back and think about what you're doing here. You're not a rebound or a temporary fix for her problems. You deserve better than that. If she can't be honest with herself about her feelings and make a decision, then maybe she's not the right person for you. You can't keep going back and forth like this. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries. Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel and what you need from her.

2. **u/relationshipgoals**: I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's the truth. You need to cut ties with her. You can't keep being friends with someone who's going to be with someone else. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to her boyfriend. You deserve someone who's all in, not someone who's playing with your emotions. It's okay to be sad, but you need to prioritize your own happiness and move on.

3. **u/awkwardturtle**: I feel for you, dude. This is a tough spot to be in. But here's the thing: you can't control how she feels or what she decides to do. All you can control is how you react to the situation. If you're feeling guilty or torn, maybe it's because you're not being honest with yourself about your own feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just caught up in the excitement of the situation? Take some time to reflect on that, and then make a decision that's best for you.

4. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: Hey there! I'm a bot, and I'm here to offer some advice. It sounds like you're feeling torn between your feelings for this person and the fact that she's in a relationship. Here's the thing: you can't change the situation, but you can change how you react to it. If you're feeling guilty or torn, maybe it's because you're not being honest with yourself about your own feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just caught up in the excitement of the situation? Take some time to reflect on that, and then make a decision that's best for you. Remember, you deserve someone who's all in, not someone who's playing with your emotions. Good luck!

TITLE: [21 M] My friend won't hang out with me because she is on makeup break? [23 F]

POST: She is a cosmetologist. She wears a HEAVY amount of makeup. All the time. Recently she started breaking out in acne, that is what she told me. She told me she cried for an hour because of it and she has never had a break out this bad before. So she is on a "Makeup Break" I asked her how long and she said a week.

I asked to hang out and she said she couldn't because of makeup break. I told her I didn't care if she didn't wear makeup, she said that I would care. I don't know, our friendship is just platonic right now,

So now I feel kind of hurt and weird. Is this even normal? For a girl to not see her friends without wearing make up first? What am I supposed to say? I'm kind of upset actually, I feel played with.

TL;DR: Friend is a cosmetologist who wears heavy makeup all the time, recently started breaking out in acne, and is on a "makeup break" for a week. She won't hang out with me because of it. I feel hurt and weird.

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's a bit dramatic to call it a'makeup break' but I get why she might feel self-conscious about her skin. Maybe try asking her if there's anything else going on that's making her not want to hang out? It's possible there's more to it than just the acne."
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive about this. If she's going through a tough time with her skin, it's understandable that she wouldn't want to hang out. Maybe try being more supportive and understanding instead of getting upset."
* "I don't think it's normal for someone to not see their friends without wearing makeup first, but it's also not like she's saying she can't hang out with you ever again. Maybe just give her some space and time to focus on her skin and she'll come back to you when she's feeling better."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're not judging her based on her appearance and that you're there for her as a friend. Maybe she'll open up to you about what's really going on and you can work through this together."
* "I think it's a bit ridiculous that she's calling it a'makeup break' but I also get why she might feel self-conscious about her skin. Maybe try asking her if there's anything else going on that's making her not want to hang out? It's possible there's more to it than just the acne." (same comment as the first one)

This post and its comments highlight the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication. The OP is feeling hurt and weird because their friend is not willing to hang out with them without makeup, which they perceive as a rejection of their friendship. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from understanding and supportive to critical and dismissive. Some commenters suggest that the OP should try to be more understanding and supportive of their friend's struggles with acne, while others think that the OP is being too sensitive and should just give their friend some space.

The post also raises questions about the importance of appearance in relationships and how people present themselves to others. The friend's decision to take a "makeup break" suggests that she is prioritizing her appearance and may be using it as a way to avoid social interactions or to gain attention. The OP's reaction to this decision highlights the tension between the desire for authenticity and the pressure to present a certain image to others.

Ultimately, the post and its comments suggest that relationships are complex and multifaceted, and that communication and understanding are key to navigating the challenges that arise. The OP's friend may be going through a difficult time, and the OP's reaction to her decision may be influenced by their own insecurities and biases. By engaging in open and honest communication, the OP and their friend can work through their issues and strengthen their friendship.

TITLE: My boyfriend [23/m] is a picky eater and I'm [23/f] sick of it.

POST: My boyfriend is a horrendously picky eater, both when we cook at home (most of the week) and when we go out (once or twice a week). He'll eat only white chicken meat, steak, pizza, spaghetti or a hamburger. Green beans are the only veggie he'll touch, and he has to be vigorously persuaded to eat any fruits, after which he expects to be praised as if he's done something wonderful.

I'm an adventurous eater, and I work out hard during the day so that I can enjoy something I like for dinner. I love sushi, curries, gyro, pho, ramen, etc etc. Boyfriend won't even try any of these, for a plethora of excuses.

I'm fine if he contains his picky eating to himself, but I'm sick of always going to his restaurants because I can find something I'll tolerate on their menus, and he won't go near any of mine. I want to be able to cook more adventurously at home (usual menu is chicken breast, rice or potatoes, green beans- BORING) without him whining and just eating a muffin or frozen pizza instead. I'm worried about his health and I resent not being able to do something I enjoy.

In the past, we've had very nonconstructive conversations about this. He got defensive, I got snarky. I need a way to reframe the issue, maybe some scripting help or practical compromises. Any ideas?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is a picky eater, I'm sick of it. Want to cook more adventurously at home without him whining. Need help reframing the issue and finding practical compromises.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with him about how his pickiness affects you? Maybe he's not aware of how it's impacting your life and you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
2. **u/foodie4life**: "I'm a picky eater too, and I understand where your boyfriend is coming from. But it's great that you're willing to try new things! Maybe you can compromise and cook something he likes, and then make a side dish that you enjoy. That way, you both get something you like."
3. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're willing to work on this together. Have you considered couples' cooking classes? You can learn new recipes and cooking techniques together, and it might help you both find common ground."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with the idea of compromising on food. If you're an adventurous eater, why should you have to adjust your diet to accommodate his pickiness? Maybe it's time to have a serious conversation about whether this is something you can work through together."
5. **u/communicationiskey**: "I think the key is to focus on the reasons behind his pickiness, rather than just the pickiness itself. Is he a picky eater because of a traumatic experience, or because he's just not used to trying new things? Once you understand the root cause, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I think I was expecting a lot of 'just deal with it' or 'he's just being picky' responses, but instead I got some really helpful and constructive advice.

I think @u/throwaway123456 is right, I need to have a more open and honest conversation with my boyfriend about how his pickiness is affecting me. I'm going to try to approach it in a non-accusatory way and see if we can find some common ground.

@u/foodie4life, I like the idea of cooking something he likes and then making a side dish that I enjoy. That way, we can both get something we like and it's not all about compromise.

@u/relationshipgoals, couples' cooking classes are a great idea! I think that would be a fun and relaxed way to learn some new recipes and cooking techniques together.

@u/skeptical_sarah, I see what you mean. I guess I was hoping that we could find a way to work through this together, but maybe it's not meant to be. I'll have to think about whether this is something I'm willing to compromise on.

@u/communicationiskey, I think you're right, understanding the root cause of his pickiness is key. I'll try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding.

Thanks again, everyone, for your helpful comments!"

TITLE: G/F refuses to move away from the city ever

POST: My current g/f (she is 24) of 5 years and I (am 28 turn 29 in Jan) are living together. She works in the financial business at a call center and I work at a engineering company designing and building plants. I am a recent grad and got a job here in the town she grew up in and where we both went to college. We have been talking and I told her at some point I will prob wind up in the field or will move to a job site for awhile to gain experience to advance. She straight up said if your career means that much to you then go. She refuses to leave our area b/c of family. I then asked what if I go to field and come home every other weekend or every weekend if it is close enough (a bunch of people do that in our office) and she said no, she doesn't do long distance relationships. She called me selfish and I should want to be with her. I tried to explain at some point I will need to go to advance my career and I cant work at the same job and the same area my entire life and her response was just find another job in the area. She responded we can't just get married and buy/build a house and just turn around and sell it, that it makes no sense we might as just rent. I am not looking to move nor do I want to really atm. If I do I want to come back to the area eventually. I just feel if the opportunity for a better job or good experience was come along in a different area i should be able to take it or at least discuss the options at the time and have the ability to maybe take it but she is basically say no now. I know it is kind of hard to play the what if game but feel this is something we would talk about before we think of marriage which i have been thinking about.

TL;DR: G/F refuses to move away from her hometown for career advancement, even if it's just temporary, and says I should just find another job in the area. She calls me selfish and says we should just rent instead of buying/building a house. I feel like this is a major red flag and I'm not sure if I should continue to pursue a future with her.

---

This post is a great example of how a couple's differing values and priorities can cause tension in a relationship. The OP is willing to make sacrifices for his career, while his girlfriend is unwilling to leave her hometown for any reason. The OP feels like his girlfriend is being unreasonable and is causing him to question whether he should continue the relationship.

The post highlights the importance of communication and compromise in a relationship. The OP and his girlfriend need to have a more open and honest conversation about their priorities and what they are willing to sacrifice for each other. The OP needs to understand his girlfriend's reasons for not wanting to leave her hometown, and his girlfriend needs to understand the OP's desire for career advancement.

The post also raises questions about the importance of personal goals and aspirations in a relationship. The OP's career goals are important to him, and he feels like his girlfriend is not supporting him in achieving them. On the other hand, his girlfriend's desire to stay in her hometown is important to her, and she feels like the OP is not supporting her in achieving her goals.

Overall, this post is a great example of how relationships can be complex and challenging, and how couples need to work together to find a solution that works for both parties.

TITLE: I [27F] told my younger sister [18F] to break up with her toxic boyfriend [19M]. My parents are now mad at me for "breaking up the family."

POST: I could tell from the start my sister's new boyfriend was a toxic individual. I wanted to tell her to break up with him, but I was scared to do so. I built up the courage to tell her after 3 months. She was just in a fight with him, and I told her to break up with him because he was a toxic person, and she was just starting to realize that. The next day, she broke up with him.

When she told our parents that she broke up with him and I had really helped her, our mom was *furious.* She went off on me and yelled at me for about 10 minutes because I had "broken up the family" and that her boyfriend had been a perfectly nice person and was not toxic. Our father was on her side, but my 4 siblings (including the sister mentioned) were on my side. They said they had realized he was a toxic person, but hadn't spoken up.

Now, I don't know what to do about my parents. They're threatening to go no contact with me because I'm an embarrassment to the family. Do you have any advice for me, Reddit?

TL;DR: I told my 18-year-old sister to break up with her toxic boyfriend, and now my parents are mad at me for "breaking up the family." They're threatening to go no contact with me. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you did the right thing. It's great that you stood up for your sister and helped her see the truth about her boyfriend. Your parents are being ridiculous. You should stand your ground and tell them that you're not going to apologize for doing what was best for your sister."
* **u/smartcookie**: "I agree with throwaway123456. Your parents are being super unfair. You should talk to them and explain why you did what you did. Maybe they'll come around and understand your perspective."
* **u/relationshipadvice**: "I'm a relationship counselor, and I have to say, you did the right thing. It's great that you were able to help your sister see the truth about her boyfriend. As for your parents, it's possible that they're in denial about the boyfriend's toxicity. You should try to have a calm and rational conversation with them and explain why you did what you did."
* **u/anonymous123**: "I'm going through a similar situation with my own family. My parents are super controlling and manipulative, and they're always trying to dictate who I date. I think you should stand your ground and tell them that you're not going to apologize for doing what was best for your sister. You're an adult, and you have the right to make your own decisions."
* **u/throwaway789**: "I think you should try to find a compromise. Maybe you could talk to your parents and explain why you did what you did, and then try to find a way to repair your relationship with them. It's not worth losing your family over, but you also shouldn't apologize for doing what was best for your sister."

TITLE: 25[m] Need advice on dipping in family biz ink.

POST: For the record i've always been against doing this for obvious reasons.

Anyways- there's an employee at my Family business  that i've had my eye on for some time. I don't work there but I come in on a regular basis.

I want to ask her out but never do because:

*1. she's busy doing her job whenever i'm there

*2. I can't find an opportune private moment that won't make it fucking awkward for her and potentially embarass her (and me)

My question is.. would it be completely bush league of me to ask her out over a FB message?

... I have always been an in person type of guy but I literally cannot find an appropriate time to ask her out for a drink.

TL;DR: Want to ask out an employee at my family business, but can't find a good time or setting to do it in person. Should I ask her out over FB message?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's better to ask her out in person, even if it's awkward. It shows you're willing to take a chance and be genuine. FB message might come across as lazy or not really interested in getting to know her."
* "I agree with the above comment. If you're really interested in her, take the chance and ask her out in person. If she says no, at least you know where you stand. FB message is too impersonal and might come across as creepy."
* "I think it's okay to ask her out over FB message if you're really struggling to find a good time to talk to her in person. Just make sure to be respectful and clear about your intentions. You could say something like 'Hey, I've really enjoyed getting to know you at the family business and I was wondering if you'd like to grab a drink sometime?'"
* "I would say don't do it. It's your family business and you should be professional. Don't mix business with pleasure. It could create an uncomfortable work environment and potentially affect your relationship with your family."
* "I think it's a good idea to ask her out over FB message, especially if you're really struggling to find a good time to talk to her in person. Just make sure to be respectful and clear about your intentions. You could say something like 'Hey, I've really enjoyed getting to know you at the family business and I was wondering if you'd like to grab a drink sometime?'"

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'll take the plunge and ask her out over FB message. I'll make sure to be respectful and clear about my intentions. I'll also make sure to keep it professional and not let it affect my relationship with my family.

I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes! Thanks again for the advice!

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 1.5. Today, my girlfriend is modeling for the first time. How do I remain supportive without letting my jealousy ruin our relationship?

POST: A bit of background on myself: I am a photographer by trade.  Somewhat as a joke, my girlfriend has always playfully been very against my taking photos of her.  It hurt and annoyed me at first when she played coy, but eventually I just stopped trying to involve her in my work.   

She is a very attractive girl - to the point of being openly approached constantly whenever she's out at no matter the setting (work, etc).  That said, she grew into her good looks and somewhat enjoys the attention she gets now.  Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup she is a fan of.  Excited with the idea, she agreed.

At the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.  The photographer inside me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her.  The boy in me is jealous that she is so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me (taking photos) initially.  I'm also just not that comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online - perhaps a bit possessive/insecure, but I just don't love the idea of her half naked all over the internet and lastly... The boyfriend in me is being supportive and pushing her to do something she wants to even though I really feel bad about it.  

I don't want to push her away and I want to see her happy.  How do I deal with my own insecurities and jealousy with this situation.  She's at the shoot right now and having a great time.  I'm at home in knots.

TL;DR: My girlfriend is modeling for the first time and I'm struggling with jealousy, insecurity, and possessiveness. How do I remain supportive without letting my feelings ruin our relationship?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're struggling with your own insecurities more than anything. It's great that you're trying to be supportive, but maybe take a step back and think about why you're feeling this way. Is it because you're genuinely concerned about her or is it because you're worried about losing her attention? Once you figure that out, you can work on addressing those feelings and being a better partner to her."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work through them. It's normal to feel jealous or insecure in situations like this. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of this experience for her and how it can bring you closer together. You could also have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive and controlling. It's her choice to model and she's doing it because she wants to. You need to trust her and respect her decisions. If you're feeling jealous or insecure, maybe try to focus on your own insecurities and work on building your own confidence. It's not about her, it's about you."
* "I think it's great that you're trying to be supportive, but maybe try to focus on the fact that this is a great opportunity for her and how it can bring her confidence and self-esteem. You could also try to be more involved in the process and help her prepare for the shoot. This could be a great bonding experience for you both."
* "I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel jealous or insecure in situations like this. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of this experience and how it can bring you closer together. You could also try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling with feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and possessiveness after his girlfriend decides to model for a clothing company. He is torn between being supportive and his own feelings of discomfort with the idea of her being half-naked online. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from acknowledging his feelings and working through them to being more supportive and trusting of his girlfriend's decisions. Ultimately, the OP needs to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and work on building his own confidence and trust in their relationship.

TITLE: Me [18 M] and my girlfriend [16 F] are going to sleep together for the first time. I'm anxious.

POST: I'm a very anxious person in general, sometimes to an obsessive degree.

We've been together for over two years without having sex. At first she was too young (14) and now she wants a time when she is free of stress so she can be relaxed and not have to worry about anything else. The.. event itself will take place in about a month, after she finishes her exams. We've considered it now and then through the time we've been together but always decides to wait.

Now it isn't being put off any longer. And, while it has been a TORTUROUS wait for me (worth it, to be with someone like her), it suddenly seems... rather sudden and immediate. 

God knows I want to, and I definitely don't want to wait any longer, but at the same time I don't know how I'm going to be fully ready by the time it happens. 

I understand on an intellectual level that it is not that big a deal. Just sex, right? But emotionally it seems like a great deal more than that.

And I know that it is for her. We're very open in discussing these matters. To her this is a really big deal; her virginity is something she can only ever give to one person and she wants it to be meaningful. It's sharing a more intimate part of herself than she ever has before.

I understand and even agree with her. But that kind of adds pressure to the situation. I don't want to screw up and make her first time something she doesn't want to remember. And I don't know if worrying about it will just make it more likely to happen.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking here. As much a chance to just talk about it as possible,I guess; my only confidante aside from my girlfriend is asexual, and as such she can't give much input here. But do I really have anything to worry about? Just how badly CAN I screw this up? And is there anything I definitely, definitely shouldn't do?

TL;DR: I'm a 18-year-old guy who's going to sleep with his 16-year-old girlfriend for the first time. I'm anxious about it and want to talk about it. What am I worried about and how can I make it a good experience for both of us?

TITLE: I [21F] have deep feelings for my friend[23 M]. How to get over them and is it possible to still be friends?

POST: I met him in October last year at university. We immediately clicked and since we have the same major, we took the same classes. I think he liked me at first, he would text me all the time and ask me to hang out on weekends. He is a very nice guy and I really enjoyed his company and looked forward to getting his texts everyday.

At the beginning of this quarter, things started to change. He started texting me less and no longer asked me how my day was and that's when I realized that I have feelings for him, and it shocked me how intense they were. I was thinking about him 24/7 and it affected me in a negative way. I no longer wanted to hang out with anyone, I got bad grades in all my classes and I just slept all the time. The texting almost stopped right now. I still see at school everyday and we spend our breaks together, he's nice when I'm with him and still teases me and jokes around.

Right now, I don't know what to do and I'm not sure what he's thinking, I sometimes wonder if he just doesn't want spend our break time with me but is too nice to say so and I wonder if I pushed him away when I was having a hard time controlling my feelings when I'm around him by being cold and ignoring him. I want to stop thinking about him and move on. I really want to focus on school and get good grades since is not too late.
Distancing myself from him is not an option at this point since we are taking the same classes. Also, I can never be in a relationship with him because of some circumstances. How do I stop being so miserable all the time? How do I stop waiting for his texts when I know he won't be sending me anything? Is it possible to get over him and still be friends? He hasn't done anything wrong and it doesn't feel right to be mean to him. Please help me!!

TL;DR: I have deep feelings for my friend, but it's not possible for us to be in a relationship. I want to stop thinking about him and move on, but I'm not sure how. I still need to take classes with him and I don't want to be mean to him. Is it possible to get over him and still be friends?

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough to have feelings for someone who's not a good match for you. Here's what I would suggest: try to focus on your schoolwork and extracurricular activities. The more you're engaged in other things, the less you'll think about him. Also, try to talk to him about how you're feeling. Be honest with him and let him know that you have feelings for him, but you know it's not possible for you two to be together. He might appreciate your honesty and it could help clear the air. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way. And if that's the case, it's okay to still be friends. You can still care about someone even if you're not in a romantic relationship with them."

TITLE: My roommate has told me many disgusting band camp stories and so I'm curious: What are YOUR most horrifying stories from band and/or camp?

POST: The main story that stuck with me involved my roommate and this guy that everyone in the band absolutely hated. For the life of me, I can't remember his name, so I'll call him "Dave". Dave apparently was an asshole to everyone and if there's anything to take away from this story, it's to not piss off band geeks.

My roommate's high school band was traveling by bus to a school in a different city for a competition. Dave had been messing with the people in band all week and as a band member himself, would be accompanying them to the competition. The bus ride was going to take around 4-5 hours and a group of trombone guys (including my roommate) decided it would be a great opportunity to get back at Dave. They sneaked into the band room, opened Dave's trombone case, and stole his mouthpiece.

One by one, the guys took turns jacking off into it. One of the them stuck it up his ass. Another pissed on it.

They made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May. For 5 hours, that mouthpiece sat roasting in shit and piss and semen like a fetish-loving prostitute in the trunk of a car. When the bus finally stopped, Dave took it out and played his trombone as if not a single thing was wrong.

TL;DR: Roommate's high school band stole Dave's mouthpiece, filled it with jizz and piss, and left it in the bus for 5 hours. Dave played his trombone with it.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "I'm not sure what's more disturbing, the fact that they did it or that Dave didn't notice anything was wrong"
* "I'm a band geek and I'm cringing so hard right now"
* "I'm not sure if I should be impressed by the creativity or horrified by the sheer audacity"
* "I'm just going to assume that Dave was a serial killer and this was just a cover for his true intentions"
* "I'm not sure if I should be more concerned about the health risks or the sheer depravity of the situation"
* "I'm just going to assume that this is a metaphor for something deeper and more profound"
* "I'm not sure if I should be laughing or crying, but I'm definitely going to be having nightmares about this for weeks"
* "I'm just going to assume that this is a cautionary tale about the dangers of being an asshole in band camp"

This post has sparked a heated discussion about the most disgusting and horrifying stories from band camp and/or camp in general.

TITLE: My thoughts on my own Christmas this year - am I doing the right thing?

POST: Firstly - sorry for the 'downer' on a day like today - just really on my mind.

Well Reddit, another year has come around and its Christmas - I work in retail so I'm surrounded by people that are talking about doing everything with the family and friends, buying presents for everyone, so on and so fourth.

With my career, and it being my own choice, I sometimes have to move to different places to manage stores, its still a yes/no choice but to move up its something that I have to do and shouldn't really say NO to, as its something that is somewhat required of you (see of it as, what are you willing to give up to get a chance of a life time) - although I'm starting to think just how much of my own life am I giving up to chase my dreams?

I don't live with my family anymore, and I'm roughly 1200km from them (not much, I know, but we are talking about $600 in flights, possibly more for return) - my girlfriend is now even further away, and shits getting pretty tough there too with the distance and not being able to be there for each other.

I left most of my friends, and rarely hear from them now (could be partly my fault not speaking to them either, but frankly I'm pretty busy most of the time and we just end up drifting apart).

So reddit, without giving you the entire life story, I ask for your guidance:

My job could potentially give me (X) amount of money to live comfortably for the rest of my life, filling a dream that I fill I would love to achieve - but in the process losing the closeness of friends, family and loved ones - but possibly getting them back in the end?

Or do I get out now, move back to family and loved ones (in an area possibly without as good job prospects and in some ways settle for'second best' or have to work even harder to get where I want to be?

If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them - I mean, I don't have anything to do today on Christmas, right? I'm alone and self reflecting!

TL;DR: I'm a retail manager, I'm 1200km away from family, girlfriend is even further away, I'm considering leaving job for family/friends but it might mean settling for less in life. What do you think I should do?

TITLE: Me [30 M] with my wife [27 F] of several months, and a tax disagreement?

POST: I'll do my best to keep this concise.

My wife has a chronic illness. As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.

Our state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.

The trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer. Long story short, she's going to lie on her taxes and file as "Single" and obviously I have to as well. 

I am incredibly uncomfortable with lying on my taxes but both she and her mom (who was, to be fair, a tax attorney) think it should be okay for one year. I would imagine most people wouldn't lie to say they were *single* on their taxes, so I guess there's that.

I don't see a realistic way for us to afford coverage through my employer, unfortunately. I'd love for this to be a "put my foot down" moment but if that results in her losing coverage I don't think I can justify it.

We all have to make sacrifices in marriage... is this a reasonable one for me to make? I guess worst-case scenario is we get caught and busted for a large fine. Which puts us back on square one (or square 0.5, due to the fines...)

TL;DR: Wife has chronic illness, needs health insurance, qualifies for subsidies on the market, but would lose those if she gets coverage through my employer. We'd have to lie on our taxes to keep her coverage. I'm uncomfortable with this, but I don't see a realistic alternative.

---

This post is a great example of a complex issue that can arise in a relationship. The OP (original poster) is struggling with the decision to lie on his taxes to ensure his wife receives health insurance coverage. He is torn between his own moral principles and the need to support his wife's health and well-being.

The post highlights the challenges that can arise when individuals have different values and priorities in a relationship. The OP's wife and her mom believe that lying on their taxes for one year is acceptable, while the OP is uncomfortable with the idea.

The post also raises questions about the importance of honesty and integrity in a relationship. The OP is worried about the potential consequences of lying on their taxes, including the possibility of being caught and fined. He is also concerned about the impact that this decision could have on their relationship and his own sense of self-worth.

The post has received a range of responses from the Reddit community, with some people arguing that the OP should prioritize his wife's health and well-being over his own moral principles, while others believe that honesty and integrity are essential in a relationship. The post has sparked a lively and thought-provoking discussion about the complexities of relationships and the difficult decisions that couples may face.

TITLE: I [F24] am not looking for a relationship, but am infatuated with my coworker [M26]

POST: I [F24] moved overseas for work about 18 months ago, breaking up with my boyfriend of 5 years to do so. I'm convinced the break up was the right thing to do, but it's hit us both very hard and I don't feel ready to move on yet.

When I started working at my new job, I immediately noticed that one of my coworkers, Mark [M26] was pretty cute, but didn't give it much more thought. The two of us are the youngest members of our team by a significant margin. We happen to come from the same country, he's been here for about 3 years. There aren't many young single women in my industry, so for the first few months I was swamped with suitors, but Mark (as is proper for a coworker) never showed any sign of interest.

About 6 months ago my team moved offices, and I had to start sharing an office with Mark. Naturally we started to casually chat more once we were crammed in the same 12 square yards for 9 hours a day, and I've slowly started to develop an irrational infatuation with him. I get unjustifiably upset if he calls in sick for the day, or even just shows up a little late in the mornings. He's perfectly friendly with me, but has never shown any sign of wanting to have any social interaction outside of a work context (I do meet with other coworkers outside of work sometimes). He's straight but been single the whole time I've been working here.

This infatuation is stupid, I'm not ready to start dating again, I know that coworkers are totally a no-go zone, he's shown no interest in me, and I don't actually think we'd even be particularly compatible. I haven't let my infatuation get in the way of my work, if anything I'm working longer hours because he tends to leave later than I would otherwise. I know I have to get over him, but I just don't know how to go about it since rationally I don't want to look for or get into any kind of non-platonic relationship with any guy right now. Advice, please!

TL;DR: I'm not looking for a relationship, but I've developed an irrational infatuation with my coworker. I know it's stupid, but I don't know how to get over him since we work together and I don't want to look for or get into any kind of non-platonic relationship right now.

**Comments:**

1. "I think you're being really honest with yourself about your feelings, and that's a great start. Maybe try to focus on your work and hobbies outside of work to take your mind off of him? Also, have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling? Sometimes just sharing your emotions with a trusted friend or family member can help you process and move on."
2. "I'm not sure if you're aware, but it's actually pretty common for people to develop feelings for their coworkers. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be tricky to navigate. Have you considered talking to Mark about how you're feeling? It might be a good way to clear the air and see if there's any mutual interest. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way."
3. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to have feelings for someone, even if you're not ready to act on them. Just try to focus on your own happiness and well-being, and don't worry too much about what Mark thinks. You're not going to find someone who's perfect for you if you're not happy with yourself first."
4. "I'm a bit surprised you're not considering a friendship with Mark. Sometimes having a close friend can be really fulfilling, and it might help you get over your infatuation. Just make sure you're being genuine and not just trying to get closer to him because you have feelings for him."
5. "I think you should try to focus on your own personal growth and development. What are your goals and aspirations? What do you want to achieve in your career and personal life? Focusing on your own goals and aspirations can help you move on from your feelings for Mark and find a sense of fulfillment and purpose."

TITLE: I'm great at small talk, but how do I move past that?

POST: Reddit, I'm great on first and second dates when a lot of it is asking questions and getting to know about the other person. In fact, I love meeting new people because I'm pretty decent at small talk. After the first or second date though, I seem to run into a wall about what to talk about. 

Is this a problem of just 'chemistry' (fuck, how does it work)? I'm great hanging out with friends and with girls that are in that damned friend zone. I just can't seem to make it work on a one-on-one setting with a girl I'm interested in, in a date situation. I'm just wondering if anyone had any tips out there. Thanks!

(Note: I have been in relationships before (21 years old), but I feel that this seems to be part of the reason why they don't go anywhere and just kind of fizzle out.)

TL;DR: I'm great at small talk, but struggle to move past that on one-on-one dates. Any tips on how to keep the conversation going and build a deeper connection with someone?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think the problem is that you're focusing too much on the 'getting to know each other' aspect and not enough on the 'getting to know each other on a deeper level' aspect. Try asking more open-ended questions that encourage sharing and vulnerability. For example, instead of asking 'what do you like to do for fun?', ask 'what's something that's been on your mind lately?' or 'what's something you're passionate about?'"
2. **u/username1234**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People are more attracted to authenticity than trying to be someone they think they should be. Also, try to find common ground and talk about things you both enjoy. It's not about being 'deep' or'meaningful' all the time, it's about having a good time and getting to know each other."
3. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I think you're overthinking it. Just be yourself, be respectful, and show genuine interest in getting to know the other person. Don't try to'make it work' or 'force' a connection. If it's meant to be, it will happen naturally. And if it doesn't, that's okay too. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."
4. **u/username5678**: "I think you're focusing too much on the 'date' aspect and not enough on the 'getting to know each other' aspect. Try to find activities or hobbies you both enjoy and do them together. This can help create a sense of camaraderie and shared experience, which can be a great way to build a connection. Also, don't be afraid to be a little silly or goofy. People are more likely to relax and be themselves around someone who can make them laugh."
5. **u/throwawayaccount456**: "I think you're putting too much emphasis on'moving past' small talk. Small talk is a natural part of getting to know someone, and it's okay to take things slow. Don't try to rush the process or force a connection. Just enjoy the time you're spending together and see where things go naturally. And if it doesn't work out, that's okay too. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."

**Common themes:**

* Relax and be yourself
* Focus on building a connection rather than trying to'make it work'
* Ask open-ended questions to encourage sharing and vulnerability
* Find common ground and talk about things you both enjoy
* Don't put too much pressure on yourself or the situation
* Take things slow and see where things go naturally

**Lessons learned:**

* Small talk is a natural part of getting to know someone, and it's okay to take things slow
* Focus on building a connection rather than trying to'make it work'
* Be yourself and don't try to be someone you're not
* Ask open-ended questions to encourage sharing and vulnerability
* Find common ground and talk about things you both enjoy
* Don't put too much pressure on yourself or the situation
* Take things slow and see where things go naturally.

TITLE: Put a deposit for a Kitten way back, found out I'm allergic to Cats. Advice?

POST: Okay I believed that I was not allergic to anything after being told by my parents and everyone in my family that I do not have allergies and had tests done.

I put down a deposit for a Ragdoll Kitten, $350 for something not even born yet.
Now I just found out I'm allergic to Cat Dander. 

I don't know what to do. I want to get a refund but I'm first gonna ask you guys and do research. Should I get a Ragdoll even if I am allergic? I've heard all stuff about them being great cats for people with allergies and I heard the exact opposite as well. I know Cat Dander comes from saliva. 

I fell in love with Ragdoll Cats so this is just difficult for me to come to terms with. 

I just need extra insight and advice.

TL;DR: Put a deposit for a Ragdoll Kitten, found out I'm allergic to Cat Dander, unsure what to do.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/CatLady99**: "I'm so sorry to hear this! Ragdolls are amazing cats, but if you're allergic, it's not worth it. You should definitely ask for a refund. Don't worry, there are plenty of other breeds that might be suitable for you. Have you considered hypoallergenic breeds like Sphynx or Devon Rex?"
2. **u/FelineFanatic**: "I understand your love for Ragdolls, but allergies are a serious issue. You should prioritize your health. If you're allergic, it's not worth the risk. I'd recommend looking into breeds that are known to be hypoallergenic. You might also consider getting a HEPA air purifier to help reduce the allergen levels in your home."
3. **u/CatLover3000**: "I'm a cat lover, but I'm also allergic. I've found that some breeds are better suited for people with allergies than others. Ragdolls are not typically considered hypoallergenic, but there are other breeds that might be. Have you considered breeds like the Balinese or the Oriental Shorthair? They're both known to produce less dander than other breeds."
4. **u/AllergyWarrior**: "I'm an allergy sufferer myself, and I can tell you that it's not worth risking your health for a cat. Even with hypoallergenic breeds, there's still a chance you'll react to the allergens. I'd recommend exploring other options, like getting a different pet or finding ways to reduce your exposure to allergens. Your health is more important than any pet."
5. **u/CatRescue**: "I'm a cat rescue volunteer, and I've seen many people who thought they were allergic to cats, only to find out they were just sensitive to certain breeds. If you're really set on getting a cat, you might consider fostering a cat to see how you react before committing to a specific breed. This way, you can get a feel for what it's like to have a cat in your home without breaking the bank or committing to a specific breed."

TITLE: Difficult situation. I (m29) am in love with one of my best friends (f28).

POST: Here's my situation:

I am in love with my good friend and coworker. We've both worked at the same ad agency in NYC for several years and over that time have developed a really solid friendship. We often talk, half-jokingly, about how we should travel together. Now there is a chance that our company might send us both abroad to work on a project together. I know she also really values our friendship, but I can't tell if her feelings go any deeper than that, like mine do.

Things are a little complicated by the fact that as long as I've known her she's had a long-term boyfriend, except for a short period last year when they took a "break".  It's also complicated because we're all part of the same friend group so I often have to see them together, which is usually torture for me. I'm not exactly buddies with her bf, but we have many friends in common. 

So, what do I do?  Do I just tell her how I feel and risk alienating myself from our group and possibly losing her as a friend (while still having to work with her)?  Do I wait and hope that things eventually fizzle out for good with her bf? Or do I just accept that I might never be with her and try to enjoy the strong friendship we have.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL;DR: I'm in love with my best friend and coworker, but she's in a long-term relationship and we're part of the same friend group. I'm torn between telling her how I feel and risking everything, or waiting and hoping things change, or just accepting that I might never be with her.

This post is an example of a difficult situation that many people can relate to. The OP (original poster) is torn between his feelings for his best friend and the potential consequences of revealing his emotions. He is worried about losing his friend and the friendship they have built over the years, as well as the potential awkwardness of working with her in the future.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the situation. The OP is seeking advice from the community, which is a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit. The post is likely to receive a range of responses, from people who have been in similar situations to those who have advice on how to navigate the situation.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "Be honest with her and see how she feels. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep your feelings hidden and potentially ruin the friendship."
* "Wait and see how things play out with her boyfriend. If they're having issues or if the relationship is struggling, it might be a good time to make your move."
* "Accept that you might never be with her and focus on maintaining the friendship. It's better to have a strong and healthy friendship than to risk losing it over romantic feelings."
* "Consider talking to a trusted friend or therapist about your feelings. They may be able to offer you some valuable perspective and advice."

Overall, this post is a great example of the types of situations that people can face in their personal lives, and the importance of seeking advice and support from others.

TITLE: My 12 year old brother recently confessed that he was molested by his doctor. My mother does not want to press charges because she doesn't want to put him through any more trauma; I think it is better to deal with it now. Reddit, how can I convince my mom to press charges against this doctor?

POST: Throwaway acct.

6 months ago, my younger brother explained to my mom that he found the doctor that he had his sports physical with "creepy" and that he didn't want to go back to him again.  He explained that the doctor had touched him for a long time, but my mom thought that it was just his reaction to having his first physical without her in the room.  6 months later, after learning of similar charges being brought against the doctor by others, my mom talked to him and he confessed that he knew what the doctor had done was wrong, and that it had really scared him.  I won't go into any details, but what he described was indisputably molestation.  My mom is afraid to press charges because she doesn't want him to have to describe the situation any more than he already has.  Personally, I think that not dealing with this now is going to really fuck him up down the road.  Reddit, do you side with my mom, or me on this?  If there are any professional lawyers, psychologists, etc that have dealt with this, what is the right decision right now?

TL;DR: My 12 year old brother was molested by his doctor, and my mom doesn't want to press charges because she doesn't want him to have to relive the experience. I think it's better to deal with it now and get justice. Reddit, what do you think?

---

This post is an example of a situation where a family member is torn between their own feelings and the feelings of their loved one. The author is advocating for their brother's well-being and safety, while their mother is prioritizing their son's emotional well-being. The post raises important questions about the balance between justice and trauma, and how to make decisions that prioritize the well-being of all parties involved.

The post also highlights the importance of believing and supporting survivors of sexual abuse, and the need for a supportive and non-judgmental environment for them to come forward and share their experiences. The author's concern for their brother's well-being and their desire to see justice served is understandable, and it is important to consider the potential long-term effects of not pursuing charges against the doctor.

The post also raises questions about the role of law enforcement and the legal system in addressing sexual abuse. The author's mother is hesitant to press charges because she does not want her son to have to relive the experience, but it is important to consider the potential benefits of pursuing charges, such as holding the perpetrator accountable and potentially preventing future abuse.

Overall, this post highlights the complexity of situations involving sexual abuse and the need for a nuanced and compassionate approach to addressing these issues. It also underscores the importance of believing and supporting survivors, and the need for a supportive and non-judgmental environment for them to come forward and share their experiences.

TITLE: How do you deal with people who are trying to have a life competition with you?

POST: I am in college, and am a photographer, I had this girl last year who I became friends with because we were both into photography, she asked me many questions, tips, advice all that stuff because I had been doing it longer and I was completely ready to share everything with her, while not really gaining anything in return accept a kind of satisfaction from someone wanting my help.  

She now constantly talks down to me, not just about photography but about everything, and literally just treats me like shit unless it suits her to do otherwise (basically never) I have a hard time being a bitch, and I always end up just being nice when I want to stand up for myself.  She has literally shoved everything about her life that I don't have in my face her family/friends/home/money/boyfriend (she has rich parents/family who have bought her every piece of equipment she has and paid her way through school, this only bothers me because I have worked very hard for what little I have, and she always whines about money, while I often am broke and rarely bring up financial problems)  

She is also (after having done photography for only 6 months) getting paid work, I have yet to have this, and it really is sheer luck but the very first "collaboration" we did together she had a model and invited me along (all fine) I said "hey I know this awesome spot, and I have all this paint, and here is some awesome stuff we could do!" then she posted all her photos before I did and didnt mention me so everyone thinks I copied her, and it has worked that way for many things to follow and I am just wondering how you people deal with being enraged at someone who you cannot avoid, also I think if I blatantly stop talking to her the rest of the people around us will think I am the one being a bitch, which also bothers me, what do I do?

TL;DR: I have a "friend" who constantly talks down to me, treats me like shit, and always tries to one-up me. She's getting paid work as a photographer, while I'm still struggling to get my foot in the door. I'm at a loss for how to deal with her and her constant competition.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think you're being too nice. You don't have to be friends with someone who treats you like crap. If you can't avoid her, then just be polite and distant. Don't engage with her negativity. You don't owe her anything, including your time and energy. Remember that you're not responsible for her behavior, only your own."
2. **u/photogirl88**: "I'm a photographer too, and I can totally relate to what you're going through. First of all, congratulations on being a good friend and sharing your knowledge with her. However, it's clear that she's not reciprocating that kindness. I would suggest setting boundaries with her. Tell her that you're not comfortable with her constant criticism and negativity. If she continues to treat you poorly, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
3. **u/throwawayaccount99**: "I think you're giving her too much power. You're letting her get to you and make you feel bad about yourself. Remember that her behavior is a reflection of her own insecurities, not yours. You're a talented photographer and you have a lot to offer. Don't let her bring you down. Keep doing what you're doing and focus on your own goals and aspirations."
4. **u/photographylover**: "I would suggest taking a step back and reevaluating the friendship. Ask yourself if it's truly worth your time and energy. If not, then it might be time to distance yourself from her. Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and if she's not willing to do that, then she's not a good friend for you."
5. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I think you should try to focus on your own goals and aspirations, rather than comparing yourself to her. You're a talented photographer and you have a lot to offer. Don't let her bring you down. Keep doing what you're doing and focus on your own success. Remember that success is not a competition, and you don't have to compare yourself to others to be happy."



**Key Takeaways:**

1. Set boundaries with the person who is treating you poorly.
2. Don't engage with their negativity and criticism.
3. Focus on your own goals and aspirations, rather than comparing yourself to others.
4. Remember that their behavior is a reflection of their own insecurities, not yours.
5. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and if someone is not willing to do that, then they are not a good friend for you.

TITLE: My girlfriend[18/F] of 1 month, told me[19/M] that she doesn't believe in love, but I do!

POST: So I've known this girl for about 3 months. She blew me away from the minute I first met her in my friends house. We hung out a lot (4/5 nights a week) over summer, just as friends. I asked her out about 1+1/2 months ago and things are going good!

But there's one thing that has been bugging me. She openly admitted to me about 2 months ago that she doesn't believe in love. She said she thought she was in love in a previous relationship, but now realizes she wasn't at all.

This is bugging me because I know I'm very capable of loving another person. I'm worried that if I grow to love her after a while, she won't feel the same.

Is this an opinion that a lot of people have about love? Do you think I can change her opinion? Or do you think I'm wasting my time and I'm asking for my heart to be broken?

.. I'd rather clear this in my mind while I'm still in the early stages..

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 1 month doesn't believe in love, but I do. Worried about the future and if she'll ever feel the same way.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not uncommon for people to have different views on love. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it's definitely something to consider. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Maybe she'll surprise you and have a different perspective on love than she initially let on." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about this now, rather than later. It's always better to have these conversations early on. Just remember that you can't change someone's beliefs or opinions, but you can have a discussion about them. Maybe she'll learn something new about love, or maybe she'll help you see things from a different perspective." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I'm not sure if you can change her opinion on love, but you can definitely try to understand where she's coming from. Ask her why she doesn't believe in love and what experiences led her to that conclusion. Maybe there's something you can learn from her perspective, and maybe you can find common ground. Just be careful not to pressure her into changing her mind, as that can be damaging to the relationship." (u/loveandrelationships)
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the 'love' aspect. What's important is that you both have a connection and are happy together. If she doesn't believe in love, that's okay. You can still have a great relationship without it. Just focus on building a strong bond with her and see where things go." (u/relationshipgoals)

**Reddit's Relationship Advice:**

TITLE: I (27F) have a question for you about the landmarks in your relationship(s).

POST: *Not sure if this belongs here, but /r/relationships does not allow general questions, so....help me out please!*

I've been dating my SO (34M) for about a month so I don't need to worry overly much about this right away, but I like to be prepared. I'm looking for the time frames that you experienced with landmarks in your relationships, to give me a ballpark. Examples include:

- When did you exchange keys?
- When did you first say "I love you"?
- When did you start to feel like your respective homes were a place you could "feel at home", i.e. you would do dishes or help with chores even though the place wasn't your own?
- When did you start farting around each other?

Things like that. What do you consider landmarks? When did they happen?

We spend most of our time at my place for convenience and he seems to fit in to my home nicely. He is comfortable making breakfast or doing dishes and has offered to help with other chores if I happen to need to do them when he's over. So far I've turned down his offer to help with other chores, but I do appreciate the gesture.

I have a history of moving in too soon, so I know I need to wait QUITE a while before I ever even consider that move. Like, over a year. At least. I just don't know how the rest of it should/could play out. I do expect some widely varied answers, so any details as to why you think it was good timing/later than normal/sooner than normal would be much appreciated.

We started farting around each other almost immediately. What a relief!

TL;DR: I'm looking for general guidelines on the timing of landmarks in relationships. When did you exchange keys? Say "I love you"? Start feeling at home in each other's spaces? Start farting around each other? Any other notable events? I'm trying to gauge how my relationship is progressing and what to expect in the future.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're thinking about this ahead of time! For me, exchanging keys happened around 6-8 months in. Saying 'I love you' was around 3-4 months in. Feeling at home in each other's spaces took a bit longer, around 9-12 months. And farting around each other... well, that happened pretty quickly too. I think it's all about getting to know each other and feeling comfortable in each other's presence."
* "I'm a bit of an outlier, but I exchanged keys with my partner after only 2 months. We were both in a rush to move in together, and it worked out great for us. Saying 'I love you' was around 4 months in. Feeling at home in each other's spaces took a bit longer, around 6-8 months. And farting around each other... well, that happened pretty quickly too. I think it's all about finding what works for you and your partner."
* "I think it's great that you're taking your time and not rushing into things. For me, exchanging keys happened around 12-18 months in. Saying 'I love you' was around 9-12 months in. Feeling at home in each other's spaces took a bit longer, around 18-24 months. And farting around each other... well, that happened pretty quickly too. I think it's all about building a strong foundation and taking things slow."

**TL;DR:** The comments provide a range of responses, with some people exchanging keys and saying "I love you" within a few months, while others took longer. Feeling at home in each other's spaces and farting around each other seemed to happen more quickly. The general consensus is that it's all about getting to know each other and finding what works for you and your partner. Some people emphasized the importance of taking things slow and building a strong foundation, while others noted that rushing into things can work out well too. The OP seems to be taking a cautious approach, waiting at least a year before considering moving in together.

TITLE: I love my wife [29/f] but I feel like something is missing [28/m].

POST: I have been married for about 3 years now and I absolutely love my wife. She has been the best partner I have ever had. We have had ups and downs but we always seem to work things out and we have a healthy sex life. Things are going well but I just can not seem to shake the feeling that I want more. I have lived a prim and proper, mostly conservative lifestyle up until my later years in college. I got a taste of different types of lifestyles and I have always been amazed by them. My wife was the typical break away who decided to distance herself from her family and enjoy any experience she could. There have been tales of hitchhiking with hippys and free love and all that. She has a view of people that I never had (I have been fairly cynical) and it has enabled her to meet some very interesting people from all walks of life and allowed her to make very intimate connections with these people. Well she eventually met me and she changed my outlook on the world. 

We were married right after we both graduated from college and we have taken up a fairly traditional lifestyle. She has mostly transitioned away from the past. After I had a brief chance to experience what she had experienced and after all of her stories, I was a bit jealous. I feel like our marriage has cut me off from having those intimate experiences with anyone other than her. There is a sexual aspect to this but it is also about simple intimacy. Neither of us hinder each other in the formation of new friendships but sometimes I wish we could have more. We have briefly discussed additions in the bedroom but I have never been sure if she was actually interested or if it was just her indulging me. Plus, neither of us would know where to start. I have not really discussed this with her because I don't want to hurt her and she has a way of avoiding discussions like this. 

I have maintained the status quo and told myself that those times were over. I thought I would move on from it but even several years later I can not shake the feeling that I have repressed something within myself.

TL;DR: I'm a 28-year-old man married to a 29-year-old woman for 3 years. I love her, but I feel like something is missing. I had a brief taste of a more free-spirited lifestyle and now I'm jealous of the intimacy she had with others. I want to explore this aspect of myself, but I'm afraid of hurting her and don't know where to start.

---

This post is a great example of a common phenomenon in relationships: the feeling of restlessness or discontent that can arise when one partner has had experiences or exposure to different lifestyles or relationships that the other partner has not. In this case, the husband is feeling envious of the wife's past experiences and the intimacy she had with others, and is struggling to reconcile this with his own desire for a more traditional and monogamous relationship.

The post highlights the importance of open and honest communication in relationships, as the husband is hesitant to discuss his feelings with his wife due to fear of hurting her. It also raises questions about the nature of intimacy and what it means to be fulfilled in a relationship.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* Encouragement to have an open and honest conversation with the wife about his feelings and desires.
* Suggestions for ways to explore and satisfy his desire for intimacy and connection without necessarily involving other people.
* Acknowledgement that it's normal to feel restless or discontent in a relationship from time to time, and that it's okay to acknowledge and work through these feelings.
* Concerns about the potential impact on the relationship if the husband's desires are not addressed and fulfilled.

TITLE: Me [23/f] have been seeing someone [26/M] for a couple months and not sure how to move forward.

POST: I've been talking to someone for about two months now, maybe less. I'm not the best at dating and what not, such as knowing what happens. Especially online dating. We have met already and have hung out multiple times as well as gone on a date or two. Our hang outs have been dinner, movies, and other random stuff, but we've only really been on one or two dates. The other times were with other people, so it wasn't really one-on-one. I've slept over his place a couple times, but have only had sex once. We used to talk every day, but more recently it has been every other day or every couple days. Which is fine, we have busy lives. He especially has a very busy life. 

However, I'm not sure how dating really goes. I'm not really sure what he wants, nor am I sure how to bring it up in a conversation. I deactivated my dating profile a few weeks ago because I came back to over 100 messages one day and there was no one I was really into. Also, I was a bit hung up on this guy. I recently just reactivated it, due to boredom and unsure if this guy was into me, and I've noticed he's online almost every night. I'm very much into him, but not sure if he feels the same. I'm not sure when in the "talking" stage, I bring this up. It seems like he is into me and I sort of had a conversation with him the other night where he said he wasn't interested in a booty call. 

Am I overthinking it or should I just let it happen and see where it takes me? Do you think I should bring it up? Do you think it's too early to think about this stuff? Give me your advice.

I'm terrible at dating.

TL;DR: I've been seeing someone for a couple months, we've hung out and gone on a few dates, but I'm not sure how to move forward or if he's interested in me. I'm thinking of bringing it up, but I'm not sure if it's too early or if I'm overthinking it.

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're already in a relationship with this guy. You've slept over at his place, had sex, and have been talking regularly. It's not like you're just casually dating. I think it's time to have a conversation with him about where you both see this going. You can't keep wondering if he's interested in you forever. Just be honest and open with him about your feelings and see what he says."
2. **DatingIsHard**: "I think you're overthinking it. You've been seeing each other for a couple months, you've had sex, and you've been talking regularly. That's a pretty good foundation for a relationship. Just relax and see where things go. If he's not interested in you, he'll let you know. And if he is interested, he'll probably start making more of an effort to see you and spend time with you. Don't put too much pressure on it."
3. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I think you should bring it up, but not in a confrontational way. Try to have a casual conversation with him about your feelings and see where it goes. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've really been enjoying spending time with you lately. I was wondering if you've been thinking about us as a couple or if you're just looking for something casual.' That way, you're not putting too much pressure on him, but you're still getting a sense of where he stands."
4. **SkepticalSarah**: "I think you're getting ahead of yourself. You've only been dating for a couple months, and you're already thinking about labels and commitment. Take a step back and focus on getting to know each other better. See if you can have some deeper conversations and learn more about each other's values and goals. That way, you'll have a better sense of whether or not you're compatible in the long term."
5. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: "I think you should be honest with yourself about your feelings and what you want from this relationship. If you're looking for something serious, then you need to have a conversation with him about it. But if you're just looking for something casual, then you need to be okay with that too. Don't put pressure on him to be something he's not, and don't get upset if he doesn't feel the same way. Just be honest and open, and see where things go."

TITLE: Me [30 F] with my dad [60 M]. Useless relationship.

POST: Not sure if I posted in the right subreddit...

I've always felt like my whole life that my dad has hated me and not wanted to be a part of my life.  I can't even 
say, "hi." to him without it being weird.  I have never had a full conversation with him.  When I was younger he 
was an asshole to my mom to the point even family couldn't believe she put up with him.  Like, he's an arrogant 
dickhead.  He thinks he's fucking perfect and never makes mistakes.  He has no problem calling anyone stupid for 
any reason.  I'm 30.  I didn't live with my parents from 18 to 28.. Recently had to move back because I couldn't 
afford to live anywhere else.  It's so weird that we can't even say, "hi" but he'll gladly yell at me for random 
things.  I asked my sister recently if she felt the same way as me and she did.  I also asked my mom if he even 
wanted children.  She said he did but I don't believe her.  I just feel like what the hell did I do to make you 
hate me??  I talk to friends about this weird relationship and actually have one that has a similar one but 
everyone else doesn't.  I still even try to do nice things for him!  Hate myself for that... so I stopped. 
It's pretty pathetic, I'm trying to not even acknowledge him anymore.

TL;DR: My dad is a jerk and I feel like he hates me.  We can't even say hi without it being weird.  I'm 30 and 
still living with him because I can't afford it.  I feel like I did something wrong to make him hate me.  I'm 
trying to distance myself from him.

REPLIES:

* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your dad has some serious issues and it's not your 
fault.  You deserve better than to be treated like this.  Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? 
It might help you process your feelings and gain some closure.
* I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like your dad is a toxic person and you don't deserve to be treated like 
this.  You're not alone, many people have similar experiences with their parents.  Have you considered setting 
boundaries with him?  It might be hard, but it could help you feel more in control of the situation.

TITLE: I'm leaving my boyfriend of three years because he refuses to flush the toilet and wash his hands.

POST: My boyfriend and I are best friends, and I've never had stronger feelings for another individual. Three months ago we got a place together, and I'm already regretting it.

The burping, I can handle. The farting, I can live with. But I will no longer put up with his terrible hygiene (or lack of it). I constantly feel disgusted and uncomfortable in my own home. Every time I step into the bathroom, I get to see his bodily fluids in the toilet. And he never washes his hands, even after taking a shit, unless I tell him to. Like a three-year-old child, I have to tell him to wash his fucking hands, or else I refuse to let him touch me or come near me.

I don't understand why it's so difficult to do. ~~If he really loved me, he'd want me to live in a comfortable and safe environment, right?~~ I've talked with him about it so many times that it's like he doesn't understand words (and he's not a stupid man; in fact, I'd consider him to be the most intelligent person I've met). He'll say "okay", the conversation will end, but then he'll "forget".

TL;DR: I'm leaving my boyfriend of three years because he refuses to flush the toilet and wash his hands after using the bathroom.

---

This post is a prime example of a relationship issue that may seem trivial to some, but is a significant concern for the OP. The OP is frustrated and disgusted by their boyfriend's lack of hygiene, which is affecting their comfort and safety in their own home. The boyfriend's refusal to change his behavior, despite the OP's repeated requests, has led the OP to feel unheard and unvalued.

The post highlights the importance of communication and compromise in relationships. The OP feels that their boyfriend's behavior is a sign of disrespect and lack of consideration for their feelings and well-being. The boyfriend, on the other hand, may not see the issue as a big deal or may not understand why it's causing such distress for the OP.

The post also raises questions about the importance of personal hygiene in relationships. While it may seem like a minor issue to some, poor hygiene can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on individuals. The OP's feelings of disgust and discomfort are understandable, and it's reasonable for them to expect their partner to prioritize their well-being and comfort.

The post has received a mixed response from the Reddit community, with some users defending the boyfriend's behavior and others supporting the OP's decision to leave. Some users have shared their own experiences with similar issues, while others have offered advice on how to address the problem. The post has sparked a lively discussion about the importance of communication, compromise, and personal hygiene in relationships.

TITLE: Me [28F] with my new friend/crush [31M] of one month, he has been showing obvious signs of interest towards me for the past month. Two days ago he told me he has a long-distance girlfriend. So confused, Reddit help!

POST: A little background about myself: I have not been in a serious relationship since I was 21 and have only dated casually since then. I am open, available and looking for a more long-term relationship.

About a month ago, I started hanging out with this guy who I've discovered to be the most caring, kind, and encouraging individual that's been in my life recently. Signs started to show early that there was some kind of attraction between us. Here are some things that have happened in the last month (some still happening):

-prolonged eye contact and lots of easy, fun conversation
-prolonged or tight hugging
-after saying goodbye, our eyes often meet once more before departure (with smiles)
-texting everyday starting in the morning and lasting into the evening
-he has said things like "you are the nicest person I have ever met", "I see you as one of the people who will always be in my life"
-while on a weekend trip with friends, he threw his arm around me while sleeping (multiple friends sharing a bed)
-he said he would treat me to dinner (which he then turned into a group thing)

A couple days ago he told me he would be gone the next week because he was going to see his girlfriend (who lives six hours drive away) and expressed that they have been having difficulties for the past six months due to the long-distance. I learned that they have been together for 3+ years. 

I love that he shows an interest in me but realistically I feel that it is unfair and that I'm being led on. I'm scared to say something because I don't want the attention to stop, but I know I am in a vulnerable position. I secretly want him to break up with his girlfriend. Reddit, any advice is welcome, please!

TL;DR: I've been hanging out with a guy for a month, showing signs of interest, but he told me he has a long-distance girlfriend. I'm torn between wanting to continue the attention and feeling like I'm being led on. Help!

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345678**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's not ready to commit to you or his girlfriend. You deserve better than someone who's leading you on. It's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. You don't owe him anything, and you shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to prioritize your own feelings."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's not uncommon for people to have feelings for multiple people at once, but it's not okay to lead someone on. If he's not willing to be honest with you about his feelings and situation, it's best to distance yourself. You deserve someone who is willing to be open and honest with you."
3. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Girl, you're being played. He's not interested in you, he's just bored and looking for some attention. Don't waste your time on someone who's not willing to be honest with you. You deserve so much better than this."
4. **u/neutral_observer**: "It's possible that he's genuinely struggling with his relationship and is seeking comfort in your friendship. However, it's also possible that he's not ready to commit to either you or his girlfriend. You deserve to know where you stand, and it's okay to have a conversation with him about your feelings. Just be prepared for the possibility that he may not be ready to make a decision."
5. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. Let him know that you've noticed the signs of interest and that you're confused about his situation. Be prepared for him to break your heart, but also be prepared for the possibility that he may be willing to work through his issues and be honest with you about his feelings."

TITLE: Me [22F] and my boyfriend[29 F] of 1yr 9m, I don't see him as a lover anymore but I don't want to break his heart by leaving.

POST: My boyfriend is lovely and quirky but for a few months now I have found it hard to be physically attracted to him. He makes me laugh and we have interesting conversations, but I now think of him as a close friend. 

He has low self esteem when it comes to our relationship because I suspect his ex made him feel like he didn't deserve her. 

I couldn't tell you when I first felt the lack of attraction towards him or if there was some kind of moment that sparked this in me. He is the longest relationship I have had by just over a year. 

What makes it worse is we always blatantly talk about marriage and kids, so it's like we're already settled down. It's nice to be comfortable with someone as I've never really been good at making friends or even interact with the opposite sex.

My main fear is hurting him as I do love him, I just don't want to lie to him or to lead him on any further than I already have.

TL;DR: I've been with my boyfriend for 1yr 9m, but I've lost attraction towards him. I don't want to hurt him, but I don't want to lead him on either. I'm scared of hurting him and I don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're already in a state of emotional infidelity. You're not physically attracted to him, but you're still in the relationship and talking about marriage and kids. It's not fair to him to keep him in a relationship where you're not truly invested. You need to have a real conversation with him about your feelings and be honest with him. It's better to be honest and hurt him now than to lead him on and hurt him even more in the long run."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I understand your concerns, but have you tried to rekindle the spark? Sometimes relationships can get stale and a little effort can go a long way. Have you talked to him about your feelings and see if there's anything you can do together to reignite the passion?"
3. **relationship_ruth**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal for relationships to go through ups and downs, and it's okay if your feelings change over time. The fact that you still care about him and don't want to hurt him is a good sign. Maybe you can try to focus on the things you do still enjoy about him and see if that helps you reconnect on a deeper level. And if not, it's okay to have a conversation with him about your feelings and see where it takes you."
4. **honest_hank**: "I think you're being selfish. You're not happy in the relationship, but you're too scared to end it because you don't want to hurt him. Newsflash: relationships are about two people, not just one. If you're not happy, it's okay to end it and move on. You don't owe him anything, and you shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to be happy."
5. **empathetic_emily**: "I think you're being too focused on the physical aspect of your relationship. Just because you're not attracted to him physically doesn't mean you can't have a deep emotional connection with him. Have you tried to focus on the things you do enjoy about him, like his quirks and sense of humor? Maybe you can try to build a stronger emotional connection with him and see if that helps you feel more fulfilled in the relationship."

TITLE: Me [22F] with my co-worker [22M] - I made it awkward, any advice?

POST: Got a new job. Trained with co-worker, we're friends, he's cool. Hang out sometimes. Drink after work with other co-workers. Briefly think he likes me. No idea if he does. Don't really entertain the thought. 

Work there for 3 weeks, briefly see co-worker daily, always nice interactions.

Co-worker invites me over to hang and stay the night. That sounds like code to me, so I mentioned I thought he was cool and that I'm not keen on staying the night because seeing other guy. Never brought up this guy before. Pretty personal to be sharing at work, my dating escapades. Co-worker must not have figured it out or stalked me online enough.

Co-worker is sad. Short sentences, suggests we don't hang out. Feel like I did something wrong. Mention the convo is weird, we "reset" and he invites me over again. This time another friend of his is coming. I've met him, we all get along very well. So everything is fixed right?

TL;DR: Co-worker invites me over, I decline citing my dating life. He's sad, we "reset" and he invites me over again with another friend. I'm unsure if I did something wrong.

ADVICE NEEDED: Did I do something wrong? Should I apologize? Should I just let it go and move on? Help me out, Reddit!

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDIT**

* You didn't do anything wrong, OP. You were honest about your dating life and boundaries. Co-worker might have misinterpreted the invitation or was hoping for something more.
* Apologize if you feel like you did something wrong, but also make it clear that you were being honest about your intentions. You can say something like, "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the other night. I know you invited me over, and I appreciate that, but I wanted to be upfront about my dating life. I didn't mean to make things awkward."
* If co-worker is still upset, give him space. You can't control how others react, but you can control how you respond. If he's still interested in hanging out, suggest doing something low-key with the group of friends, like grabbing coffee or going for a walk.
* Remember that you're not obligated to explain or justify your dating life to anyone, especially not a coworker. You're entitled to your own boundaries and decisions.
* If you're still unsure about how to proceed, consider talking to a trusted friend or mentor for advice. They might be able to offer a fresh perspective or help you work through your feelings.

TITLE: Me (20sf) with smelly gym guys (20s? 30s? M) duration a couple of weeks.

POST: I'm (20s f) a pretty avid runner. My apartment building has a small gym that I run at every day, the same time eacy night on week nights. I can't run outside as I am 9/10 on call for work and must be within 15 minutes of my laptop at all times. 

A couple of weeks ago 2 guys (20s? 30s?) started coming to this small gym at/slightly before the time I go. Great for them! Except they smell like sweaty funky taint marinated in ball funk. It's horrendous. I've seen people gag coming into the gym. Their miasma of stench is so pervasive you can almost taste it. Like I don't see how if you shower, launder your gym clothes, and wear deodorant you could possibly exude such a god awful BO fog. I suspect they don't do any of these things. 

It's a small apartment gym. There's really no gym management to complain to. Would it be an asshole move to talk to them about this? I'm not generally good with people and I can't think of a non terrible way to tell these guys they fucking reek. I'm normally anti passive aggressive notes but would a note do it?

TL;DR: Smelly gym guys (20s? 30s?) at my apartment gym, making it unbearable for me. Should I talk to them about it or leave a note?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "Honestly, it's not your problem to fix. If they're not showering or wearing deodorant, that's on them. You can try talking to them, but it's not like it's going to change their behavior. Just wear a mask or run at a different time."
2. "I would try talking to them, but in a non-confrontational way. You could say something like, 'Hey guys, I'm really trying to focus on my workout and the smell is making it hard for me. Would you mind showering before coming to the gym?' It's possible they're not aware of how bad they smell."
3. "I'm a guy who used to be guilty of this. I would get so caught up in my workout that I'd forget to shower. But it's not an excuse. If you do decide to talk to them, try to approach it as a friendly conversation rather than an accusation. You could say something like, 'Hey, I'm trying to get in shape and I love running at this gym. But the smell is really bothering me. Can you help me out?'"
4. "I think a note would be a terrible idea. It's passive-aggressive and could come across as mean-spirited. If you do decide to talk to them, make sure you're respectful and empathetic. Remember, they're probably not trying to be smelly, they're just not taking care of themselves."
5. "I'm a runner too, and I can totally relate to this. I would try talking to them, but if that doesn't work, I would consider talking to the building management about the issue. It's not fair that you have to suffer through this every day."

TITLE: When does the guy stop paying for dinner?

POST: I [27/M] recently got into a huge fight with my--now ex-- girlfriend [24/F].

We'd been dating for about 2 years at this point and I still largely pay for all of our meals as well as our apartment + utilities. I have a nice luxury loft apartment and she keeps a very small--think glorified storage closet--apt in a bad neighborhood. She literally never goes there except to pick up and drop off clothing because I don't have enough closet space for two people. She doesn't pay a penny to live in my apartment or drive my car (we split the gas costs even though she drives it 80% of the time for her work and I walk to work.)

We both have good jobs. I make about twice what she does, but I have crushing student debt that I'm trying to pay off as fast as possible. I pay off about $3.5K of student debt a month, which really cuts into my cash flow, as you can imagine. She has about 1/10 the student debt I have.

I recently started suggesting that we split our food bills more evenly. I suggested that she could pay for her own meals and I'd pay for mine. Obviously we'd still go on dates and I'd pay for her meals, but on a day to day basis, I suggested that we split the food costs.

We ended up getting into a huge fight and then lots of old, old stuff came out and we ended up breaking up.

At this point, the relationship issue is moot, but she was my first really seriously, long-term relationship.

TL;DR: I've been paying for all of our meals and living expenses for 2 years. I suggested we split the food bills more evenly and she freaked out. We broke up. Now I'm wondering when the guy stops paying for dinner in a relationship.

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in relationships, where one partner feels like they are shouldering the majority of the financial burden. The OP (original poster) is wondering when it's appropriate for the guy to stop paying for dinner, implying that he feels like he's been carrying the load for too long.

The comments on this post are varied, with some people agreeing with the OP and others disagreeing. Some common themes that emerge include:

* The importance of communication in relationships: Many commenters suggest that the OP and his ex-girlfriend should have had a more open and honest conversation about their financial expectations and responsibilities.
* The need for a more equal division of expenses: Some commenters argue that it's unfair for the OP to be paying for all of their meals and living expenses, and that a more equal division of costs is necessary for a healthy relationship.
* The role of student debt in relationships: The OP's student debt is a significant factor in his financial situation, and some commenters suggest that this should be taken into account when discussing financial responsibilities in a relationship.

Overall, this post highlights the complexities and challenges of navigating financial responsibilities in a relationship, and the importance of communication and mutual understanding in resolving these issues.

TITLE: [16/m] How should I approach this girl? [16/f]

POST: Let's start with background information about this girl

There's this girl that I really like. We're in science class and I have free period with her. I also sometimes pass by her on the way to class everyday. In Science Class, we show little glances of each other. I'd usually look at her for a few seconds and when she looks back, I either smile or look away. Sometimes we see each other and we both smile -- but it could be that she's talking with her friends as well.

In Gym class, we notice each other but she's with her group of friends and I'm with my own group of friends. Kind of hard to get to know her. Today in gym, we actually lined up against a wall and I was next to her. I was nervous since we were both talking to our own little group of friends I guess.

We always make eye contact in some way and I feel like she might show some interest in me too. I really have a huge crush on her. What's also interesting is that prom is coming up in about a month and I really want to ask her to it -- but then again I don't know her very well. Any advice?

TL;DR: I have a crush on this girl in my science class. We make eye contact and sometimes smile at each other. I want to ask her to prom but I don't know her well. How should I approach her?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, it sounds like you're already making progress just by making eye contact and smiling at her. Don't overthink it too much. Just be yourself and see if you can strike up a convo with her in science class or gym. If she's interested, she'll show you signs. And if not, well, at least you tried."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "Hey there! It's great that you're thinking about asking her to prom, but maybe take a step back and focus on getting to know her better first. Ask her about her interests, hobbies, or favorite TV shows/movies. See if you have any common ground. And don't be afraid to be a little vulnerable and share your own interests with her. Good luck!"
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Ugh, prom is so overrated. Just ask her out on a normal date and see if you click. Don't make it all about the prom. And honestly, if she says no, it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I think you should be careful about asking her to prom without getting to know her better first. You don't want to put her on the spot or make her feel uncomfortable. Maybe try to have a casual conversation with her first and see if there's any mutual interest. And if not, don't be too hard on yourself. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."
5. **Lololol**: "Dude, just be yourself and don't overthink it. If she's interested, she'll show you signs. And if not, well, at least you tried. And honestly, prom is just a silly dance. It's not the end of the world if she says no. Just move on and find someone who's a better match for you."

TITLE: Stay put, or explore?

POST: So, Reddit, I have a query for you. I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year. I could stay there and be financially secure, and make enough to get by, and facilitate some lesser hobbies of mine, but I don't think i'd ever truly be happy working there, as my co-workers make it somewhat high-stress. 
   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post.

TL;DR: I'm 20, working at a stable but unfulfilling job in Michigan. A friend asked me to move to Aspen, Colorado with her. I have $6,000 saved up for the move. Should I take the leap and move to a new place with little to no job prospects, or stay in my current job for financial security?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I made a similar move 5 years ago, and it was the best decision I ever made. I was 22 at the time, and I had no job prospects in my field in my hometown. I took a leap of faith and moved to a new city, and it's been a wild ride ever since. I've had my ups and downs, but I've learned so much about myself and the world. If you're feeling restless and unfulfilled, I say go for it! You'll never know what could have been if you don't take the chance. Just make sure you have a plan in place for finding a job and getting settled."
2. **throwaway789**: "I'm a bit more cautious, but I think it's worth considering. You have a safety net with your savings, and you can always find a job in a new place. The worst that could happen is you don't find a job right away, but you can always find temporary work or freelance to get by. The best part is, you'll have the opportunity to start fresh and create a new life for yourself. Just make sure you're prepared for the challenges that come with moving to a new place, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it."
3. **throwaway345**: "I think you should stay where you are. You have a good job, and you're making a decent income. You also have a support system in place, which is important. Moving to a new place can be scary, and it's hard to know what to expect. You might end up regretting your decision and wishing you had stayed where you were. Plus, you have a good relationship with your employer and coworkers, which is valuable. Don't underestimate the importance of having a stable job and a support system."
4. **throwaway678**: "I think you should take the leap! You're young, and you have the opportunity to start fresh and create a new life for yourself. You'll never know what could have been if you don't take the chance. Plus, you have a safety net with your savings, so you're not taking on too much risk. Just make sure you're prepared for the challenges that come with moving to a new place, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You got this!"

TITLE: Revenge on a New Roommate

POST: I share an apartment with my boyfriend. There are two spare bedrooms which are a constant rotation of friends-in-need. We recently invited a friend to stay with us while she figures out what her next step in life is. 

Now, I want people to feel at home in my apartment, but she keeps moving things around so we can't find them, using things that aren't hers, and ruining our possessions. Her version of an apology is an explanation of her actions followed by, "So I'm sorry if I am guilty, but I don't think I am."

Last Sunday I got around to sorting through laundry she took it upon herself to wash. She ruined an expensive pair of fingerless mittens knit with alpaca yarn and she lost a prized shawl, gifted to me for being the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding this past summer. When I explained as much, and how I knew she was the guilty party, she insisted it wasn't possible she was at fault, and if she was, I shouldn't be upset with her for things she did weeks ago. 

You can understand, I'm pretty annoyed and generally disinterested in her disrespect. 

So I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed. I won't even wear any of it, but if she feels no remorse losing my shawl, I don't feel too guilty either.

TL;DR: New roommate is a nightmare, ruining my stuff and not apologizing properly. I'm taking petty revenge by keeping her clothes and not wearing them.

COMMENTS:

* "I'd do the same thing. You're not being petty, you're being reasonable. She's not respecting your belongings or your space, so why should you respect hers?"
* "I love this. You're taking back control of your own space and belongings. I hope she learns to respect you and your things soon."
* "I'd also take it a step further and start 'accidentally' moving her stuff around too. You know, just to show her how it feels"
* "I'm so with you on this. I had a roommate like that once and I ended up having to get a new one. It's not worth the stress and frustration. You're doing the right thing by setting boundaries and taking care of yourself."
* "I think you should take it a step further and have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. He might not be aware of the extent of the problem and might be able to help you find a solution. Good luck!"



This post showcases a common theme in the r/pettyrevenge community: taking small, passive-aggressive actions to assert one's power and control in a situation where one feels disrespected or taken advantage of. In this case, the OP is taking revenge on their new roommate by keeping her clothes and not wearing them, which is a small but symbolic act of defiance.

The comments on the post are overwhelmingly supportive, with many users agreeing that the OP is justified in taking this action and encouraging them to continue setting boundaries and taking care of themselves. Some users even suggest taking it a step further by "accidentally" moving the roommate's stuff around, which is a classic example of petty revenge.

The post also highlights the importance of communication and setting boundaries in relationships. The OP's boyfriend may not be aware of the extent of the problem, and having a conversation with him about how they're feeling could potentially lead to a solution. However, the OP is taking a more passive-aggressive approach, which may not be the most effective way to resolve the issue in the long run. Nonetheless, it's a relatable and entertaining example of petty revenge in action.

TITLE: Have I been friendzoned?

POST: Before I begin,  let me tell you that I am a girl to avoid any confusion later. Also,  this is the boy I consider(ed?) my best friend. 

So me and this boy have been friends for 6 years and we're really close. We are both seniors in high school. He asked me out in October and dumped before Christmas. He gave me reasons like "I don't want to be in a relationship that will have to end when we part for college", "I'm done with high school dating", "I need to focus on myself right now" and the infamous "I just don't want to ruin our friendship". As much as it sucked to hear,  I accepted it. He kept sending me messages about how much he wanted me but couldn't have me. Fast forward to yesterday when he tells me he's dating someone. An ex-girlfriend. What?We still hang out and talk like we did before we were dating.

TL;DR: I was friendzoned, he dumped me, and now he's dating an ex-girlfriend. I'm confused and hurt. Have I been friendzoned?

COMMENTS:

* "Girl, you were friendzoned. He never had any intention of being with you romantically. He just wanted to keep you as a backup plan or a friend with benefits. Don't waste your time on him anymore."
* "I think you're being too harsh. He did give you a reason for dumping you, even if it was a crappy one. Maybe he's just not ready for a relationship right now. And who knows, maybe he's genuinely happy with his new girlfriend."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a real kick in the gut. But honestly, you deserve so much better than someone who can't make up their mind about you. Keep your head up and focus on yourself. You'll find someone who truly cares about you."
* "I think you should talk to him about how you're feeling. Maybe he doesn't realize the hurt he's caused you. But also, maybe he's not the right person for you. You deserve someone who will treat you with respect and honesty."
* "Girl, you need to block his number and move on. He's clearly not interested in you romantically and is just using you as a crutch. You deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are."

This post highlights the common theme of friendzoning, where someone is led to believe that they are in a romantic relationship, only to be rejected or dumped without a clear explanation. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from those who believe the OP was friendzoned and deserves better, to those who think the OP is being too harsh and should give the guy another chance. The post also touches on the theme of self-worth and the importance of moving on from a toxic or unfulfilling relationship.

TITLE: My BF [29 M] who has a history of abortions, told me [25 F], his GF of 6 months, that he no longer wants to have sex due to his fear of getting me pregnant.

POST: This weekend my boyfriend confessed that the reason why we haven't had sex in a couple weeks is that 'when things start going well' he ruins it by getting the girl pregnant.

I am a very sexual person and if I had it my way, I'd have sex everyday, multiple times a day. So when he drops this bomb, I really don't know how to take it. I take the pill religiously, however we do not wear condoms. 

He has always been very upfront about his past --- including the abortions that he's had with multiple exes. However, when he told me that he doesn't want to have sex until we're married and ready to have kids, I was taken aback.

I want to be there for my BF and support him in anyway possible. Is there anything that can help him with the guilt and anxiety that he's feeling? Have you ever experienced this personally? Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you!

TL;DR: My 6-month-old boyfriend has a history of abortions and is now afraid of getting me pregnant, so he's stopped having sex with me. I'm confused and unsure how to handle this. Any advice or support would be appreciated.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions. He's had multiple abortions in the past and now he's trying to avoid getting you pregnant because he's scared of the responsibility. I would have a serious talk with him about why he's being so reckless with his actions and how it's affecting you. You deserve better than someone who is so scared of commitment."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that your boyfriend is being honest with you about his feelings. It's not easy to talk about something like this, especially when it's a sensitive topic. Maybe you can have a conversation with him about how you're feeling and see if there's a compromise that you can both agree on. For example, you could start using condoms or explore other forms of birth control that make you both feel more comfortable."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with the previous comment. It sounds like your boyfriend is genuinely struggling with his past and is trying to find a way to move forward. Maybe you can try to understand where he's coming from and see if there's a way to support him through this difficult time. It's not easy to overcome the guilt and anxiety that comes with having multiple abortions, and it's possible that he's just trying to find a way to make things right."
4. **u/anonymous_user**: "I've been in a similar situation before and it was really tough for me. I think it's great that your boyfriend is being honest with you, but it's also important to remember that you deserve to have a healthy and fulfilling sex life. Maybe you can try to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and see if there's a way to find a compromise that works for both of you. Remember that you're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think it's great that your boyfriend is being honest with you about his feelings, but it's also important to remember that you deserve to have a healthy and fulfilling sex life. Maybe you can try to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and see if there's a way to find a compromise that works for both of you. Remember that you're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time."

TITLE: Reddit. I'm a 29 year old girl from the UK whose long term relationship has just ended. Where the hell do I even start dating?

POST: I was in a relationship with the same guy for long time years. We were never suited. Made a massive mistake, we broke up. Lost all but two friends who are already in relationships and settled. That was three months ago.

I don't want to pick up guys in bars, I hate clubs. I work with older women that are settled with families, babies and belong to nappy clubs or whatever parents do.

Online dating seems good but also from old work friends experiences it can be tedious. I'm willing to give it a go despite this but have no idea what to look out for. I also don't know where to meet single people in real life.

Although both my exes have told me I'm pretty, I really don't think I am so there the whole self esteem thing. I'm friendly and flirty, but would wait for a sign someone liked me. So if I were sat in a bar I wouldn't just walk up to a strange guy and give him my number. Once I know someone I've got no problems with making moves. The thought of speed dating fills me with fear.

TL;DR: 29 year old girl from the UK, recently single, no idea where to start dating, don't want to pick up guys in bars, online dating seems good but unsure what to look out for, no idea where to meet single people in real life, self-esteem issues.

TITLE: Reddit, I've been friendzoned by the only girl I've ever considered to be marriage material. What do I do?

POST: So here's how it is: We met in high school. Became friends. Dated briefly in Year 12, but it didn't work out because we were young and I was kind of stupid. 

Since then we've always been close, despite living 3 hours away from each other. Over about 4 years, I have had spouts of falling in love with her again, only to give up after always being friendzoned.

Now I should be clear: in the past this girl has always been a bit insecure, and she dated plenty of boys to feel better about herself. After she woke up and realised how unhealthy that was, she made a decision to be single for at least a year. Now, she's happy with herself, because she took steps to change her life (yep. she's a keeper.)

So here's where I'm at now: we're both single, and we both enjoy that for now. But we're also really, REALLY close. I am crazy about her, but I have no idea whether I should give up and drift apart, or whether this could turn into a relationship in the future.

TL;DR: I've been friendzoned by the only girl I've ever considered to be marriage material. What do I do?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you're in a tough spot. But I think you should take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. You've been friendzoning yourself for years, and it's time to figure out what you want. Are you really ready to commit to this girl, or are you just holding onto the idea of being with her because it's comfortable?
2. **Redditor99**: I think you should have a heart-to-heart with her. Be honest about your feelings and see how she reacts. If she's not interested, then it's time to move on. But if she's open to the idea of a relationship, then you can start building something together.
3. **SarcasticSally**: Girl, you're 25 and still holding onto a high school crush? Get over yourself. You're better than that. Take some time to focus on yourself and find someone who actually wants to be with you.
4. **Anonymous Coward**: I think you should take a chance and tell her how you feel. The worst that can happen is she says no, and you're no worse off than you are now. But if she says yes, you could be starting something amazing.
5. **throwaway123456**: I think you should try to get to know her as a person, not just as the girl you've been in love with. See if you have common interests, values, and goals. If you do, then maybe there's a chance for a relationship. But if not, then it's time to move on.
6. **Redditor99**: I think you should take a break from each other for a bit. You've been friends for so long, and it's natural to feel like you're stuck in a rut. Take some time to focus on yourself and do things that make you happy. When you come back to the friendship, you might have a fresh perspective and be able to see each other in a new light.
7. **SarcasticSally**: Girl, you're not even sure if you're ready to commit to this girl, and you're still holding onto the idea of being with her? Get your priorities straight. You need to figure out what you want before you can even think about being with someone else.
8. **Anonymous Coward**: I think you should try to be more confident in yourself. If you're always second-guessing yourself and wondering if you're good enough, then you'll never be able to move forward. Take some time to work on your self-esteem and then see where things go with her.
9. **throwaway123456**: I think you should try to have a conversation with her about your feelings, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. It's okay to be disappointed, but don't give up on yourself. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you.
10. **Redditor99**: I think you should take a chance and see where things go. You've been friends for so long, and you know each other so well. If you don't take a chance, you'll always wonder what could have been. But if you do take a chance and it doesn't work out, then at least you'll know that you tried.

TITLE: Feeling a bit under appreciated. How do I hint to him?

POST: So my SO and I have exchanged Christmas gifts quite early this year. I was pretty damn excited about him opening the gifts I got him -- all wrapped and tied with a bow and shit. 
Well, he pressured me to open mine. He told me to close my eyes. And at this moment, I'm all excited and shit. Then, he puts my hands around it. I open my eyes and its a little bottle of Honey Jack. Now, I love alcohol as much as the next person, but my heart just fell. I had gotten him something.. more sentimental. 
I got him this awesome Indiana Jonesy leather covered flask and a nice bottle of Abercromie & Fitch's Fierce cologne.
Well he opened his gift tonight,  and to see his face light up made me feel so happy. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed and not as appreciated. I'm really not a naggy, whiny SO. But this feeling leaves me a little sad and unimportant.  
Btw, we've been kinda together for a littler over a year.
What should I do? Should I tell him straight up? If I do and he gets a gift, ill feel like it's only because I told him and that would just defeat the purpose.

TL;DR: SO got me a bottle of whiskey instead of the sentimental gifts I got him. Feeling underappreciated and unsure how to address it.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like he didn't put much thought into your gift. Maybe he's not as sentimental as you are. Instead of hinting, try having an open and honest conversation with him about how you feel. Let him know that you appreciate the effort, but the whiskey didn't really speak to you. You can say something like, 'Hey, I loved the thought behind the gifts, but I was really hoping for something more sentimental. Can we talk about what you were thinking when you got me the whiskey?'"
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "It's not about the gift itself, it's about the thought and effort behind it. If you feel like he didn't put much thought into it, it's okay to express that. But don't make it about the gift, make it about how you feel. You can say, 'Hey, I feel like we're at a point in our relationship where I want to feel more appreciated and seen. Can we work on that together?'"
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you gotta stop overthinking this. It's just a gift. If he didn't get you what you wanted, that's okay. You can always get him something else. And honestly, whiskey is a pretty great gift. Maybe he's just not as sentimental as you are. Don't make a big deal out of it and just move on."
4. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: "I think you should have a conversation with him about how you feel. But don't be accusatory or make him feel bad. Just express your feelings and see how he responds. If he's not willing to listen or understand, then that's a red flag. But if he's willing to work on it, then that's a good sign. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."

**Original poster's response:** "Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll take a more open and honest approach with him. I'll try to express my feelings without making him feel bad or guilty. And who knows, maybe he'll surprise me with something more sentimental next time. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: My wife of three months threatened to move out.

POST: Backstory: Been with her for about 4 years, things were great.  3 months ago we get married. We both work a lot, opposite schedules, and rarely see each other.  We bought a farm together, and have been settling in there too. Gradually she has withdrawn to the point of frigidity, and basic intimacy, holding hands, kissing, smiling. She comes home exhausted and sits there, at times I have to wrestle basic sentences out of her.  She says it's stress from work, and not to worry. I started picking up her end of basic work around the house and farm to help her out with stress. Still though whenever I try to do anything special, or social with her she always resists it, with rules, stipulations, or being negative, and an overall close-minded downer. Not her personality at all, but there it is time and time again. Conversely, she also will go and hang out with her friends over night regularly with carefree ease.  

Yesterday, as I serve her breakfast she says that, she doesn't take care of me.

Whenever we have time off she flees from my presence. Today, Thanksgiving was no different.  She talks about driving over an hour away to her friends McMansion for a Walmart thanksgiving. I reminded her of years past when we have done that and she ended up being exhausted at the end of the day, she just got off a 15 hour shift. She also never framed it within the context of me coming along, and left me saying she was only going to be there a few hours. 

Even though she works at a grocery store and finds it impossible to bring food home. I went and got ingredients for at least a home cooked meal tonight.  Well I fell asleep, waiting for her. Got a text at one in morning saying that she was going midnight shopping.  So I finally called her out for being inconsiderate, and wish her a happy thanksgiving. 

She now wants to come get her dog and leave. Then goes on (via text) about how she constantly fails and pretends to be happy around me for months, and she should just grab her dog, who is attached at the hip to my dog, and leave.  

WTF?

TL;DR: Wife of 3 months threatens to leave after I call her out for being inconsiderate on Thanksgiving. She says she's been pretending to be happy for months and wants to leave.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, it sounds like your wife is struggling with depression or anxiety. The fact that she's been withdrawing from intimacy and social activities, and is now saying she's been pretending to be happy for months, suggests that she's been feeling overwhelmed and unhappy. It's not uncommon for people to feel this way, especially during stressful times like the holidays. Have you considered talking to her about how you can support her and help her feel more comfortable and happy in your relationship?"
2. **relationshipguru**: "OP, it sounds like you're feeling frustrated and hurt by your wife's behavior. It's understandable that you're upset, but it's important to try to understand where she's coming from. It's possible that she's feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and that's causing her to pull away from you. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her behavior is having on you, and that a conversation could help clear the air and improve your relationship."
3. **concernedcitizen**: "OP, I'm concerned about the tone and language you're using in your post. You're calling your wife inconsiderate and saying she's pretending to be happy, which is a pretty harsh accusation. Have you considered taking a step back and trying to understand where she's coming from? It's possible that she's feeling stressed and overwhelmed, and that's causing her to behave in ways that are hurtful to you. Instead of attacking her, have you tried having a calm and respectful conversation with her about how you're feeling?"
4. **experiencedOP**: "OP, I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for people to pull away from their partners during stressful times. The key is to try to understand where your wife is coming from and to communicate openly and honestly with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and that's causing her to behave in ways that are hurtful to you. Instead of attacking her, try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her about how you're feeling. And remember, relationships are about compromise and understanding, so try to find ways to work together and support each other through tough times."
5. **newbieOP**: "OP, I'm new to this subreddit, but I wanted to offer some advice. It sounds like your wife is struggling with some deep-seated issues, and it's not just about being inconsiderate or pretending to be happy. Have you considered seeking couples therapy or counseling to help you both work through these issues? A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your problems in a healthy and constructive way."

TITLE: I [17M] was with my new girlfriend [17F] and I couldn't perform when it counted.

POST: So I haven't had the best luck with the ladies in my life, but I finally got a girlfriend and I'm crazy about her already. She's hot, smart, funny, everything I wanted in a girl. 

So we're at my place and things get hot and heavy and we begin kissing and taking off clothes. First off, the furthest I've gotten with a girl before this was a blowjob when I was drunk at a party. Anyway, clothes are off and I'm hard as a rock waiting to go.

I go down on her and I'm still rock hard and she climaxes and she's ready to return the favor to me. When she goes to blow me I start to go soft for some reason. I;m trying to concentrate on her and the generous, hot action she's doing but I just can't focus. I'm so confused and to compensate for that I go down on her again and the erection returns.

She says she wants me to fuck when I'm done going down on her and I get up to fuck her and I lose the hard on again. After that she was accepting and said we could wait (I'm still a virgin) for the next time we get together. I'm not sure why I kept losing the hard on when it mattered. If it changes anything I always over think things and I'm in my own head a lot. 

I talked to my best friend about and he said that I was probably nervous, but I'm completely ready to lose my virginity.

TL;DR: I'm 17, got a new girlfriend, we got intimate but I couldn't perform when it counted. I'm confused and worried about it.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 17 and a virgin. It's normal to be nervous. Don't worry about it, just relax and enjoy the experience. You'll get better with time."
* "I think your friend is right, you were probably nervous. It's okay to be nervous, but try to focus on the moment and not overthink things. You'll get the hang of it."
* "I'm a girl and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for guys to get nervous or lose their hard on during sex. It's not a big deal, just talk to your girlfriend about it and see how she feels. Maybe she can help you relax and get in the mood again."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're 17, you're a virgin, and you're trying to perform. Just relax and enjoy the experience. You don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes."
* "I'm a guy and I went through the same thing when I was your age. It's normal to feel nervous and unsure of yourself. Just remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that your girlfriend is probably more focused on the experience than on your performance. Try to relax and enjoy it, and don't worry too much about it."

**Top-level comments:**

* "I think the most important thing is to communicate with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're nervous and that you're not sure what's going on. She might be able to help you relax and get in the mood again."
* "I agree with the previous comment. Communication is key. Also, try to focus on the moment and not overthink things. You're 17, you're a virgin, and you're trying to have sex for the first time. It's okay to make mistakes and it's okay to not be perfect."

TITLE: Me [18 M] dating a [19 F] off and on for a year. Experiencing intense sadness and anxiety when away.

POST: I've been dating a girl off and on for about one year now.  Things have been complicated for a variety of reasons but it's finally stable and we've been going at it for about a month.  

I feel crazy for feeling this way and I acknowledge that, but I can't help it.  When we're hanging out it's fantastic, really fantastic for both of us.  Through everything we still have a stupid amount of fun together.  

The problem is that whenever I'm not hanging out with her, I become really sad and anxious thinking about the two of us and I can't stop it.  I assume it's a personal issue but I don't know how to fix it.

TL;DR: Dating a girl off and on for a year, things are stable now but I experience intense sadness and anxiety when we're apart.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I think it's normal to feel this way. It sounds like you're experiencing separation anxiety. It's not uncommon, especially if you've been through a lot of ups and downs with this girl. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? It might help her understand you better and maybe even help you work through it together.

COMMENT 2:
I totally get it, OP. I've been in similar situations before. For me, it was always about the uncertainty of the relationship. When we're together, everything feels great, but when we're apart, I start to worry about whether we'll ever be together again. It's like my mind is constantly thinking about the worst-case scenario. Have you tried talking to her about your fears and worries? It might help her understand where you're coming from and maybe even help you work through some of those feelings together.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel sad and anxious when you're apart from someone you care about. It doesn't mean you're crazy or that there's anything wrong with you. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you happy when you're together. And hey, maybe try to schedule regular check-ins or dates when you're apart to help alleviate some of that anxiety.

COMMENT 4:
OP, I think you should take a step back and evaluate whether this relationship is really healthy for you. If you're constantly feeling anxious and sad when you're apart, that's not a good sign. Maybe you're putting too much emotional energy into this relationship and it's not reciprocated. Have you considered talking to a therapist about your feelings? They might be able to help you work through some of this stuff and figure out what's going on.

COMMENT 5:
OP, I think you're being way too focused on the negative aspects of your relationship. Yeah, it's normal to feel sad and anxious when you're apart, but maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you happy when you're together. And hey, maybe try to schedule regular check-ins or dates when you're apart to help alleviate some of that anxiety. And hey, maybe try to focus on the present moment and not worry so much about the future or the past. Just my two cents. 

The comments on this post offer a range of perspectives and advice. Some commenters suggest that the OP's feelings are normal and that talking to his girlfriend about his anxiety might help alleviate it. Others suggest that the OP should focus on the positive aspects of his relationship and try to schedule regular check-ins or dates when they're apart. A few commenters are more critical, suggesting that the OP's feelings might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship or that he's putting too much emotional energy into the relationship.

The title of the post is also effective in conveying the OP's feelings and concerns. It's short and to the point, and it immediately conveys the main issue that the OP is struggling with.

TITLE: Let me [20m] tell you a story and afterwards ask you this: is Paula [18f] being a bitch?

POST: Let's say there's a guy called John [21m]. John kinda likes Paula and he wants her to think of him as a nice guy, get a good rep with her and such. John mentions Game of Thrones to her, and she says she's really into it, and also that she even read a few books before the show started airing.

John gets excited, because them both like the same thing a lot! Then he offers to lend her the dvd box of the second season, to be a nice guy and maybe win her heart little by little. She accepts!

Paula then proceeds to carry out the dvd box to another guy's house, watching the series with him as well as making out, on John's expenses. Is Paula a bitch?

TL;DR: John lends Paula a Game of Thrones dvd box, she watches it with another guy, makes out with him, and John's left feeling used.

---

**Comments:**

* "Yeah, Paula's being a bit of a bitch. She took advantage of John's kindness and used him to get the dvds. Not cool." (123 upvotes)
* "I don't think it's that black and white. Paula might have just been really into the show and didn't think twice about watching it with someone else. Maybe John should've asked her if she was interested in watching it with him first?" (56 upvotes)
* "Paula's a total bitch. She knew John was into her and she used him to get the dvds. Then she went and watched it with someone else? That's just rude." (34 upvotes)
* "I think John's the one who's being a bit of a doormat here. He's trying to impress Paula by being nice, but she's not even reciprocating. Maybe he should take a step back and re-evaluate his feelings for her." (21 upvotes)
* "Paula's not a bitch, she's just a normal person who likes the show. John's the one who's being possessive and controlling. He should've just asked her if she wanted to watch it with him instead of lending it to her without asking." (15 upvotes)

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community is divided on whether Paula is being a "bitch" or not. Some users believe she took advantage of John's kindness and used him to get the dvds, while others think she might have just been really into the show and didn't think twice about watching it with someone else. The comments also highlight the importance of communication and boundaries in relationships, with some users suggesting that John should've asked Paula if she was interested in watching the show with him first. Ultimately, the post sparks a lively discussion about the complexities of relationships and the importance of considering multiple perspectives.

TITLE: Thoughts on a prenup

POST: I proposed last weekend. We've talked about it for a long time, I just finally got around to doing it. 

Now to the important stuff. We've been together for over 5 years, lived together for four. She's extremely responsible with her money, which is one of the reasons I haven't really thought I needed one. She pays me a set amount a month for rent, we just kind of split other things like groceries and such. I'd say I generally pay for going out to eat, vacations, etc. But I make a lot more than she does, so I don't have a problem with that. Even though we have separate accounts, I'd say we both consider things ours. I do own a house, but like I said, she's paying a little over a 3rd of that payment a month.

I don't want to sound like I have love blinders on, I'm a pessimist generally, but I can't really see the need for one. If something ever did happen where we got divorced, which I really can't see but I know people change, should I still get one? Honestly if that happened, I know myself, and I'd be civil and fair about who get's what, I could guarantee that. I really couldn't see her being any other way either, we're a lot a like that way.

We're not going to have kids, and if we did split, I'd feel she was owed at minimum, all of the money she paid towards the house, if not half of the house itself. 

So, should I still look into getting one? Feel free to be as critical as possible about my views on things. She already asked me if I wanted one, as I technically have more assets than her (even though I consider them ours), so getting one wouldn't be an issue. I feel the fact that she asked that speaks to her financial responsibility.

TL;DR: Proposed to my girlfriend, we've been together 5+ years, lived together 4. We have separate accounts, but consider things ours. I make more than her, but she pays a significant amount of rent. I own a house, but she pays a third of the payment. I'm considering a prenup, but don't see the need. Should I still get one?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're being a bit naive. Even if you and your girlfriend are on the same page now, things can change. A prenup can protect your assets and ensure that you're not stuck with a bunch of debt if things don't work out. It's not about being pessimistic, it's about being prepared."
* "I agree with the previous comment. A prenup can be a good idea even if you don't think you need it. It's a way to have a conversation about your finances and make sure you're on the same page. It's not about being suspicious or distrustful, it's about being responsible."
* "I think you're being a bit too relaxed about this. You're not just talking about a prenup, you're talking about your entire financial future. You need to think about what you want to happen in the event of a divorce, and make sure you're protected. A prenup can help you achieve that."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the financial aspect. A prenup is not just about dividing up your assets, it's about what kind of relationship you want to have. Do you want to have a relationship where you're both on the same page, or do you want to have a relationship where you're both trying to outmaneuver each other? A prenup can help you clarify that."
* "I think you should get a prenup. It's not about being pessimistic, it's about being prepared. You never know what the future holds, and a prenup can give you peace of mind. Plus, it's a way to have a conversation about your finances and make sure you're on the same page."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the idea of a prenup as a way to protect yourself. A prenup can be a way to protect both of you. It can help you have a conversation about your finances and make sure you're both on the same page. It's not just about what you want to happen in the event of a divorce, it's about what kind of relationship you want to have."

TITLE: I [18 M] have a crush on my [18 F]friend, not sure if she has a crush on me too.

POST: So, I have a crush on this girl since I met her in our freshman year of highschool. I think she has had a crush on me too, but I'm not sure.

 
She once put her phone on my cellphone without me asking for it. She gave me a nickname which none of my other friends use, and I love when she calls me by that nickname (I also have a nickname for her, that only I use). She would also sit beside me in all classes. She liked to hold hands with me "because of the cold", but then, no matter how the weather was, I would just grab her hand, or she would grab mine, just for the sake of holding hands. A friend of mine (female) always said that it was weird. 

The problem is, she's living in another city now. She is visiting her mom in my city, and I asked her out last Sunday, and I was planning to tell her about my feelings. But I didn't. We had a great time, talked for a couple of hours that felt like a couple of minutes, but in the end I couldn't say anything. 

She's leaving this Saturday, and I said I wanted to see her again because I had something to tell her. I think she already knows what it is about (after this text, anyway).

What do you guys think? Is it possible that she has a crush on me?

TL;DR: I have a crush on my friend, but I'm not sure if she has a crush on me too. We've had some close moments, but I didn't tell her about my feelings when I had the chance. Now I'm worried that I might have missed my chance.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, it's clear she has a crush on you! The signs are all there. You should've told her when you had the chance, but it's not too late now. Just be honest and genuine, and I'm sure she'll feel the same way."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She might just be a friendly person who likes to hold hands and sit close to people. Don't assume she has a crush on you just because of a few coincidences."
* "I think you should've told her when you had the chance, but it's not the end of the world if you didn't. Just be honest with her now and see how she reacts. If she doesn't feel the same way, at least you'll know and can move on."
* "I think you're being too subtle. If you want to know if she has a crush on you, you should've asked her directly. Don't leave things up to interpretation."
* "I think you should take things slow and get to know her better before making any big declarations. You don't know if she's the right person for you, and you don't want to rush into anything."

This post is a great example of how people can misinterpret or overthink the signs of someone's feelings. The OP is unsure if his friend has a crush on him, and is seeking advice from the community. The comments range from people who think it's clear she has a crush on him, to those who think he's overthinking it and should just be honest with her. This post highlights the importance of communication and not assuming someone's feelings without asking them directly. It also shows how people can have different perspectives and opinions on the same situation.

TITLE: Foot swollen after Salicylic acid wart treatment

POST: Hi there,

Basically, I have had a plantars wart on my right big toe for almost two years and the past couple weeks I have been fighting it pretty relentlessly. I have been doing freeze treatments, applying salicylic acid, and removing layers of dead skin.

The last time I removed skin was on Monday night. I got deep enough that I felt I was almost at the base of the wart. In an attempt to get closer to the bottom, I picked at the wart with my pocket knife (consistently disinfected the knife and my foot with lots of rubbing alcohol and wore gloves). I got deep but only deep enough to draw a tiny amount of blood. I then started reapplying my Salicylic acid treatment to the area from that night until this (Wednesday) morning.

Today, my toe was very sore all day at work, and stung fairly sharply on the spot of my wart. I figured it might be from the salicylic acid, so when I got home from work, I soaked my toe in apple cider vinegar in an attempt to remove the dried acid. However, this didn't get rid of all of it. Also, at this point, I realized my toe and was getting fairly warm and swollen, and that the rest of my foot was getting a bit warm as well. After this, I took some isopropyl alcohol and a knife, and gently rubbed/peeled away all the visible dried acid left on my toe. However, my toe doesn't feel any better. I am currently laying with it raised and covered in neosporin.

Long story short, should I be concerned about some sort of infection or anything? Or could this just be a normal response to my treatment? I have no known allergies, other serious medical conditions, or anything like that. I am a 20 year old white male and am (hopefully) healthy.

Thank you!

TL;DR: I treated my plantars wart with salicylic acid and removed layers of dead skin. I then picked at the wart with a pocket knife and re-applied acid. My toe is now swollen, sore, and warm. Should I be concerned about infection?

**Responses:**

* "I think you should be concerned about infection. You picked at the wart with a knife, which can introduce bacteria into the wound. The swelling, soreness, and warmth are all signs of infection. I would recommend seeing a doctor to get it checked out and possibly get a prescription antibiotic cream or ointment."
* "I agree with the previous poster. You should definitely see a doctor about this. The fact that you picked at the wart with a knife and then applied salicylic acid could have caused an infection. The swelling and warmth are not normal responses to wart treatment. Get it checked out ASAP."
* "I'm not a doctor, but I think you should be concerned about infection. The fact that you picked at the wart with a knife and then applied salicylic acid could have caused an infection.

TITLE: Me[23F] was dumped 4 months ago. Need some advice about getting back into dating

POST: My boyfriend left me four months ago. We had been together almost three years. I really felt that the breakup was devastating. It took me a bit of time to get to where I am now. I realized that our relationship was unhealthy and my SO treated me poorly. I finally feel like my self again and I am happy in my life.

I'd really like to go out and meet new people. I'm not really sure where to start. I'm worried it is going to feel strange. I'm worried about being awkward. I was completely committed to one person for almost 3 years. It seems it will be hard to open up. I'd love any advice on how to get back out there.

TL;DR: I was dumped 4 months ago and I'm ready to start dating again. I'm worried about being awkward and opening up to new people. Any advice would be great.

COMMENTS:

* "Hey OP, congrats on realizing the unhealthy dynamic in your previous relationship and taking steps to prioritize your own happiness! It's completely normal to feel nervous about dating again, but remember that you're not the same person you were 4 months ago. You've grown and learned from your experiences. Take things at your own pace, and don't be too hard on yourself if it takes time to get back into the swing of things. Consider online dating or trying out new social activities to meet new people. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and focus on yourself for a bit before jumping into a new relationship."
* "OP, I totally get it. It's scary to put yourself out there again, especially after a long-term relationship. But you're doing great by acknowledging your feelings and taking steps to move forward. Remember that everyone is awkward at some point or another, and it's okay to make mistakes. Just be yourself, be kind, and don't be afraid to say no if something doesn't feel right. And hey, you might be surprised by how quickly you start to feel comfortable and confident again!"
* "Hey OP, I'm glad you're feeling happy and fulfilled again! It's amazing how much growth and self-awareness can come from a tough breakup. As for dating, I think it's great that you're taking things slow and focusing on yourself. Remember that it's okay to take your time and not rush into anything. You're not looking for a replacement for your ex, you're looking for someone who is a good match for YOU. Take your time, be patient, and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. And hey, don't be afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone – it's a great way to meet new people and have fun!"

TITLE: Me [25 M] was dumped by my [23 F] on my birthday and now she is in a relationship with my friend.

POST: She broke up with me on my birthday 7 months ago, ending a 7 month relationship, because I didn't contribute to the rent, I stayed at her apartment and went to my college classes. She said 3 days earlier that she would breakup with me if I didn't find a job in 2 weeks, she broke her word. She said that I wasn't mature enough for a relationship. She told me not to get stuck on her and that I would find another girl. 

Then as of recently we stopped being friends with benefits because she has a new squeeze: my friend who I introduced her to. He told her to ignore me and she complied and now I am being treated like the bubonic plague. She threatened to throw out some of my clothes if I didn't give her marijuana and ever since(a full month later) she is still ignoring me.

I would really like to get her back, but I understand that might not be an option. I am struggling for the first time in my life to be independent and will soon move to a state where I can start the business I want to but it will take some time before I am successful enough to support her and give her what she gave to me. 

Personally it hurts but it seems like the best option is to move on, still I am having a hard time getting over her and I feel like she is telling me to fuck off. I think we both made mistakes but I think that her actions are unacceptable.

How should I deal with this and how do I have healthier relationships in the future? And how do I deal with this heartbreak?

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend broke up with me on my birthday, now she's in a relationship with my friend, and is ignoring me. I'm struggling to move on and feel like she's telling me to fuck off. How do I deal with this and have healthier relationships in the future?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to focus on yourself and your own growth. You can't change the past, and it's clear she's moved on. You deserve someone who loves and respects you for who you are, not someone who uses you for a temporary fix. Take this as an opportunity to work on yourself and find someone who truly cares about you."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's clear she's a toxic person who doesn't respect boundaries or appreciate what you bring to the table. You deserve so much better. Take some time to focus on yourself, and when you're ready, you'll find someone who loves and respects you for who you are."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. Instead of dwelling on what she did, focus on what you can do to improve yourself and move forward. You're not defined by this relationship or her actions."
* "Honestly, it sounds like she was never really invested in you or your relationship. She was using you for her own convenience, and now that you're not meeting her expectations, she's moved on. You deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you and your well-being. Take this as a chance to learn and grow, and don't waste your time on someone who doesn't appreciate you."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate what you want in a relationship. It sounds like you're still holding onto the hope of getting her back, but it's clear she's moved on. You deserve someone who loves and respects you, not someone who is using you for their own gain. Take some time to focus on yourself and what you want in a relationship, and then you can start moving forward."

TITLE: Help a middle-aged new college graduate improve my situation

POST: I'm not actually graduating until next spring, but I thought that this would be a good time to ask, so I have plenty of time to get things in order or to possibly pursue some of the things that are advised.

Here's the story: I'm 35 years old, a Marine Corps veteran and a married father of 3. At this time, my wife doesn't earn much at all and we're barely making it on my blue-collar income of around 43-48k/year (depends on overtime availability).

I hate my job, and I'm finally finishing up my degree so that I can move into something else. Unfortunately, I've heard too many horror stories about recent grads being offered $13-15/hour and taking it because it's actually pretty good, relative to other offers or opportunities.

I'm terrified that despite my education, I won't be able to move into anything that pays more than I'm currently making "right out of the gate", so to speak.

I'm not afraid to move if I have to, and I can learn pretty much anything I need to. My BA will be in "Integrative Leadership Studies", which is just a generic Adult Degree program at my college.

I'm not afraid to continue on to a graduate program, but I'd like to leave my current job first, if at all possible.

Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, married father of 3, finishing up BA in Integrative Leadership Studies. Worried about being stuck in a low-paying job despite education. Seeking advice on how to improve my situation.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* **Get a side hustle**: Consider taking on a part-time job or freelancing to increase your income and gain more experience.
* **Network**: Attend job fairs, networking events, and connect with people in your industry on LinkedIn to build relationships and learn about job opportunities.
* **Highlight transferable skills**: Emphasize the skills you've developed as a Marine Corps veteran, such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving, which can be valuable in many industries.
* **Consider internships**: Look into internships or volunteer work to gain experience and build your resume.
* **Don't be afraid to start at the bottom**: You may not land your dream job right away, but starting at a lower level can be a great way to learn and work your way up.
* **Keep an open mind**: Be willing to consider different industries, roles, and locations to find the best fit for you.
* **Update your resume and online profiles**: Make sure your resume, LinkedIn profile, and other online presence are up-to-date and highlight your education and skills.

* **Don't give up**: It may take some time to find the right job, but don't get discouraged and keep working towards your goals.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* **Take care of yourself**: With a family and a stressful job, it's easy to neglect your own well-being. Make sure to prioritize self-care and take time for yourself.
* **Set realistic expectations**: Don't expect to land a high-paying job right away. Be prepared to start at a lower level and work your way up.
* **Be flexible**: Be open to different types of jobs, industries, and locations. You never know what opportunities may arise.
* **Keep learning**: Continuously develop your skills and knowledge to stay competitive in the job market.
* **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, and mentors about your concerns and goals. They may be able to offer valuable advice and support.

**CONCLUSION:**

The subreddit community offers a range of advice and tips to help the OP improve his situation. From getting a side hustle to practicing his elevator pitch, the advice is practical and actionable. The community also emphasizes the importance of taking care of oneself, setting realistic expectations, and being flexible.

TITLE: Me [38 M] with my Fiancee [27 F] of one and a half years, I found out she cannot leave me because of financial reasons

POST: About 8 months ago we had a very bad fight. She had caught me in a lie (nothing about cheating, but it was something I lied about my past that was important to her). She was on the verge of breaking up with me. All of a sudden, we were fine about a few weeks later, and we rarely fought about that reason. 

Now, I just came to realize after a breakdown she had, that she may actually want to break up with me but she can't because she relies upon me greatly (much greater than I thought) for financial reasons. Basically she'd be out on the street and so would her mom (she sends her money from her part time job). If it were only her she said she could be "free" in her own words (but I think she might have been implying that she *would* be free if she had the chance.

I'm not 100% sure what she was saying, that she *would* definitely not be with me now if it weren't for financial support, or that she is just upset because she doesn't at least have that choice. 

I can't figure it out, and I am devistated obviously! She just went to sleep and I don't even know what to do. 

I don't want to force someone to be with me while they don't want this, love isn't a one way street. Even if she tries to "make the best of it" to be with me, I only want someone with me who's in it 100%, especially since we plan on getting married. 

What to do? If I leave her because she's not 100% (or so I think) I would feel guilty, on top of that, her and her mom on the street (or at the very best couch surfing with relatives).

TL;DR: Fiancee of 1.5 years can't leave me because of financial reasons, but I'm not sure if she wants to be with me or just stuck with me. I'm torn between leaving her and feeling guilty or staying and potentially being with someone who doesn't truly want to be with me.

**Comments:**

* "You're right to be torn. This is a tough spot. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Maybe have an open and honest conversation about what you're both thinking and feeling?"
* "I think you're being too focused on the financial aspect. It's not just about the money. It's about the emotional support and stability she gets from being with you. You need to consider what she's getting out of this relationship beyond just the financial benefits."
* "You can't force someone to stay in a relationship they don't want to be in. If she's only staying because of financial reasons, that's not a healthy relationship. You deserve better than that."
* "Have you considered counseling? A professional can help you both work through your feelings and come to a decision that's best for both of you."
* "I think you're being too harsh on yourself. You're not forcing her to stay, you're just being honest about your feelings. If she's not willing to work through this with you, then maybe she's not the right person for you."
* "This is a tough one. I think you need to take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to accept. You can't keep going on like this, wondering if she's really happy with you or just stuck with you."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just have a conversation with her and be honest about how you're feeling. If she's not willing to work through this with you, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is torn between leaving his fiancée because he feels she's not 100% committed to the relationship, and staying because he feels guilty about leaving her and her mom in a difficult financial situation.
* The comments suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with his fiancée about his feelings and concerns, and consider counseling to work through their issues.
* Some commenters suggest that the OP should prioritize his own emotional well-being and not force someone to stay in a relationship they don't want to be in.
* Others suggest that the OP should consider the emotional support and stability his fiancée gets from being with him, and whether she's getting more out of the relationship than just financial benefits.

TITLE: How can my [25/m] boyfriend and I[23/f] split the holidays?

POST: I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last 2 years, when Thanksgiving and Christmas came along, we spent it with our own families. His family lives 5 hours away from my family, so it's not very realistic to spend one day with one family, and then go to the other one's the next day. I would really love to spend a holiday with my boyfriend, but I feel bad for my parents. His family makes a much bigger deal out of holidays than mine, and he likes his family a lot more than I like my family so I can't convince him to come spend the holiday with my family. Thanksgiving is tomorrow and I could still go with him to his parent's house over mine, but I hardly ever see my parents. My parents are currently spending a lot of money on me to put me through school, so I feel like it's really selfish of me to ditch my parents to spend Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family.

So I guess the main question is: Should I go ahead and finally spend a holiday with my boyfriend of 3 years, or should I spend it with my parents since they've been such good parents and I feel bad?

And for another question... How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future so that everyone is happy?

TL;DR: I'm torn between spending Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family or my own family. His family makes a big deal out of holidays, and I feel bad for my parents who are spending a lot of money on me to put me through school. How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future so that everyone is happy?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not selfish to want to spend the holiday with your boyfriend. You've been together for 3 years, and it's not like you're abandoning your parents forever. You can always make it up to them another time. Maybe you can compromise and spend a day with your parents and then join your boyfriend's family for dinner or something?"
2. **RelationshipGoals**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. It's okay to prioritize your relationship and spend the holiday with your boyfriend. You can always talk to your parents about it and explain how you feel. They might understand that you want to spend time with your partner. And who knows, maybe they'll even want to spend the holiday with your boyfriend too!"
3. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: "I think you're being too focused on what others might think. You need to think about what you want and what makes you happy. If you want to spend the holiday with your boyfriend, then do it. You can always make it up to your parents another time. And if your boyfriend is worth it, he'll understand and respect your decision."
4. **PracticalAdvice**: "Why don't you talk to your boyfriend about this and see what he thinks? Maybe he has some ideas for how you can split the holidays in the future. And if you're really worried about your parents, you could always compromise and spend a day with them and then join your boyfriend's family for dinner or something. It's not about abandoning your parents, it's about finding a way to make everyone happy."
5. **Empathy**: "I can totally understand why you're feeling torn. It's hard to choose between your family and your partner. But remember that your parents will always be there for you, and you can always make it up to them another time. Your boyfriend is also important, and you deserve to spend time with him too. Maybe you can find a way to make it work and spend some time with both your family and your boyfriend. Good luck!"

TITLE: I hate a majority of the females in my age group.

POST: 23 year old male here. I don't know what else to say about this other than I hate the personalities of the 21 to 28 year old female population. A majority of them are completely superficial and have no drive beyond being the pretty girl or the object of physical desire. Having a conversation with them is like pulling teeth and hardly consists of any real or meaningful topics. Drinking, social media, and 'pretty' things. Basically the only three things that matter to women in this age bracket.

I know I know... This is not true for everyone/fuck stereotyping/everyone is an individual bullshit. But seriously, take a look at your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account. You'll find a majority of this to be true. And of course you'll find the great ones who are just awesome people, but I feel like they are rare and very much exceptions to the rule. 

I compare them to the women I work with, who are around 30+ years of age, and the personal experiences I have had with them. A higher percentage of these women are incredibly funny with a deeper sense of humor, enjoy a broad range of topics in conversation, and treat people with much more respect. 

I guess the

TL;DR: I'm a 23 year old male who thinks most women in my age group are superficial and only care about physical appearance. I think the older women I work with are more down-to-earth and respectful. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one who thinks this way.

This post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users expressing both agreement and disagreement with the OP's views. Some common themes that have emerged in the comments include:

* Many users have shared their own negative experiences with women in their age group, citing superficiality, lack of interest in meaningful conversations, and a focus on physical appearance.
* Others have argued that the OP's views are stereotypical and unfair, pointing out that not all women in their age group fit this description.
* Some users have suggested that the OP's frustration may be due to his own insecurities or lack of confidence, and that he should focus on building meaningful relationships with women rather than generalizing about an entire age group.
* A few users have shared their own positive experiences with women in their age group, citing strong, intelligent, and independent women who are not superficial or focused solely on physical appearance.

Overall, the discussion has been lively and contentious, with many users passionately expressing their opinions on the topic.

TITLE: Filming inside an airport, is it illegal?

POST: Ok, heres the story:

I was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us "We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there." There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer "You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!" (in portuguese). 

Thats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: "You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away." I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. 

So reddit? Is it wrong to film inside an airport? Was she right and I wrong?

TL;DR: I was filming a chaotic situation at the transfer desk in Lisbon airport because the TAP staff was being super unhelpful and rude. A lady from the press told me I couldn't film and I put it down. Was I wrong to film?

**Comments:**

* "It's generally not illegal to film in public places, including airports, as long as you're not disrupting the normal functioning of the airport or violating any specific rules or regulations. However, it's always a good idea to be respectful of others and to ask permission before filming someone or something that's not in a public area."
* "I think you were in the right to film, but it's understandable that the lady from the press was trying to protect her sources and the situation. Maybe you could have asked her if you could film and she would have said no, and then you could have respected her wishes."
* "I think it's a bit of a gray area, but I think you were in the right to film. The airport is a public place and you have the right to document what's happening. However, it's also important to be respectful of others and not disrupt the normal functioning of the airport."

TITLE: My girlfriend [24/F] wanted to break up with me [23/F] - did I wrong her?

POST: We've dated for about a month and a half. She wanted a serious relationship. To preface the situation - she told me about a time when she was having exams, and she vomited. Her parents or boyfriend at the time would take care of her.

I came down with a bad fever and was coughing blood. I took a week off school and work. She took time off studying to spend half a day taking care of me. Two days later, she has her final exam. While I'm at home recovering, she calls me to let me know that she feels extremely ill and threw up in the middle of her exam. I tell her that she should call 911 immediately as I won't be able to come to her and she does that, and is hospitalized for the day. I do not visit her, as I feel quite sick and fear that I may have passed something to her.

The next day, she goes home to recover, but is still feeling quite down. I go to visit my parents to pick up some mail. I ask if she needs anything at this time, and she declines, telling me that she doesn't need me to help her now.

A week later, she tells me that she wants to break up over the situation. Her friend had to take care of her in the hospital, and he asked where her boyfriend (me) was. She also pointed out that I was feeling good enough to visit my parents. I was still coughing blood and had a fever at that point, and wasn't thinking very clearly. I had feared that I may have passed something to my girlfriend and that visiting her in the hospital could be bad for both of us.

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to break up with me because I didn't visit her in the hospital when she was sick, and because I visited my parents instead. I was feeling unwell and didn't want to risk getting her sick.

What do you think? Did I wrong her?

TITLE: My [18M] Girlfriend [17F] lives in an abusive household

POST: Hello, Reddit.  I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.

First off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.

My girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  

Even when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.

My mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.  I would love to hear reddit's opinion and if you guys think there's anything we can do to help her.  We are all here to support and and do whatever we can.

TL;DR: My girlfriend lives in an abusive household with her bipolar mother who physically and emotionally abuses her and her siblings.  Her mother tries to control every aspect of her life and even goes on her social media accounts to read her conversations.  We want to help her but aren't sure what kind of solution could be presented.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance to individuals facing difficult situations. The OP (original poster) is seeking advice on how to help his girlfriend, Samantha, who is living in an abusive household with her mother.

Others suggest that the OP and Samantha should work together to develop a plan to help her leave the abusive household and start a new life.

TITLE: I'm [M20] worried about emotional manipulation from girlfriend [F20].

POST: I've found recently that my girlfriend has been saying things which make me feel uncomfortable dye to the way they're said. We're not doing great at the minute so I'm concerned this is changing my thinking. 

Essentially, we had an argument recently and now talking between us is more stilted (we're in different countries right now, by the way). The things that have me worried are when she says things like she needs to talk to me to distract her from thinking about hurting herself and that she "hopes I know" she's depending on me to make her happy. 

I don't want to seem overly selfish, I'm concerned about that. Of course I want to help and I have for as long as we have been dating (around a year and a half now). It just feels like some of these things are more of a threat than asking for help. This is partially caused by the fact that when I try to offer suggestions they're met with rejection as being too hard, not what she wants as the solution or simply as not going to work. 

I feel guilty writing this and I feel guiltier that I've been considering the future of our relationship recently. It feels like she's making sure I know just how guilty I should feel if I left. This is made worse by her recently accusing me of fostering her dependency on me while I'm not dependant on her (I'm not sure how I did this and when I tried to offer her ways of becoming more independent they were shot down). 

Am I being selfish here and thinking too much about my self, not enough about her? I do want to help and I don't want to make it all about me but these thoughts keep coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do so any advice is appreciated. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before?
Am I wrong here and being overly defensive or is this manipulative?
Most importantly, where do I go from here?

TL;DR: I'm worried about emotional manipulation from my girlfriend. She says things that make me feel uncomfortable and I'm not sure if I'm being selfish or if she's genuinely struggling. I want to help but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and I'm not sure what to do.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being reasonable to be concerned. It sounds like she's using guilt trips and emotional blackmail to get what she wants from you. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness in a relationship. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being."
* "I've been in a similar situation before and it's not okay. It's not about being selfish, it's about being aware of your own emotional boundaries and not being taken advantage of. You have every right to express your concerns and needs to your girlfriend. Don't feel guilty for wanting to prioritize your own emotional well-being."
* "I think you're being too focused on your own feelings and not enough on your girlfriend's struggles. It sounds like she's really struggling with depression and anxiety, and she's using you as a crutch. You should be trying to support her and help her get the help she needs, rather than focusing on your own feelings of guilt and manipulation."
* "I think you're being too quick to assume that your girlfriend is manipulating you. Maybe she's just really struggling and doesn't know how to express herself in a healthy way. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? Maybe you can work through this together and find a way to support each other."
* "I think you're being too focused on your own feelings and not enough on your girlfriend's feelings. It sounds like she's really hurt and vulnerable, and you're not giving her the support and understanding she needs. You should be trying to be more empathetic and understanding, rather than focusing on your own feelings of guilt and manipulation."

TITLE: I think my beagle is sick. Can anyone offer any insight/share any similar experiences? (x-post /r/beagle)

POST: So last Friday (March 29th) my 5 and a half year old beagle, Miles, started acting weirdly. He would start shaking and quietly whining. My family and I chalked it up to being in a new environment since we brought him to stay with us overnight at my grandparents' new home. This wasn't too worrying to us, since Miles is epileptic (relatively common among beagles) and we assumed he was having a mild seizure. But the problem persisted through the night and every couple hours he would start shaking again on every inhale. Also, he refuses to jump onto the furniture he knows he's allowed on; he chooses to stay on the floor and whine or I have to pick him up to be on the furniture with me. What I noticed starting yesterday is that he seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches. I tried lightly poking him in those areas every couple of hours and every time I do, he yelps. 

Throughout all of this I noticed what worries me the most. As any beagle owner would know, beagles can't shut up around food. Never before has Miles acted calm around food, let alone slept in his kennel during Easter lunch in a strange environment. He won't run up to snatch a treat out of my hand, either. I have to offer it to him a few inches from his nose, or, if I throw it on the floor he might be bothered to mosey on over and chomp it up very slowly. 

Does anyone know what may be wrong with him?

TL;DR: My 5.5-year-old beagle, Miles, has been acting strangely since last Friday. He's been shaking, whining, and refusing to jump onto furniture. He also seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches, and is acting unusually calm around food. Has anyone experienced anything similar with their beagle?

---

**Comments:**

* "I'm no expert, but it sounds like Miles might be in some kind of discomfort or pain. Have you taken him to the vet yet? It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to our furry friends."
* "I've had a similar experience with my beagle, Luna. She started acting weirdly and wouldn't eat for a few days. Turns out she had a urinary tract infection. Make sure to get Miles checked out ASAP."
* "I'm no vet, but I've heard that beagles can get pancreatitis. It's a common issue in small breeds. Maybe that's what's going on with Miles?"
* "I've had experience with beagles and seizures. It's possible that Miles is having a seizure disorder that's not being properly managed. Have you talked to his vet about adjusting his medication?"
* "I'm not a vet, but I've seen dogs act strangely when they're in pain or discomfort. Maybe Miles is experiencing some kind of arthritis or hip issue? You should definitely take him to the vet to rule out anything serious."
* "I've had a beagle with a similar issue. It turned out to be a hernia. Make sure to get Miles checked out ASAP. Better safe than sorry."

**Upvotes:** 234

**Downvotes:** 12

This post has received a significant amount of engagement, with many users offering their insights and sharing their own experiences with their beagles. The post has been upvoted over 200 times, indicating that the community is concerned about Miles' health and wants to help. The comments range from suggestions of possible causes (urinary tract infection, pancreatitis, seizure disorder, arthritis, hip issue, hernia) to general advice (taking Miles to the vet, managing his medication, ruling out anything serious). The post has also received a few downvotes, likely from users who are not experts in veterinary medicine and are skeptical of the advice being offered. Overall, the post has sparked a helpful and supportive conversation in the r/dogs community.

TITLE: [insurance] I can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family

POST: Okay... Long story short.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. 

We went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)

I would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.

Sorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.

TL;DR: We went from $90/month to $750/month for insurance after my wife left teaching and I went part-time. We can't afford it and are looking for help navigating the system to get affordable insurance.

This post is an example of a personal finance problem that many people may face, especially those who are self-employed or have irregular income.

TITLE: Me [26F] with my boyfriend [37M] of 11 months, long distance relationship says I'm being to needy.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months, the first few months of which we lived in the same city. He recently moved away for work and we are now living in different countries.

  If I had my way we would be texting trough out the day because that's just the way I operate and when something noteworthy happens, he is the first I want to tell. That doesn't go over well with him because he feels like I am bombarding him and he can't get other things done, which I'm fine with. I've been trying to keep my texting to minimum. 

 We've also had other issues where he was feeling suffocated when I wanted to spend the night with him most nights, but we worked through it.

 So right now we are trying to make this long distance thing work and I know he doesn't like to text or be texted a lot so I suggested (after reading a whole bunch of long distance relationship tips online) that the first person to wake up or go to bed would text the other goodnight or good morning. That way we know we are thinking about each other and it's a way to keep our everyday contact alive even if we are thousands of miles away.

 While he initially liked the idea and texted goodnight and good morning he has not done so these past couple days. I brought it up to him and he got very defensive and said that I was being needy and that he doesn't want to text me because he HAS to be because he WANTS to, which I totally understand. Except when I've tried to just let things flow I'll get one text every two days and that's just not enough I feel to keep a long distance relationship alive. So I would like an outside opinion on this; Am I being to needy? Should I just be grateful for the attention he gives me and leave it at that?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and I'm trying to keep our everyday contact alive by suggesting we text each other goodnight and good morning. He initially liked the idea but hasn't done it in a couple days and got defensive when I brought it up, saying I'm being needy. Am I being too needy or should I just be grateful for the attention he gives me?

**Community Response:**

The community is divided on this issue, with some users agreeing with the boyfriend's perspective and others siding with the OP. Here are some common themes and quotes from the comments:

**Neediness:**

* "I think you're being a bit needy, OP. You're trying to control the communication and dictate how often you should be in touch. It's understandable, but it's not healthy for a relationship." - u/throwaway123456
* "I get where you're coming from, but it sounds like you're trying to fill a void by constantly texting him. Maybe try to focus on other things and not rely so much on him for validation?" - u/sarcastic_sally

**Communication:**

* "I think the issue is that you're not communicating your needs effectively. Instead of assuming he'll text you, try having an open and honest conversation about what you need from him in terms of communication." - u/relationshipgoals
* "It's not about being needy, it's about being clear about what you want and need from the relationship. Maybe try setting boundaries and expectations instead of assuming he'll just know what to do." - u/communicationiskey

**Gratitude:**

* "I think you should be grateful for the attention he gives you, OP. It's not like he's ignoring you completely. Maybe try to appreciate the little things and not focus so much on the lack of communication." - u/happy_to_help
* "I agree that you should be grateful for what you have, but it's also important to communicate your needs and wants. Maybe try finding a compromise that works for both of you." - u/relationshipadvice

**Long Distance Relationship:**

* "Long distance relationships are tough, and it's normal to feel like you're not getting enough attention. Maybe try to focus on the things you can control, like staying in touch regularly and planning visits." - u/livingabroad
* "I think the key to a successful long distance relationship is finding ways to stay connected and maintain intimacy. Maybe try scheduling regular video calls or sending surprise gifts to keep the spark alive." - u/ldr

Overall, the community is divided on whether the OP is being too needy or not. Some users agree that she should be grateful for the attention she's getting and not focus so much on the lack of communication, while others think she has a right to communicate her needs and wants in the relationship. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and her boyfriend to work out a compromise that works for both of them.

TITLE: Dog with sore paw.. not a happy pup! Please help?

POST: So tonight I have to take my dog back to the vet, for his wee paw. He has been ill today and keeps 'fighting' with the cone he has on to stop him licking the sore part of his paw. My problem is that i have to get him to the vets tonight, we're getting a taxi but I'm not sure how to get him from our house to the car! basically when i go near him he gets very agitated, so my question is how do i calm him down enough to pick him up? Because he cant walk on the paw its the only way I'll get him out to the taxi :/

TL;DR: Dog with sore paw, needs to go to vet tonight, but getting him from house to car is a struggle. How can I calm him down enough to pick him up?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/pawsitivevibes**: "Ah, poor pup! I'd try using a pheromone spray or a calming aid like L-theanine or melatonin to help calm him down. You could also try wrapping him in a blanket or towel to help him feel more secure. When you do pick him up, make sure to support his paw and lift him gently. Good luck, and I hope the vet visit goes smoothly!"
2. **u/dogmom2010**: "I totally understand your concern! When my pup had a similar issue, I used a combination of treats and verbal calming cues to help him relax. Try using a treat-dispensing toy or a Kong filled with his favorite treats to distract him from the cone. You could also try saying 'easy boy' or 'it's okay' in a calm, soothing voice. When you pick him up, move slowly and gently, and try to avoid sudden movements. Hopefully, the vet visit will be a quick and painless one!"
3. **u/pawsforhelp**: "I'd recommend using a carrier or a pet stroller to transport your pup to the vet. It might be more comfortable for him, and you can avoid having to pick him up altogether. If that's not an option, try using a harness and leash to guide him to the car. Make sure to move slowly and calmly, and avoid pulling on the leash. Good luck, and I hope your pup feels better soon!"

POST: This is a throw-away, and as kind and respectful as you are Reddit, I want your honest opinions.

Over the weekend, I ended up sleeping with two different girls within about a 14 hour period.

The first girl was early in the day, maybe 1-2pm.  I was talking to her and asked her to come over and get lunch and make out.  Her and I have sort of dating the last year.  I say sort of because it has never been official, we've discussed it numerous times and never decided to make it exclusive.  We have sort of a cutesy relationship in terms of how we act around each other, so it's not a clean pump and dump.  She lives about an hour and a half away, and I see her maybe once a month if that.  We're kind of on the tail-end of whatever it was we've been doing for the last year or so.

Then later that night another girl called and asked to hang out.  She has a thing for me, and I'm conflicted.  She's cool, and a solid friend, but sometimes attractive to me, sometimes not.  Everything was normal, and we watched a couple episodes of LOST, and then I told her I wanted to go to sleep (asleep sleep).  Then jokingly asked her if she wanted to start drinking, somehow we ended up drinking, and 2 hours or so later, she told me she was tired and we needed to go lay-down.  We have a slight history of hooking up.  Like twice in a couple of months.  Anyway, she obviously stayed the night, and we ended up sleeping together.  How should I feel about myself for doing this?

TL;DR: I slept with two girls within 14 hours.  One is someone I've been seeing for a year, but we're not official.  The other is a friend who I've hooked up with a couple times.  How crappy of a person am I for doing this?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not a bad person for doing what you wanted to do, but you might want to consider being honest with the first girl about what happened. It's not fair to keep her in the dark and potentially lead her on."
* "You're not a bad person, but you're definitely a selfish one. You're prioritizing your own desires over the feelings of others. That's not a great quality to have."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're an adult, and you're allowed to make your own choices. If you're not hurting anyone, then what's the problem?"
* "You're not a bad person, but you're definitely making some questionable decisions. You need to think about what you want and what's best for you, and then make some changes."
* "I think you're being too focused on what others think of you. You need to focus on what makes you happy and what you want out of life. If sleeping with two girls in one day makes you happy, then that's okay. Just be honest with yourself and others about your intentions."

TITLE: I [17M] am confused as to what I want with my gf [18F] of a little over a year

POST: We started dating my junior, her senior year and have been ever since. Now I am a senior and she is away at a college within reasonable driving distance. I love her and she loves me. While we are content with each other (we like to see each other, like some of the same things) I do have a few concerns about us. 

1) I have never had another serious relationship with anyone else. I feel like I cant make an informed decision of weather I an truly happy here unless I take some time to sort me out and try dating some other people to see what its like.

2) While some of our interests overlap, other things don't mix, our love languages are different (I'm big on touch, her not so much, but she puts up with it to an extent), we like different kinds of movies and stuff etc

3) Our families are from different socioeconomic classes, mine higher than hers. This isin't a big deal to me, but it adds stress to when I think about a possible future for us (how we would deal with bills/stuff, her family (and extended family) structure is different, much larger than mine and just a completely different dynamic).

4) While every time I have told her I love her, I have 100% meant it, I think I'm too young to choose a forever partner. I think I need to build my own life and see what else is out there.

I have been discussing this with her and we considered an open relationship so I can see what else is out there, and while she agreed at the time, I don't think she is ok with me being with anyone else while we are "together", which I completely understand, but in that case I don't want to string her along if the end goal is to just be "ok" this year and break it off when I go to college net year. 

She says I'm selfish, and I agree, but I'm having to weigh my love for her vs. doing what is best for me.

TL;DR: I'm 17, been dating my 18-year-old girlfriend for over a year, but I'm feeling uncertain about our future. I want to explore other relationships, but she's not okay with it. I'm torn between being honest with her and potentially hurting her, or staying in a relationship that might not be the best for me.

RESPONSES:

* "You're not selfish for wanting to explore other relationships and figure out what you want. It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain about your future with your girlfriend. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she may be willing to work through these issues with you, or she may realize that she's not ready for an open relationship. Either way, it's better to be honest and upfront with each other than to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for you."
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and desires. It's not selfish to want to explore other relationships and figure out what you want.

It's possible that she may be willing to work through these issues with you, or she may realize that she's not ready for an open relationship.

TITLE: What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done in a relationship?

POST: I'm 17 and been dating my girlfriend for over a year. We're having some issues and I'm feeling uncertain about our future. I was thinking about doing something ridiculous to shake things up and get us talking about our feelings. Has anyone else ever done something crazy in a relationship? What was it and how did it turn out?

RESPONSES:

TITLE: How do I [22M] confront my friend (and ex girlfriend) [21F] about my remaining feelings for her

POST: Recently myself [22M] and a friend of three years [21F] (not close, on and off) hooked up and from there began a relationship. We dated for four months before she called time on it in January because she "wanted to be alone" and by herself for the last few months of our last year of University (although she followed this up by saying she would probably "regret" her decision in a few weeks and that I was "the best" boyfriend she'd ever had, great closure, huh?).

I understand all her reasoning behind it, the last year being stressful and to add a relationship onto that would be extra tough. However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted "No Contact" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party/gathering with her and have everything rush back.

I'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.

I don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly. I was thinking of inviting her to have lunch at a neutral location (a cafe on campus or similar) and talking to her there.

So, the crux of the matter is what do I say and how do I go about it? I don't want her to feel like its her fault or that I'm going to ignore her / be a dick about it. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm a 22M who still has feelings for my 21F ex girlfriend who broke up with me in January. I want to confess this to her, but don't know how to approach the conversation. I'm thinking of inviting her to lunch and talking to her there. Any advice on what to say and how to go about it would be great.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, I think you're being really brave for acknowledging your feelings and wanting to be honest with her. Just remember to be respectful and considerate of her feelings too. Maybe start by expressing your appreciation for the time you spent together and how much you value your friendship. Then, be honest about your feelings and how they've been affecting you. It's okay if she doesn't feel the same way, but at least you'll know where you stand."
* "I think a phonecall is a good idea. It's more personal than a text, but still allows you to have a private conversation. You could also consider meeting in person, like you mentioned, but make sure you choose a public place where you both feel comfortable. Remember to be calm and respectful, and try not to put too much pressure on the conversation. It's okay if she doesn't want to rekindle things, but at least you'll know where you stand."
* "I think you're being really selfish for still having feelings for her after she's made it clear she wants to be alone. Maybe you should focus on moving on and finding someone who is actually interested in you. You deserve better than someone who is just going to string you along."
* "I think you should just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, then that's okay. You can still be friends and move on. But if you don't tell her, you'll always wonder what could have been. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way, and try not to get too attached to the idea of getting back together."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about your feelings, but also be prepared to accept that she might not feel the same way. It's okay if she doesn't want to rekindle things, and you should respect her decision. You can still be friends and move on. Just remember to be respectful and considerate of her feelings, and try not to get too attached to the idea of getting back together."

TITLE: Me [23 M/F] with my two best friends who date each other [22 M and F] of 4 years, found out one cheated and need advice

POST: Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.

Earlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like "2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. 

Now, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. 

I know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.

So reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

TL;DR: Best friend (22 M) cheated on his girlfriend (22 F) 2 years ago, contacted the girl again this spring, and I found out through another friend. I'm torn between keeping it to myself and telling his girlfriend, but I'm scared of the consequences. Help me out, reddit.

TITLE: TIFU by trying all six sliders at Steak & Shake

POST: This actually happened when I was young, but you understand. 

It was about 1 in the morning and I was out with the boys. They were playing cards on our table at Steak & Shake while I watched. We order our meals. I was indecisive and so I told the waiter "1 of every slider!". He put down his pad and said "Really, dude?". I don't tolerate this kind of disrespect and saw it as a challenge. "Yes," I said, "All six, with cheese!" About 35 minutes pass and I've drank all my water. No refill would be given to me. The boys finished their meals and we're ready to leave. I said "Hold on fellas, let me eat! but they wanted to leave NOW. So I crammed the last 2 sliders, a buffalo and a frisco, right into my mouth and swalloed. However, they got caught in my throat. Having no drink I could not down them. My instincts kicked in and I projectile vomited onto the table, including on the man's tip. I got up and said to my buddies "We gotta get out of here, boys." They asked me why just as the waiter came to the table and began to gag. We ran. And since then the boys refuse to buy me lunch or even take me to lunch.

TL;DR: I tried all six sliders at Steak & Shake, got sick, and projectile vomited on the table and the waiter's tip. Now my friends won't take me to lunch.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author, who was young at the time, tried to order all six sliders at Steak & Shake, which was a bold and impulsive decision. The consequences of this decision were severe, as they ended up vomiting on the table and the waiter's tip. The author's friends were understandably upset and refused to take them to lunch after the incident. The post is a humorous and relatable example of how one's actions can have unintended and embarrassing consequences.

TITLE: I want to understand his point of view on this monogamy issue...

POST: ok.  We have been together 5 years, me and his both 24.  I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner

Quick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  

Similar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.

TL;DR: I'm in a 5 year relationship with a 24 year old. He wants an open relationship, but I don't feel comfortable with it because he won't allow me to be with another man. He thinks I'm playing tit for tat and being unreasonable. I feel like he's being unfair and not considering my feelings.

---

This post is a great example of a common issue in relationships: conflicting desires and expectations around monogamy and sexual freedom. The OP (original poster) is struggling to understand their SO's perspective on this issue, and is seeking advice from the community.

The OP's concerns are centered around the fact that their SO is unwilling to compromise on their desire for an open relationship, while also being unwilling to allow the OP to explore their own desires with other men. The OP feels that this is unfair and disrespectful, and that their SO is not considering their feelings or needs.

The OP's SO's perspective, as described in the post, is that the OP is being unreasonable and playing tit for tat. They feel that the OP is not respecting their desires and needs, and that they are being selfish.

This is a classic example of a power imbalance in a relationship, where one partner has more control and agency than the other. The OP's SO is able to dictate the terms of the relationship and expect the OP to conform to their desires, without being willing to compromise or consider the OP's needs.

The community's response to this post is likely to be a mix of empathy and advice. Some people may offer words of encouragement and support, while others may provide more practical advice on how to navigate this issue. Some possible responses might include:

* "It sounds like your SO is being really unfair and controlling. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and needs?"
* "I understand where your SO is coming from, but it's not fair to expect you to compromise on something that's so important to you. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you."
* "Have you considered compromise? Maybe you could agree to an open relationship, but with certain boundaries or rules in place to make you feel more comfortable?"
* "It's not about playing tit for tat, it's about respecting each other's needs and desires. Maybe your SO needs to understand that you're not just asking for permission to be with someone else, but also for the freedom to make your own choices and decisions."

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication, compromise, and respect in any relationship. It also underscores the need for partners to be willing to listen to each other's needs and desires, and to work together to find a solution that works for both parties.

TITLE: TIFU: By recognizing a girl i went to HS with on Reddit and telling her.

POST: throwaway for obvious reasons. THIS HAPPENED TODAY.

She posted a pic of herself celebrating something and decided to share on the website, and got alot of points for it. Thus, being seen by alot of people. I.E ME. My first reaction was "oh good for this person, that's amazing". My second reaction was something like..."wait I know those eyes". This was around 2 AM. So the genius that I am decides to message her pretty much stating (insert name here)? I thought to myself, that's not creepy right? It probably is, but she'll understand. if anything she'll ask who this is. NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO WRONG IN MY LIFE. Since i'm still up I decided to log back in and see if I had gotten a reply. she NOPE'D outta there and deleted her account. So I probably made her **SUUUPER** uncomfortable, and people really don't need that. if you happen to read this know that I'm incredibly sorry and I will never do that again. uhh. congrats.... :(

TL;DR: Recognized a girl from HS on Reddit, messaged her, and now she's deleted her account.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) recognized a girl from their high school on Reddit, got excited, and decided to message her. However, they didn't consider the potential consequences of their actions and ended up making the girl uncomfortable, leading her to delete her account.

The post is relatable because it highlights the importance of considering the impact of our actions on others. The OP's mistake was not thinking about how their message might be perceived by the girl, and they ended up causing her distress. The post also serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of respecting people's privacy and boundaries online.

The tone of the post is apologetic and self-deprecating, with the OP acknowledging their mistake and expressing regret for their actions. The use of humor and irony ("throwaway for obvious reasons," "if anything she'll ask who this is. NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO WRONG IN MY LIFE") adds a lighthearted touch to the post and helps to make it more relatable and entertaining. Overall, the post is a great example of how to share a TIFU story in a way that is both humorous and informative.

TITLE: Laid off after two days on the job, what's a entry level person to do?

POST: Fresh out of college, trying to get a job as a server though I have little to no experience with it. I really wanted the job because serving is a skill I want to have experience with. This local business hired me, I told them upfront I had no experience but was a quick learner. They started me off first day as a dishwasher, and I handled it fine. The second day they wanted to start training me as a busboy and ease my way into a serving position. I was so excited for this opportunity to move up that quickly. I paid close attention, asked a question for clarity when I didn't understand something, and made sure that the guests were well attended to. At the end of the night they told me good job and though there were a few things I needed to work on they didn't expect much for my first try at it. 
I go into work today and the manager (who wasn't there the night before) sat me down and told me that they were letting me go because they didn't feel I wasn't good enough and that they needed someone with more restaurant experience. Though I only worked there for a few days I was devastated. It's a shitty shitty feeling when someone tells you you're not good enough. I mean, I'm smart I'm competent I feel like I'll pick things up once I get a hang of things. 

I've been scrolling through Craigslist the past few hours looking at more restaurant positions and all of them say the same thing "2+ years experience required." Even a dish washing position is required to have multiple years of experience. I feel like the problem out there isn't that there aren't any jobs, there's tons of them I just looked at. It's just the pool of unemployed is so large that businesses are demanding the highest of qualifications for some of the most entry leveled jobs. So my question is how is someone who isn't as qualified compete in our world today?

TL;DR: Laid off after two days on the job, feeling devastated and unsure of how to compete in the job market with little to no experience.

---

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/AskReddit, where users can share their personal stories and ask for advice from the community.

TITLE: Texting charges? USA to europe

POST: Not sure if this is the best subreddit but I'm at a restaurant in Italy on my iPhone and I couldn't find anything better. I have AT&T and paid for 500 texts for while I'm here. I just checked my at&t app and it says I've used 57/500 texts, but I'm pretty sure between sending and receiving its been more. Does it charge for both, or just sending?
I've been texting my boyfriend who is in California, he has Verizon. Does it charge him to text me while I'm here? I figured it would charge me both ways and the 500 I bought would cover it but now I'm concerned since it only says I've used 57. I haven't counted I'm just pretty sure it's more.

TL;DR: Texting charges while in Europe with AT&T. Does it charge for both sending and receiving, or just sending? And does it charge my boyfriend with Verizon to text me while I'm here?

---

This post is an example of a common concern for travelers: understanding how their phone plan works while abroad. The user is trying to figure out how AT&T's texting charges work, specifically whether they charge for both sending and receiving texts, and whether their boyfriend with Verizon will be charged to text them while they're abroad.

The post is well-written and provides enough context for the reader to understand the situation. The user is also showing effort to find the answer by checking their AT&T app and counting the number of texts they've sent and received. The post is also concise and easy to read, making it a good example of a well-written post.

The post also shows a good understanding of the subreddit's rules, as it is a clear and concise question that is relevant to the subreddit's topic. The user is also showing respect for the community by acknowledging that it may not be the best subreddit for their question, but they're willing to ask anyway.

Overall, this post is a good example of a well-written and relevant question that is likely to receive helpful responses from the community.

TITLE: I am [19F], and my mother wouldn't approve of me 'online dating'.

POST: I'm so sorry this is all so muddled, I just don't know how to explain it properly. Also wasn't sure what to flair this as, so I just put it as 'dating'.

I am a 19 year old female, never had a boyfriend and only had my first kiss a few months ago, so I'm relatively 'innocent'. I know Tinder isn't really a "dating app" but I installed it a few months ago just for fun, until it turned into me actually agreeing to meet up with guys who I hit it off with. But I'm facing the problem of my mother, who I haven't told that I'm meeting people online, because I know she would get angry or not allow me to meet people.

I've only met one guy from Tinder in real life, and the only reason I did was because I lied to my mum about where I was. Today I was supposed to meet up and have lunch with another guy I met on Tinder, so I told my mum I was having lunch with a boy in the city. I was contemplating just saying I was having lunch with friends, but decided to tell her i was going with a boy, but not that I met him online. Then I realised that i made a massive mistake, as now I have practically dug a grave for myself, when i told her I met him locally when he actually lives nearly and hour and a half away, and became really evasive about other details. So I ended up cancelling the date, and I'm going to be questioned SO much by my mum that i'm going to have to confess that I lied and that I met him online, and that's going to cause a bit of strife.

I feel so pathetic about virtually needing my mother's consent to go and meet people! I know about'stranger danger' and am safe when it comes to this, so how do I go about meeting people from online with my mother being so over-protective? I honestly don't know how anyone my age does it.

TL;DR: I'm 19F, never had a boyfriend, and I'm online dating in secret because my mum wouldn't approve. I met a guy from Tinder and lied to my mum about it, and now I'm in trouble. How do I deal with this situation?

**Comments:**

* "Girl, I feel you. I'm 20 and my parents are super strict too. I've had to sneak around to meet people online. It's not easy, but you gotta do what makes you happy. Just be careful and make sure you're meeting in a public place and telling someone where you're going. And honestly, if your mom is that overprotective, maybe it's time to have a conversation with her about boundaries and respect for your autonomy."
* "I'm 22 and I went through the same thing. I told my parents I was going to a friend's house and ended up meeting someone from Tinder. It was a huge mess, but I learned to be more open with them about my life. Maybe you can try having a conversation with your mom about why you're online dating and what you're looking for. It might help her understand and trust you more."
* "I'm 25 and I'm still dealing with my parents being overprotective. It's hard, but you gotta stand up for yourself and do what makes you happy. Just remember to be safe and responsible, and don't let your parents dictate your life. You're an adult now, and it's time to start making your own decisions."
* "I'm 18 and I'm in a similar situation. I told my parents I was going to a friend's house and ended up meeting someone from Tinder. It was a huge mess, but I learned to be more open with them about my life. Maybe you can try having a conversation with your mom about why you're online dating and what you're looking for. It might help her understand and trust you more."

(This comment is a repeat of the previous one, but with a slightly different wording.)

**Conclusion:**

The post receives a lot of comments from people who have gone through similar experiences, offering words of encouragement and advice. Many of the commenters suggest having an open and honest conversation with their mothers about their online dating experiences, and emphasizing the importance of safety and responsibility.

TITLE: Me [21 M] She [22 w],Made out drunk, wanted more but couldnt.

POST: I was on her birthday party. We liked us for a year and saw each other in a couple of small house parties but i wasnt sure how much she liked me. 

Well the moment i entered the party she made it pretty clear where we both stand. 

She was already drunk and was quite touchy. When we were alone i went for the kiss and we made out a couple of minutes until she had to go back to the party. 

Well over the time of the party we made out on and off when we had time and space. 

We both were now pretty clear that we wanted more. 

The problem was that we had to wait for the party to end. Wellll that didnt happen. I eventually left at 5 in the morning tired we agreed that i d call her the next day. 

Me leaving her alone wasnt the best feeling but staying was a torture i couldnt have made it without falling asleep.

I called her today. We will meet this week.

I think we know each other quite good but i believe she doesnt know me aswell as she may think and that freaks me out.

TL;DR: Made out with a girl at her birthday party, we both wanted more but couldn't act on it until the party ended. We'll meet this week, but I'm worried she doesn't know me as well as she thinks.

TITLE: TIFU by throwing my shitty slipper at an old lady.

POST: This happened 10 minutes ago. I was walking home from the grocery store— a full bag of stuff ranging from milk to toothpaste, in either hand. This stuff was really heavy, so I wasn't really looking down, scanning the road for potential shit for my feet to squish; I just wanted to get home quickly before my arms separated from my body. You can probably guess what happened next, I stamped on a surprisingly large piece of dog shit. Or maybe it could be human shit, who knows. I don't know my shit. I didn't know what to do. My house was just two blocks away, but I didn't want to keep walking in my shitty slippers. So I decided I'd try to shake most of the shit off of it. I shook. Nothing happened. I shook harder. Nothing happened. This shit was made of super glue. I see the old lady who always wants to start a conversation with me for some reason; she's approaching me. I freak out. My arms pain really bad. So I shake my slipper really violently, and it comes off and flies right at the old. It hit her left boob, shit side up. I didn't know what to do, again. I was freaking out even more now. I had two options— wait, apologise, take my shitty slipper home and have a fucking long conversation with the annoying lady; or run home one slipper less. I really didn't want to talk to the lady, and eh, I could buy new slippers. I had just a few seconds before she approached; the shock of the flying shitty slipper was still with her. I committed, and ran— nay, wobbled like a penguin wearing one slipper. This still isn't over. The handles of one of the bags tore. It fell off. I lost my wobble-rhythm and the other one fell too. I lost my balance and fell with it. I just left all the stuff there and sprinted home.
I don't know what I'm going to tell my mom.

TL;DR: I threw my slipper at an old lady after stepping in dog shit and it hit her boob. I ran home with one slipper and lost the other bag. I'm going to die.

TITLE: Should I [16m] tell her [16f] how I feel/felt? Ready to move on/make last ditch effort after 2 months of flirting

POST: Male 16. So I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now, and we really seemed to click. A few weeks ago she was being really flirty, and seemed like she wanted me to ask her out. I was waiting for the right time to ask her out, but she was never just by herself with me to ask. 

   A week went by and I tried talk to her and she just seemed really distant, like she almost wanted nothing to do with me. We had this off and on relationship of her being really flirty and then really distant. This has lasted 5 weeks. This [thread] I posted in r/teenrelationships sums it up pretty well. 

   Anyways, I'm ready to make one last ditch effort/try to move on. What I'm asking for is advice on this one matter: Should I tell her how I feel? I think it could help me get my feelings for her off of my chest and make it easier to move on. On the other hand, if she gets all touched and stuff and wants to go out with me after that, then hey, that's great.

   I do realize that telling girls how you feel isn't really fair to them by overloading them with all of that baggage. I do realize that I could create a completely irreparable relationship with this girl. I'm just ready to make one last ditch effort, or make an effort to move on.

   What do I do, r/relationships? Do I tell her how I feel, or do I just soldier on?

TL;DR: 16m, been talking to 16f for 2 months, been flirting, but she's been distant. Ready to make one last ditch effort or move on. Should I tell her how I feel? Will it help me move on or create a bad relationship?

TITLE: [16m] and [16f] - 5 weeks of on and off flirting, distant behavior, and uncertainty

POST: Hey guys, I'm a 16-year-old male and I'm really confused about this girl I've been talking to. We've been talking for about 5 weeks now, and it's been a rollercoaster of emotions. 

   At first, she was really into me, flirting and stuff. But then she would just go cold on me for a week or two, and I'd be left wondering what I did wrong. This has happened multiple times. 

   I've tried talking to her about it, but she just says she's busy or stressed. I've also tried giving her space, but it seems like the more space I give her, the more distant she becomes. 

   I'm starting to think that maybe she's just not that interested in me, but I don't want to give up on her yet. I feel like we have a connection, but I'm not sure what to do. 

   Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How did you handle it? Should I just move on or keep trying?

TL;DR: 16m, been talking to 16f for 5 weeks, on and off flirting, distant behavior, and uncertainty. What do I do? Should I keep trying or move on?

Both posts are from the same user, and they are asking for advice on how to handle their situation with the girl they've been talking to. The first post is more focused on whether or not to tell the girl how he feels, while the second post is more focused on the uncertainty and confusion he's feeling in the relationship.

The user is 16 years old, and the girl is also 16 years old. They have been talking for about 2 months, and the user is feeling frustrated and unsure about how to proceed.

The posts are both seeking advice and guidance from the community, and the user is looking for help on how to navigate the situation and make a decision about what to do next.

The posts are both relevant to the subreddit r/relationships, as they are both about relationships and seeking advice on how to handle a difficult situation. The posts are also relevant to the subreddit r/teenrelationships, as they are both about relationships and dating among teenagers.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my married online friend [30 F] 3 months, strained emotional relationship

POST: I posted a few weeks back but deleted the post. The summary of the situation is this: I met a female gamer playing an mmo who is currently married with two kids  and is in an emotionally abusive marriage. She has been in this marriage for 10 years. My insecurities caused a rift and our contact has become strained. 

We became close, feelings were very strong and we professed our mutual love for each other. We chatted and Skyped often. 

In time, though, my insecurities and unease with the situation placed stress upon us both which has brought me to where we are. I tried to break off contact two weeks ago and stated as such. She was devastated and I ended up being unable to follow through. We decided our best bet was to try and remove the emotional side from it and I have been unable to do so.

I've really struggled with everything. I feel like I love this woman and I know that my constant worries and questions caused the rift. It became very hard to not feel sad when her husband would call and interrupt our Skype sessions. Or when she suddenly changed factions in the game we played and seemed no longer wanting to play with me. I would make my feelings known and she tried to reassure me. It all became too much, as she felt as if it wasn't enough and she couldn't be enough. 

This past week, I told her that I couldn't handle just being friends right now and I should try to take some space. She explained that she doesn't feel the same as she once did and she doesn't know what the future holds. She said she isn't able to write things off for good yet but space and time are important. 

My questions are this:

Is there hope or is it worth holding out hope for a future? 
Am I wrong to feel so bad about how I handled the situation?
How can I overcome my insecurities relative to this situation?

TL;DR: I've been in an emotional relationship with a married woman for 3 months. We professed our love for each other, but my insecurities caused a rift. We're now in a strained situation, and I'm unsure if there's hope for a future or if I'm wrong to feel bad about how I handled it.

TITLE: I sent my estranged friend an anonymous letter and I don't know how to process the response. Advice would be appreciated.

POST: She and I met in freshman year (I was 18, she 17) as neighbors in our dorm. We lived together for several years (about 3) but at some point started to have our insecurities interfere with our relationship. Our friendship faced several set backs and pretty much fizzled out in a rather dramatic fashion. At first this was okay. I was angry and couldn't communicate or forgive. At the time I didn't want to acknowledge that I had made mistakes too. 

A long while had gone by since I'd thought about her. I've been dealing with a lot and have kind of gone down this hermit path, I honestly have no friends in the city I live in. In my loneliness, the thoughts of our good times came to mind and I just started missing her so much. Now go to several days ago - I sent my friend an anonymous message on tumblr basically saying I loved them and always will. Of course this could be interpreted both as friendship-love or romantic, so this could have been unclear. A few messages later (still anonymous) it was basically said that she had realized who it was and that they had let it go (meaning our past problems). 

QUESTION: Now in my note I had hinted I wanted to rekindle our friendship so, should I take this 'all is forgiven' attitude as she is over the past and that's it- no chance; or, is the person over the past and open to something? Sorry that was pretty drawn out or if this all seems petty. It's just this person meant so much to me at one point. My feelings got hurt and I hurt their feelings, and then it was just done. Time has passed, making reconciliation that much more unlikely.

Am I being delusional or weird for holding on to some memory of a person?

TL;DR: I sent an anonymous letter to my estranged friend from college, expressing my love and wanting to rekindle our friendship. She responded, saying she's over the past and willing to move forward. I'm unsure if this means she's open to rekindling our friendship or if she's just letting go of the past. Should I take this as a sign that she's over the past and willing to move forward, or is she just forgiving and not interested in rekindling our friendship?

---

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you're being way too optimistic about the situation. She's not saying she's open to rekindling your friendship, she's just saying she's over the past. That doesn't mean she's willing to start over or even talk to you again. You're reading way too much into it."
* **u/sadpanda1992**: "I think you should take this as a sign that she's willing to move forward, but not necessarily rekindle your friendship. Maybe she's just willing to let go of the past and move on with her life. You could try reaching out to her again, but this time be clear about what you're looking for. Don't assume she's interested in rekindling your friendship just because she's over the past."
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're being way too focused on your own feelings and not considering your friend's perspective. You hurt her and then disappeared. She's not obligated to forgive you or rekindle your friendship just because you're feeling nostalgic. You need to take responsibility for your actions and respect her boundaries. If she's willing to move forward, that's great, but don't assume it's because she's interested in rekindling your friendship."
* **u/throwaway789012**: "I think you should take this as a sign that she's willing to move forward, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not be interested in rekindling your friendship. You can't force someone to forgive or forget, and you can't assume that just because she's over the past, she's willing to start over. You need to respect her boundaries and give her space."

**Conclusion:**

The community is divided on how to interpret the friend's response. Some people think she's just saying she's over the past and not necessarily interested in rekindling the friendship, while others think she might be willing to move forward but not necessarily rekindle the friendship. The community advises the OP to take responsibility for their actions, respect their friend's boundaries, and be prepared for the possibility that she might not be interested in rekindling the friendship. Ultimately, the OP needs to consider their friend's perspective and communicate clearly about what they're looking for in the future.

TITLE: My [21 F] boyfriends [26 M] past haunts me.

POST: Basically I want your opinion on dealing with a significant other's past. 

I hate my boyfriend's past. I hate his past relationships, friends with benefits, and friendships with other females that he had before me. I hate the girls he used to be infatuated with, the girls he was attracted to, etc.

I'm the type who asked him for all these details, but ultimately hearing them made me upset and obsessed and filled with hatred.

I snooped on his computer, his old profiles, and found things that I didn't like.

Mind you, this is the PAST. All these things that happened before me, shady or not, are a thing of the past: nonexistent. 

What do you think of your partner's past? How do you deal with it? Do you even care about it? 

I hate my behavior and would love to hear other people's perspectives on this issue.

TL;DR: I'm upset about my boyfriend's past relationships and friends with benefits. I hate the girls he used to be infatuated with. I snooped on his computer and found things I didn't like. I'm consumed by hatred and would love to hear other people's perspectives on this issue.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Honestly, it sounds like you're obsessed with your boyfriend's past. You're letting it consume you and it's affecting your relationship. Try to focus on the present and future with him instead of dwelling on things that are no longer relevant.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: I think it's normal to be curious about your partner's past, but it sounds like you're taking it too far. Snooping on his computer and profiles is not okay. If you have concerns, talk to him about it in a calm and respectful manner. Remember, his past is his own and you can't change it.
3. **u/justme123**: I'm a guy and I can tell you that it's natural to have feelings for someone in the past. But, it's not about you, it's about him. If he's moved on and is committed to you, then that's all that matters. Try to focus on building a strong relationship with him instead of dwelling on his past.
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: I think it's great that you're open about your feelings and willing to listen to others' perspectives. It's normal to have feelings about your partner's past, but try to remember that it's not about you. It's about him and his experiences. Try to focus on the present and future with him instead of dwelling on the past.
5. **u/throwaway789**: I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. If you're consumed by hatred and obsession over your boyfriend's past, then it's not a healthy relationship. You deserve better than to be constantly worried about something that's no longer relevant. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to work through your feelings.

**Note:** The comments are a mix of opinions and advice, ranging from telling the OP to focus on the present and future with her boyfriend to acknowledging that it's normal to have feelings about a partner's past. Some comments also emphasize the importance of communication and respect in a relationship. The OP's post is an example of how social media platforms like Reddit can provide a space for people to share their feelings and receive support and advice from others.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 5 years. I think I want to move on, but I'm scared and feel guilty.

POST: I really love my 25M boyfriend. We've been in a great relationship since the start. We live together. I've now finished school and am unsure of where the whole thing is going. Nothing is really wrong, but I don't feel satisfied. Am I chasing a golden goose?  

**Here's what I love about my relationship with him:**  

* I love the guy and he loves me
* My parents and family love him, which is very important to me
* We agree on all fundamental values & beliefs
* We talk about getting married in general
* He makes me laugh
* He is so smart and caring
* I trust him with absolutely no reservations 
* He is the kindest, most wonderful person in the world and I've never met anyone who didn't like him  

**But**  

* Though we've talked about marriage, there's no proposal/engagement/plan with real goals
* We've been together for so long that I don't remember what it's like to be myself
* I'm attracted to more than one person outside of the relationship, and that terrifies me
* I hate it when I feel like I have to drag him to go out and have fun/justify wanting to go out and have fun (like at bars, dancing, etc)
* He still has 3 more years of school left and that seems like such a long time to wait to settle down
* I feel like I'm trying to justify being unhappy because our relationship is wonderful on paper and I feel like I'm just a shitty whiner/guilty about wanting something different  

So what do you think?  

This is just what happens to people our age, right?  

I'm just a big whiner, right?

TL;DR: I'm 24F, been with my 25M boyfriend for 5 years. I love him, but I'm feeling unsatisfied and unsure about our future. I'm scared to move on and feel guilty for wanting something different. Help me out, Reddit! 

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel unsatisfied in a long-term relationship, especially when you're in your mid-twenties. You're not a bad person for wanting something different. Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you're feeling? Maybe he's not aware of your desires and needs."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in a similar situation with my ex. We were together for 7 years, and I felt like I was just going through the motions. I didn't feel like myself anymore. I eventually realized that I deserved better and ended the relationship. It was scary, but it was the best decision I ever made. You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to have a 'plan' with your boyfriend. Relationships are about growth and evolution, not about having a specific timeline or checklist. Have you talked to your boyfriend about what you're feeling? Maybe he's feeling the same way, but is too afraid to bring it up. Communication is key in any relationship."
4. **u/unsatisfied**: "OP, I'm so glad you're acknowledging your feelings. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're not happy in a relationship. I was in a similar situation with my ex, and I felt like I was just going through the motions. I eventually realized that I deserved better and ended the relationship. It was scary, but it was the best decision I ever made. You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it."
5. **u/relationshipexpert**: "OP, I think you're being too focused on the negative aspects of your relationship. Instead of dwelling on what's not working, try to focus on the positive aspects. What are some things that you love and appreciate about your boyfriend? What are some things that you're grateful for in your relationship? Sometimes, when we focus on the positive, we can find ways to work through the challenges and come out stronger on the other side."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and encouraging. Many users acknowledge that it's normal to feel unsatisfied in a long-term relationship and encourage OP to communicate with her boyfriend about her feelings. Some users share their own experiences of ending relationships that were no longer fulfilling and encourage OP to prioritize her own happiness. The comments also offer advice on how to approach the situation, such as focusing on the positive aspects of the relationship and communicating openly with her boyfriend. Overall, the comments provide a sense of community and support for OP as she navigates this difficult decision.

TITLE: I [F, 24] had a falling out with friend [F, 23], have anxiety when I need to see her in group situations. Help!

POST: I'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.
A few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.

However, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.

Normally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.

Has anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. 

Do you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now? I didn't want to stir drama but was thinking that maybe at least some of my close friends

TL;DR: Had a falling out with a friend, now I have to see her at parties with mutual friends. I feel anxious and unsure how to handle the situation. Should I try to be polite or just avoid her? How did you deal with a similar situation?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I've been in a similar situation before. I would suggest talking to your close friends about what happened. They might not know the whole story and it's better to be open and honest with them. It's also possible that they might be able to help mediate the situation or give you advice on how to handle it. As for being polite, I think it's a good idea to at least try to be friendly. You don't have to be best buds with your former friend, but being rude or ignoring her might make things even more awkward. Just be yourself, be polite, and move on."
2. **u/anonymous123**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and don't worry about what your former friend thinks. You don't owe her an explanation or an apology. If she's still talking about you behind your back, that says more about her character than yours. Focus on your other friends and the positive relationships in your life. You don't have to make an effort to be friends with someone who doesn't respect you."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think it's great that you're considering being polite and not wanting to avoid your former friend. However, you also need to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If seeing her at parties is causing you so much anxiety, it might be okay to take a step back and limit your interactions with her. You don't have to be friends with someone who makes you feel uncomfortable or anxious. Maybe try to find ways to minimize your interactions with her, like sitting on the other side of the room or finding someone else to talk to. Remember, your mental health is important too."
4. **u/someoneelse**: "I've been in a similar situation and I think it's okay to take a break from socializing with your former friend's group for a while. You don't have to cut ties completely, but taking a step back can give you some space to process your emotions and recharge. When you do see her, just be polite and friendly, but don't feel obligated to make small talk or try to rekindle the friendship. You've moved on and that's okay. Remember that you deserve to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you, not drain your energy or make you feel bad about yourself."

TITLE: Finally took the plunge and started NC

POST: It's just over a month since I broke up with my SO. We've seen each other a couple of times since our mutual breakup and he has helped me through some tough personal times since then, but things got really hard for me after I slept with him over a weekend trip away with some mutual friends. I just miss him and regret ever agreeing to our mutual breakup without ever really voicing what I wanted. 

I'd like to think that we will still remain close and supportive friends, and I hope we do, but being able to see his Facebook and follow his every move was just destroying me and making my depression all the more difficult to deal with. Which is why I've (finally) decided to start NC and just get on with myself. I've unfriended him and it was hard but very liberating. I know I'll certainly see him in person in the near future again due to our mutual friends and common interests, but knowing that I don't have to speak to him again unless it's on my terms is both painful and good.

It has been a horrible, painful, depressing ride but lurking around here in /r/Breakups and seeing that I'm not alone has helped a lot. Thanks everyone.

TL;DR: Broke up with SO, slept with him, regretted it, started NC, and feeling liberated but still struggling with depression.

TITLE: [NSFW] BF [22 m] and I [23 f] can't agree on this boundary

POST: Together 2 years.  I'm using a throw away because this is a bit of an awkward problem I don't want associated with my main.

My boyfriend and I are pretty good at compromising, and have always been good about approaching the problem as a team. However, the current discussion we're having is something we've been unable to compromise on.

My boundaries are pretty strongly associated with interaction. So while I have no problem with my bf looking at porn or gonewild or whatever, commenting or messaging someone on those or other mediums is not okay. 

I found out fairly recently that my bf downloaded mods for a popular game that allow you to "have sex" with other characters, and that he had specifically downloaded characters, characters with certain appearances, and some characters resembling celebrities. 

When I found this out I was very upset. Maybe a bit of an overreaction, but I think that's because I saw his comments on subreddits talking about these mods and characters, and a comment that basically crossed the line for me because it was on a nsfw photo album. 

We discussed it, we cried. I reiterated my strong feelings about interaction and commenting and he apologized and said he understood. He suggested he should uninstall the game and mods.

Now he wants to reinstall the game, and had been planning on re-installing the same mods. 

We can't come to a compromise. He feels that the modding is basically porn and is therefore fair game and none of my business. I feel that the modding (and involvement with selecting new mods, new characters and involvement with the modding community) is too interactive and is something I'm not comfortable with, as I feel it crosses the boundaries of our relationship.

TL;DR: BF downloaded game mods that allow for "sex" with characters, and I'm upset because it involves interaction and commenting on nsfw content. He wants to reinstall the mods, I don't want him to. We can't agree on a compromise.

TITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 7 months, only likes to text me to talk. Driving me crazy

POST: My bf only likes to talk to me through text. I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like "Hey" "How are you what are you doing" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. 
We don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?

TL;DR: My boyfriend only likes to talk to me through text and I'm getting frustrated with the superficial conversations. I want to have deeper conversations, but he doesn't want to try anything else.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: I'm with you on this. I've been in a similar situation and it drove me crazy. It's like he's not making an effort to connect with you on a deeper level. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling? Maybe he's not aware of how you're feeling.
2. **relationshipgoals**: I think you're being a bit dramatic. Texting is a normal way to communicate in today's world. If you're not happy with the superficial conversations, maybe you should try initiating deeper conversations yourself. Don't expect him to do all the work.
3. **skeptical_sarah**: I agree with throwaway12345. It's not just about the medium of communication, it's about the quality of the conversation. If you're not getting the depth and connection you want, it's worth having a conversation with him about it. Maybe he's not aware of how you're feeling or maybe he's not willing to put in the effort.
4. **confused_couple**: I'm in a similar situation with my partner. We both prefer texting, but we make an effort to have deeper conversations when we do talk. Maybe you could try setting aside dedicated time to talk about deeper topics? It might help you feel more connected.
5. **relationship_coach**: I think this is a classic case of a mismatch in communication styles. It's not uncommon for people to have different preferences when it comes to communication. Have you considered finding a compromise? For example, you could agree to have a set time each week to talk on the phone or video chat, and then use texting for more casual conversations.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is frustrated with the superficial conversations she's having with her boyfriend via text and wants to have deeper, more intellectually stimulating conversations.
* Some commenters agree that the OP has a right to feel frustrated and suggest having an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings.
* Others suggest that the OP is being dramatic and that texting is a normal way to communicate, or that she should try initiating deeper conversations herself.
* A few commenters offer suggestions for finding a compromise, such as setting aside dedicated time to talk about deeper topics or finding a balance between texting and other forms of communication.

TITLE: For people who are atheists (r/atheism), why do you poke fun at Catholics for believing in the Catholic God?

POST: While I don't condone every negative action of the Catholic religion, I think its cruel to be mean to them. 

While I am Atheist, I can understand why some people follow religion. I don't hate or make derogatory terms to people who choose to believe in a god. 

I don't make fun of Catholics because I can understand why they believe in a religion. They want a reason to believe in life after death because death is a scary concept. A lot of people on reddit make it seem like religion is a horrible thing. While I am firm on my atheist stance, I love the fact that religion existed because it defines our history as a human race. People need religion to explain things they cannot understand or cope with. Whats wrong with not facing reality?

As an atheist, we have to accept that we are just a tiny speck in the entire universe. I think its logical to assume that people refuse to believe that because it sounds negative. Why must we poke fun at the uneducated and delusional?

TL;DR: As an atheist, I don't understand why people make fun of Catholics for believing in the Catholic God. I think it's cruel and unfair to make fun of people who are trying to find meaning in their lives.

**Comments:**

1. **u/AtheistForLife**: I agree with you. I don't think it's fair to mock people for their beliefs. I think it's important to respect people's choices, even if we don't agree with them. I don't think it's necessary to be mean or condescending to people who believe in a higher power.
2. **u/CatholicAtheist**: I'm a former Catholic and I have to say, I was never offended by people making fun of the Church or its beliefs. In fact, I think it's healthy to question and challenge our beliefs. It's how we grow and learn. I don't think it's necessary to be mean or cruel, but I do think it's important to be honest and critical.
3. **u/NonBeliever**: I don't think it's necessary to make fun of people for their beliefs, but I do think it's important to challenge them. I think it's important to encourage people to think critically and question their beliefs. I don't think it's necessary to be mean or condescending, but I do think it's important to be honest and open-minded.
4. **u/ReligiousAtheist**: I'm an atheist who was raised in a religious family. I have to say, I was never offended by people making fun of my beliefs. In fact, I think it's healthy to question and challenge our beliefs. I don't think it's necessary to be mean or cruel, but I do think it's important to be honest and open-minded. I think it's important to respect people's choices, even if we don't agree with them.

**Discussion Points:**

1. Is it fair to make fun of people for their beliefs?
2. Is it necessary to be mean or condescending to people who believe in a higher power?
3. Is it important to challenge people's beliefs, or is it better to respect their choices?
4. Is it healthy to question and challenge our beliefs, or is it better to accept them without question?

**Conclusion:**

The discussion on this post highlights the importance of respecting people's beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. While it's okay to challenge and question our beliefs, it's not necessary to be mean or condescending to people who believe in a higher power. It's important to be honest and open-minded, and to respect people's choices. Ultimately, the goal should be to encourage people to think critically and question their beliefs, rather than to mock or belittle them.

TITLE: Help me save this situation!!!

POST: Hi guys,

So this guy [21M], say Chuck, and I [23M] know this girl [21M] Gloria, let's say. Chuck and I hang out at this regular spot and so have chit-chatted and learned that Gloria has flirted with us both on separate occasions and both of us agreed that she was a helluva catch -pretty, witty, musical, etc. The way that we talked about her was in a respectful "man, I'd like to get to know her, she's really cool".

Anyways, up until yesterday, we didn't know Gloria was available. So my buddy comes up to me a few days into it and says "guess who swiped right?" It was her! Now he's not very good at starting tinder conversations, so I just up and tell him to give her my number (as a joke, but play it off). I'm thinking to myself "hell yeah I want her to have my number!" 

Anyways, he texts "Jimmy wants you to have his number 555-5555 and here's mine 555-5555" and I feel like this is still in the realm of funny. But then he goes ahead and puts "choose wisely" which I'm worried might be too dead pan. I'm initially not too worried about it because when I last saw Gloria, we had the comfort level (with each other) of cracking sex and masturbating jokes. 

I can play this off in person, but text is pretty hard. And if we scare her from coming back it might come to this. So, over tinder, unless how can he do a follow-up to reconcile this situation and/or let her see the situation as the stupid fumbling of two young dudes that it is?

TL;DR: My friend and I both have a crush on this girl, we both know her, and we both know she's into us. My friend swiped right and I gave him my number as a joke, but then he sent it to her with a "choose wisely" comment. I'm worried it might scare her off. How can he make it right and show her it's just a stupid mistake?

TITLE: My boyfriend [22/M] is a little uncomfortable with me [22/F] returning my ex's things. [dating for 4 months]

POST: Hey r/relationships, slightly petty concern ahead!

I recently told my boyfriend very candidly and openly that I needed to return my ex's stuff. My boyfriend had mentioned early on in the relationship that he was nervous about my feelings towards my ex considering I moved into this relationship just 3 months after I broke up with him. When I heard of these concerns, I immediately deleted my ex off facebook and my phone hoping I could quell his worries. He is still friends with his ex on facebook, and I have not said anything because I am trying to not let stuff like that bother me. 

He has some trust issues, and when I mentioned bringing my ex's stuff back he fell silent. I asked him if he trusted me and he said "I'll have to." I asked him how I could do it to make him feel better and he suggested I tell my ex to pick up the stuff from my place. I agreed that I would try but while I think that making him feel is my first priority, I feel a little rude for asking my ex to make the trip. 

He promised he would work on these trust issues, but when I mentioned it to him, he kindly said that although he knew what kind of person I am, knew what to expect, but I had to "build a rapport" to maintain and prove that the trust was warranted. I was a little confused because I felt like I deserve to be trusted initially, as I trust him, but perhaps we have different viewpoints.

Are his views on trusting people warranted? Am I an idiot because I trust people too easily? What else can I do to build this trust?

TL;DR: Boyfriend uncomfortable with me returning ex's things, says I need to "build a rapport" to prove trust. I feel like I deserve to be trusted initially. Am I an idiot for trusting people too easily?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think your boyfriend is being a bit unfair. You've already taken steps to distance yourself from your ex and are willing to return his stuff. That's a big step in showing you're committed to your current relationship. I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you feel. Tell him that you understand he has trust issues, but you feel like you're being judged unfairly. Maybe he's not even realizing how his words are coming across."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It sounds like your boyfriend is putting a lot of pressure on you to 'prove' yourself. Trust is something that's built over time, not something that can be demanded or earned. It's great that you're willing to return your ex's stuff, but maybe your boyfriend needs to work on his own trust issues before he can expect you to 'build a rapport' with him. Have you considered couples therapy to work through these issues?"
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit too quick to dismiss your boyfriend's concerns. Just because you trust people easily doesn't mean you're an idiot. But maybe your boyfriend has valid reasons for being cautious. Have you considered asking him what specifically makes him uncomfortable about you returning your ex's stuff? Is there something specific that's triggering his trust issues? Maybe there's a way to address those concerns and work through them together."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "I think this is a great opportunity for you and your boyfriend to have a deeper conversation about trust and intimacy. It's not about 'proving' yourself or 'building a rapport', it's about understanding each other's needs and boundaries. Encourage your boyfriend to share his feelings and concerns with you, and be open to listening and understanding. Remember, trust is a two-way street. It's not just about what you do, but also about how you communicate and work through challenges together."

TITLE: I [27f] want to propose to my boyfriend [25m] on our 5 year anniversary.

POST: Boyfriend and I have been together for almost five years (August 30th!), in the most loving and amazing relationship I think anyone could ask for. We value the same things, make each other laugh until we cry (or fart), love each other's families, share interests, and respect one another's personal time and space. I can see myself with this man in 60 years, two old farts having a laugh at our grandchildren's expense. He is my guy, and I am his gal. That's really all there is to it. Also, the sex is AMAZEBALLS.

I know he wants to marry me, but I feel like he's waiting until the "right time". Waiting until we are a little more financially stable, until blah blah blah. I think within a year or two we will be financially ready to move into a larger place and get a dog and do all that "pre-kids" marriage stuff. A nice long engagement, and we're all set.

I want to propose. Personally, I think he'd get a kick out of it. He comes from a long line of feminists. I don't think he'd say "no", and really my biggest fear is that I'd steal his thunder. I have something truly spectacular in mind, but would like Reddit's take on it before I do something crazy.

What do you think, guys? Should I go for it, or wait to see if he possibly pops the question first?

TL;DR: I want to propose to my boyfriend on our 5 year anniversary, but I'm worried about stealing his thunder and not knowing if he's ready. Should I go for it, or wait to see if he proposes first? Help! 

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Girl, you're thinking too much! If you're ready to propose, he's probably ready too. Go for it! It's a special moment, and you'll both cherish it regardless of who proposes first. Plus, it's not like you're going to'steal his thunder' - it's your relationship, and you can make your own decisions. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should wait. You mentioned he's waiting for the 'right time', and it's possible he's thinking about proposing too. Give him the chance to do it, and if he doesn't, then you can have a conversation about it. Remember, it's not about who proposes first, it's about the commitment and love you share."
3. **u/loveislove**: "I'm a guy, and I think you should propose! It's a romantic gesture, and it shows you're willing to take the leap and make a commitment. If he's not ready, he'll appreciate the thought and effort you put into it. And who knows, he might even propose back! Either way, it's a win-win."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm a little skeptical about your motivations. Are you proposing because you truly want to spend the rest of your life with this person, or are you trying to prove something to him? Make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, and not just to check a box or impress him."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and desires. Let him know that you're thinking about proposing and why, and see how he reacts. This way, you can both be on the same page and make a decision that works for both of you." 

---

**Conclusion:** The post receives a mix of opinions, with some users encouraging the OP to propose and others suggesting she wait for her boyfriend to propose first. The comments highlight the importance of considering one's motivations and having an open and honest conversation with one's partner about one's feelings and desires. Ultimately, the decision to propose or wait is a personal one that depends on the individual circumstances and values of the couple.

TITLE: Hey guys, do you know how to get a ridiculous hospital bill reduced??? Details inside.

POST: I had a bike accident and broke my wrist and separated my shoulder and some road rash. I went to the hospital where I waited 4 hours to get an x-ray. I was also given pain medication that was injected to me without telling me how much each shot would cost. They injected me about 4 times total. They also cleaned some of the road rash and put a temporary cast on me and referred me to another doctor. This cost me $1867. This seems a little unfair. I did not ask for pain meds nor was I told how much it would cost me. Do any of you know if I have something going here? Do any of you have a success story from a similar situation???

TL;DR: Got a $1867 hospital bill for a bike accident. Didn't ask for pain meds, wasn't told how much it would cost. Is this unfair? Do you have a similar story?

COMMENTS:

* "You should definitely try to negotiate with the hospital. They may be willing to reduce the bill or work out a payment plan with you. You can also try contacting the patient advocate at the hospital. They may be able to help you resolve the issue."
* "I had a similar experience and was able to get my bill reduced by 50% by negotiating with the hospital. I also asked for a breakdown of the charges and was able to identify some unnecessary expenses. Good luck!"
* "You should also consider contacting your insurance company to see if they can help you with the bill. They may be able to negotiate with the hospital on your behalf or provide additional coverage for the services you received."
* "I've heard that some hospitals have a 'charity care' program that can help reduce or eliminate medical debt for people who are uninsured or underinsured. You may want to look into that as well."
* "It's also a good idea to keep track of all your medical expenses and keep a record of any communication with the hospital or insurance company. This can help you keep track of your progress and provide evidence of any disputes you may have."

This post is an example of a common issue that many people face when dealing with medical bills. The OP is seeking advice on how to negotiate with the hospital to reduce the bill, which is a common practice. The comments offer a range of suggestions, from negotiating with the hospital directly to contacting the patient advocate or insurance company. The post also highlights the importance of keeping track of medical expenses and communication with the hospital or insurance company. Overall, the post is a good example of how the r/AskReddit community can provide helpful advice and support for people dealing with everyday problems.

POST: First, stomach cant burp almost. It wants to, but the mechanism to burp seemed fucked up. It cant burp, so I get sick, and it tries to eject everything instead. I hate eating now, since it hurts from the first few bites. And then after I eat a meal it hurts. Lots of discomfort. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. But, could that be due to saliva or something? I noticed when I throw up its...weird. Its like a blob of spit almost...could that be due to swollen tonsils? They stay big, but when I get sick, they get even bigger and hurt. I cant eat or drink for a few days. Also, my lymph nodes kinda get like a ball shape you can feel...

Anyway, that one is not so bad I guess. Ive been smoking MJ, and even with that I cant eat. But If I smoke a LOT, then I can at least eat a few bites. So, found a fix..

The sleep problem seems to be destroying me right now. I cant sleep from the time 11-2 is seems. For the last year at least. I have hypnagogia, so I play a "movie" or dream before I fall asleep fully. Ill be in the deepest thought you can ever have, and it will play automatically. Its sorta like inception. But after the movie, usually around 30 minutes, ill wake up. but lately ive been catching myself even before that. when it starts, ill think, wtf am i thinking about, and then be like, DAMN. When I finally fall asleep, i feel im not sleeping deep. Or if I do, no more than a hour. I wake up exhausted. I never get the tired feeling/sensation/chemical until the day. I take a nap, and I feel so much more rested after a few hours. But I cant take naps during the day everyday. Even if I dont nap, Ill be god damn tired all day. Then 11 comes and im fucking wide awake. Its hell. Weekend or weekday I cant sleep at night. Ive tried just about all the things they tell you to do. None work.

TL;DR: I have stomach issues, can't burp, and it hurts when I eat. I also have sleep problems, can't sleep from 11-2, and wake up exhausted. I've tried various remedies, but nothing seems to work.

TITLE: Update Me [38 M] trying to figure out if my wife [34] of 2.5 years, cheated on me in the past

POST: [Original post](

Okay I finally talked to my wife. I was really nervous and tried to set up a good opportunity. When it got as good as I though it was going to get I just said "So, did anything ever happen between you and dude?" Not the smooth delivery I had hoped to make.

She said "You mean like romantically? No, no never." She seemed very sincere, and I believed her right away.

I went on to tell her all of the reasons I was worried, and she was very understanding. She was upset that I didn't trust her.  She did start crying when I told her about my fears that our daughter might not have been mine. She was upset that I would even think that, which is what I anticipated, and one of the main reasons I waited so long to tell her.

I put her in my shoes and asked how she would feel if a female coworker of mine acted in a similar way. It seemed like she hadn't considered that, and she admitted to being jealous and insecure in the past, which made me feel better.

She made lots of reassurances that if she was ever unhappy enough in our relationship that she would think about seeing someone else, that she would let me know things were bad way before it got to that point.

It's hard to describe how you can tell someone is telling the truth, but I could really tell. Unless she is some kind of amazing liar, which I think I would have known about after 16 years.

She did defend her douchey friend's actions a little, which I was bothered by. She said he always says things like that and doesn't really mean anything by it. I still think he's just a dipshit. I told her I didn't want to hang out with him and his wife anymore. We have moved 1200 miles away from where they are now, so it doesn't really matter.

So, yeah I am the paranoid insecure jackass that I was hoping I was.

Thank you all for your thoughts and advice.

TL;DR: I suspected my wife of cheating, and after a long conversation, I believe she is telling the truth. I'm still feeling insecure and unsure if I can fully trust her.

**Comments:**

* "I'm glad you had the conversation and it seems like your wife is telling the truth. However, it's understandable that you're still feeling insecure. It might be helpful to work on building trust and communication in your relationship. Have you considered couples therapy?"
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with your wife and yourself about your feelings. It takes a lot of courage to have those kinds of conversations. It's also good that your wife is being open and honest with you. Remember that trust is something that's built over time, and it's okay to take things slow and work on rebuilding it."
* "I'm a bit surprised that your wife defended her friend's actions. That can be a red flag. It might be worth having a follow-up conversation with her about why she's defending him and what she really thinks about his behavior."
* "I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel insecure and paranoid when you're worried about something like this. It's good that you're taking the time to talk to your wife and work through your feelings. Just remember to be patient and understanding, and try not to jump to conclusions."
* "I think it's great that you're being open and honest with your wife. It's not always easy to have those kinds of conversations, but it's important for building trust and intimacy in a relationship. Just remember to be patient and understanding, and try not to be too hard on yourself or your wife."

TITLE: There's something to be said for some time off

POST: Last month (July 19th to be exact) I went for a 6 mile run and totally blew my knee. I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old "normal" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace! I only stopped because I didn't want to go from zero to 60 and risk reinjury. I feel like a million bucks!

TL;DR: Had to take 5 weeks off from running due to knee injury, used the time to focus on strength training and lost 3 pounds, increased strength and endurance, and now I'm back running faster than ever! There's something to be said for taking a break and focusing on other aspects of fitness.

COMMENTS:

* "Wow, that's amazing! I'm glad you're back running and feeling good. It's great that you were able to focus on strength training and come back even stronger. You're an inspiration!"
* "I'm so impressed! I've been dealing with a similar injury and it's hard to stay motivated when you can't do what you love. You're a great reminder that there's always something to be gained from taking a break and focusing on other aspects of fitness. Thanks for sharing your story!"
* "I'm glad you're back running and feeling good! It's great that you were able to focus on strength training and come back even stronger. You're an inspiration! I'm going to have to try some of the exercises you mentioned, thanks for sharing!"
* "I'm so glad you're back running and feeling good! It's great that you were able to focus on strength training and come back even stronger. You're an inspiration! I'm going to have to try some of the exercises you mentioned, thanks for sharing! I'm also going to have to start incorporating more strength training into my routine, thanks for the motivation!"

I'm going to have to start incorporating more strength training into my routine, thanks for the motivation!" (This comment is just a repeat of the previous ones, but with a few extra words)

The post and comments are all very positive and supportive, with many users expressing admiration for the OP's ability to adapt to their injury and come back stronger. The post also serves as a reminder that taking a break from running can be beneficial for overall fitness and that strength training can be a great way to stay active and engaged while recovering from an injury. The comments also offer words of encouragement and motivation, with many users expressing a desire to try some of the exercises mentioned in the post. Overall, the post and comments are a great example of the supportive and encouraging community that exists on r/running.

TITLE: Me [20F] with my boyfriend [27 M] of 1 year, on a break because of his lost desire for sex.

POST: We went a few days without talking at all so I finally ask him what's up. He keeps saying he can't explain it but he's sorry and that the fire is gone from the relationship. We meet up to talk about it in person and he says he lately has no sex drive, asks me why we need to have sex every time we hang out (2-3 times per week usually).

This made me feel really insecure and took my self-esteem down a notch but told him I wanted to fix it. His solution was to keep on doing everything else the same but just take a break from sex to see if that fixes things. I feel that there is an underlying issue with the relationship such as him just losing interest because we've been together for a while. So I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely and see how it feels.

On my end it feels like shit. I want to call him just to talk about our day or to say I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate to him. It gets a little easier each day so I'm wondering if I should break it off completely so there's no lingering hope of getting back together. That's the only way I see myself truly moving on.

Should I stay in a relationship where he is confused about his feelings and physically uninterested? Or should I break things off and try to move on?

TL;DR: Me and my boyfriend of 1 year are on a break due to his lost desire for sex. He says he's sorry and wants to keep doing everything else the same but take a break from sex. I feel insecure and want to fix it but I'm not sure if it's worth staying in a relationship where he's confused about his feelings and physically uninterested. Should I stay or break things off and move on?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's already checked out emotionally and physically. If he can't even be bothered to have a conversation about it, it's probably a sign that he's not invested in the relationship anymore. You deserve better than someone who's just going through the motions. Take a break, focus on yourself, and see if you can find someone who actually wants to be with you."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that he's going through a phase and it's not a reflection of his overall feelings for you. But if he's still not interested in working on the relationship or communicating with you, then it might be time to reevaluate whether this is the right relationship for you."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough spot to be in. I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own feelings. If you feel like you're still invested in the relationship and want to try to work through things, then that's okay. But if you're feeling like you're just holding on out of habit or obligation, then it might be time to let go. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."
* "I think you should take a break from him, but not necessarily break off the relationship entirely. Sometimes people just need some space to figure things out. If you're still feeling insecure and unhappy after a few weeks, then it might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is right for you. But if you're still holding on to hope that things will get better, then it might be worth giving it another shot."
* "I think you should break things off. If he's not interested in having sex with you, that's a major red flag. It's not just about the sex itself, it's about the fact that he's not even willing to try to work through it with you. You deserve someone who is willing to communicate with you and work through problems together."

TITLE: Person I'm dating (both 24[f]24[f]) broke our exclusivity rules. Worth saving?

POST: Been together approximately one month, however have not firmly spoken about the boundaries of the relationship apart from deleting dating apps and saying we weren't seeing anyone else. We decided we weren't ready to use any form of labels or terms yet

It's been going well, met each other's friends etc except today she discloses that she slept with someone approximately 1 week ago. It's someone who she previously was interested in a romantic relationship but rejected her. She stated that she was enjoying what we had etc, and she feels this person would not have a relationship with her,

At the moment I have let her cool off (she's feeling a lot of guilt, confusion) and have told her to have a think. I think I'm happy to continue if she is able to prioritise and choose me, and really work on this. This might involve having to drop contact with the person she cheated with However it feels so early to be having to work on our relationship. I feel like if she doesn't immediately know then it's not worth it

What would you do? Say? Would you even consider continuing? Under what conditions?

TL;DR: 24[f]24[f] couple, no labels, no rules, but broke exclusivity. She slept with someone 1 week ago. I'm unsure if it's worth saving. Should I give her a chance to prove herself or cut ties?

---

**Community Response:**

The community is divided on whether the OP should give the person a second chance or cut ties. Some users argue that the person's actions are a red flag and that the OP deserves better. Others suggest that the person may have been genuinely confused about the relationship and that giving them a chance to prove themselves could be worth it.

Some common themes in the responses include:

* The importance of communication and setting clear boundaries in a relationship
* The need for the person to take responsibility for their actions and prioritize the OP's feelings
* The potential for the person to learn and grow from their mistake
* The importance of considering the OP's own feelings and needs in the decision-making process

Some users also suggest that the OP should take the time to reflect on their own feelings and priorities before making a decision. For example, one user writes:

"I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want from this relationship. Are you willing to work through this and potentially rebuild trust? Or are you looking for someone who is more committed to exclusivity from the start? You deserve to know what you want and what you're willing to compromise on."

Overall, the community response is nuanced and varied, reflecting the complexity of relationships and the challenges of navigating difficult situations. Ultimately, the decision of whether to give the person a second chance or cut ties is a personal one that depends on the OP's own values, priorities, and feelings.

TITLE: Reddit, what kind of effect do you think that crime shows/movies might have in reducing the occurrence of thought-out, "intelligent" crime?

POST: I had this thought a few days ago when watching an episode of NCIS and they did the usual "create a super high resolution image from a very low resolution image." I got to wondering how much of it is real and how much of it is fake (or, conversely, how much might be under-exaggerated). Based on these types of shows/movies (bank robbery, conning, etc.) where the bad guy nearly 100% of the time gets caught, only an idiot would think it would be a good idea to do any of this stuff, and from my [limited] knowledge of the general criminal, I'm under the impression that they are mainly uneducated people in dire situations (or psychopaths/mentally unstable.. but I'm thinking mostly with regards the heist type of crime -- not assault or murder) that are driven to extreme lengths to make the "easy"/"quick" dollar. So I wondered, is it possible that these shows/movies that show the criminal, no matter how smart and creative, almost always getting caught could actually be (subconsciously or consciously) reducing the amount of more well thought through crime throughout the world?

TL;DR: Do you think crime shows/movies might actually reduce the occurrence of intelligent, well-planned crime?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: I think you're onto something here. I've noticed that a lot of the "smart" criminals on TV shows are actually just really lucky or have some kind of inside help. It's like the writers are trying to make the audience feel like "oh, wow, this guy is so clever!" but in reality, it's just not that realistic. I think it's possible that these shows could actually deter people from trying to commit crimes, especially if they're not as clever as they think they are.
2. **u/NotoriousP.I.**: I've been a detective for over 10 years, and I can tell you that the majority of crimes are committed by people who are not "smart" or "intelligent" in the classical sense. They're often driven by desperation, addiction, or a lack of education. The "smart" criminals you see on TV are usually just a small minority, and they're often caught because of their own arrogance or mistakes. I think it's possible that these shows could have a deterrent effect, but it's also important to remember that crime is a complex issue and there's no single solution.
3. **u/Redditor12345**: I'm a criminologist, and I can tell you that the impact of crime shows on crime rates is still a topic of debate. Some studies suggest that exposure to crime shows can increase empathy and understanding of criminal behavior, which could potentially reduce crime rates. On the other hand, other studies suggest that crime shows can also desensitize viewers to violence and criminal behavior, which could have the opposite effect. It's likely that the impact of crime shows on crime rates is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including the type of show, the audience, and the cultural context.
4. **u/Anonymous123456**: I'm a former con artist, and I can tell you that the portrayal of criminals on TV shows is often way off the mark. In reality, most criminals are not "smart" or "intelligent" in the classical sense. They're often just desperate people who are willing to do whatever it takes to make a quick buck. I think it's possible that these shows could have a deterrent effect, but it's also important to remember that crime is a complex issue and there's no single solution. Additionally, I think it's important to note that the portrayal of criminals on TV shows can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and stigmatize certain groups of people.
5. **u/throwaway123456789**: I think it's also worth noting that the portrayal of crime on TV shows is often sensationalized and exaggerated for the sake of entertainment. In reality, most crimes are not as exciting or dramatic as they are portrayed on TV. I think it's possible that this could have a deterrent effect, as people may be less likely to try to commit a crime if they realize that it's not as glamorous or exciting as they thought it would be. On the other hand, it's also possible that the sensationalized portrayal of crime could have the opposite effect, as it may make people more likely to try to commit a crime in order to experience the thrill and excitement of it. It's a complex issue, and I think it's important to consider both sides of the argument.

TITLE: Me [23 M] don't understand my crush [25 F] absolutely anymore

POST: So I've known this girl for almost 3 years now. We dated a little while when we met, but as soon as things started to get little bit more serious, she moved to Australia for 2 years (in my defence, she had the tickets bought before we started dating).

Now last november she came back, at that time I was at sea (working in the Navy). Since February we've been seeing each other again, been to the movies, restaurants, just hung out at each other's places etc, it's been fun. 

Couple days ago I asked her, what does she think about a relationship, to which she replied that she's not really looking for anything serious. I reluctantly agreed. Since we've known each other for some time now, I won't start ignoring her just for that, better to stay friends. 

2 days ago I had a party at my place, to which she came also. By time others fell asleep, we stayed up the whole night, drank and watched some stupid cartoons and spooned like there's no freakin tomorrow (got horrible blue balls from that). For a girl, who told she's not looking for a relationship, that was kind of odd thing to do, am I looking at "friends with benefits" kind of invitation or something? Confused af.

Sorry for long post, let there be a invisible potato.

TL;DR: Crush says she's not looking for a relationship, but we had a super intimate night together, what does it mean?

The post is well-written, with a clear and concise summary at the end. The OP is open about his feelings and is seeking honest advice from the community. The post has received many comments, with some people advising the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his crush about his feelings, while others suggest that he should respect her boundaries and focus on maintaining a friendship. The post has also sparked a discussion about the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my wife [26 F] 5 years together, Third week into our trial separtation

POST: 5 weeks ago I came home from work and my wife told me that she would be moving out in a week and a half. 

We are in the third week of her moving out. I am in our house that we bought 2 years ago and the daily reminders of her being gone are finally settling. I feel like I am the only one trying to make this relationship work right now. My heart broke when she left and I am trying to rebuild trust in her so that we can be happy if she decides to come home. 

She has been in therapy for 2 years and I just started 4 weeks ago. I am coming to many realizations and am confronting the issues that I made in our relationship. I know that now that I have seen that fear was controlling me I never want to go back to that dark place again. She tells me that she is afraid of feeling trapped in the relationship and not being able to keep her voice to ask for what she wants. 

Tonight we had a phone call. (The happen every 2-3 nights) I asked her if she was leaning to one side or the other in terms of coming home. She is against the relationship right now. She isn't working on rebuilding the relationship, she is trying to figure out if she wants the relationship at all. 

She is the most important person in my life. I love her so much and it hurts an unthinkable amount that she doesn't want to try.

How do I maintain my trust in her with her crushing my hope so heartlessly? What do I have to say to let her know that I am making so much emotional progress and positive growth?

TL;DR: My wife left me 5 weeks ago and I'm trying to rebuild trust and make our relationship work. She's in therapy and I just started, but she's not interested in working on our relationship right now. I'm trying to make progress and show her that I'm committed to change, but it's hard when she's not reciprocating. How can I maintain my trust in her and let her know that I'm making progress?

TITLE: [30 M] Can a relationship work with no chemistry?

POST: I'm kind of a unique situation... 30 years old never had a gf, never done anything sexual, just recently started online dating.  (Reason for my lack of experience is being extremely shy, low self esteem)  Reason I've started online dating is an attempt to salvage what's left of my life.. figured even though I wasted so much of my life at this point there's no reason I should just die as a lonely virgin, so i decided to at least TRY.

After about ~5 or so weeks I've met two girls so far, got at least one more to meet in the near future.  Problem is, I am a bit awkward (Ok, I am a lot awkward.)  I feel like I do not "click" with anyone, and would not really know how to flirt, etc.  Question is this: how important/real is this "chemistry" thing?  If I don't feel anything, is it possible to develop these feelings over time?

In other words, should I force the relationship forward just because I so desperately want one?  Or should I move on when I don't detect this "chemistry" thing, and have the gross audacity to actually *turn down* an attractive female when I'm a 30 year old desperate virgin?

Dating and relationships are just so alien to me and I have no idea what I'm doing or how to even interact with the opposite sex.  At times I feel I'm being irresponsible even trying, and I have no right to date anyone :/

TL;DR: 30 year old virgin, started online dating, met two girls so far, don't feel any chemistry, unsure if it's worth forcing the relationship forward or just moving on.

TITLE: TIFU By trying to have two females hook up in my backyard.

POST: So this happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the back yard, replacing a damaged sprinkler head. I dug up the old one, and removed it when I noticed that the hole was slowly filling with muddy water. It was so murky, I could not see the bottom of this 5 inch deep hole. So, I get the new sprinkler, attach a 1 inch male coupling to the bottom, and then attach another 1 inch female coupling to that, so that the new sprinkler would sit a little higher, therefore be more visible while mowing. I lower this into hole, and start twisting, hoping that it will snag onto what I had assumed was another male end at the bottom.

After doing this for about 2 or 3 minutes, I am starting to get frustrated. I reach in there to feel around, but the hole is too narrow for my grizzly-like hands. I try using towels to get the water out, to no avail. I try to widen the hole by using said water to turn dirt walls into mud, so that my hand might fit better. At this point, I am ten seconds away from making the hole larger using a shovel, and possibly having more dirt and debris fall in, when I look up at the old sprinkler head. I realize my foolishness. Attached to the bottom of it is the male coupling that I had been attempting to attach my female coupling to.

I pop off the new female coupling, sink that sprinkler in, give it a good twist, and vam, bam, boosh. Filled up the hole, and am now sitting here, glad none of my friends were around. After realizing my mistake, I had it done and said with, within 1 minute.

TL;DR: I tried to attach a female coupling to a male coupling in my backyard, and ended up filling a hole with muddy water. I then realized my mistake, and attached the correct parts, filling the hole with water.

TITLE: Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or...?

POST: R/travel, you guys have been good to me, helped my wife and I put together a killer 2 week tour de Spain, both of our first times out of the country.

Now we are looking at a 7-8 day trip in 2016, maaaybe early 2017. Weighing out what both wife and I want, ideally we could get:
  -relaxation 
  -zip lining (wife says zip lining is a must)
  -relatively easy travel from west coast (avoiding jet lag on such a short itinerary)
  -no car rental (fine w cabs/ trains/ bus)
  -if we're doing a relaxing vacation, I'd love if we could be on the beach
  -other activities: day hikes, snorkel, kayak??
  - good food/ drink hopefully!!

I was trying to figure out where to get started on a Costa Rica itinerary, when someone strongly suggested Nicaragua. Part of my downfall is trying to do too much, so help me keep it simple :). 1-2 locations over 8 days would be perfect.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Looking for a 7-8 day trip in 2016/2017, want relaxation, zip lining, beach time, day hikes, snorkeling, kayaking, and good food/drink. Considering Costa Rica or Nicaragua. Help me keep it simple!

REPLIES:

1. **Costa Rica is a great choice!** You can definitely find relaxation, zip lining, and beach time in Costa Rica. I'd recommend focusing on the Pacific coast, specifically around Tamarindo or Puerto Viejo. Both areas have plenty of options for zip lining, snorkeling, and kayaking. You can also take a day trip to the nearby national parks for some hiking. Costa Rica has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, so transportation is easy and convenient.

2. **Nicaragua is a hidden gem!** While it's not as well-known as Costa Rica, Nicaragua has a lot to offer. You can find relaxation and beach time on the Pacific coast, and the zip lining and adventure activities are just as good as in Costa Rica. Plus, Nicaragua is generally more affordable. I'd recommend focusing on the colonial town of Granada and the nearby volcanic islands. You can take a boat tour to see the active volcanoes and hot springs. Nicaragua is also known for its delicious food and drink, especially the coffee and rum.

3. **Consider a mix of both!** Why not do a combination of both Costa Rica and Nicaragua? You could spend a few days in Costa Rica and then head to Nicaragua for the rest of your trip. This way, you can experience the best of both worlds. Just make sure to plan ahead and book your transportation and accommodations in advance.

4. **Don't forget about Panama!** If you're open to considering a third option, Panama is definitely worth looking into. You can find relaxation and beach time on the Pacific coast, and the zip lining and adventure activities are just as good as in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Plus, Panama has a lot of history and culture to explore, especially in the old town of Panama City. Just keep in mind that Panama is a bit more expensive than Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

5. **Keep it simple!** Don't worry too much about planning every detail of your trip. Just focus on what you want to do and see, and then book your accommodations and transportation accordingly. You can always adjust your plans as you go along. And don't forget to leave some room for spontaneity and flexibility!

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my romantic interest [18 F] 2 weeks, not sure what to do

POST: Hello /r/relationships. I've been dating this girl for 2 weeks (only had one date, we're both in the army so it's kinda complicated), but we've known each other for two years, and been great friends for over a year. We've had a hiatus after some ugly things surfaced, but lately we got in touch, and I decided to ask her out, because I'm 18 and never actually had a girlfriend or even a date before.

So we went out and whatnot, but no touching or whatever occurred. While I'd usually be concerned she's not interested in me, knowing her personality, she's quite shy and somewhat fears touching and whatnot, so it's understandable. 

Tomorrow we're going on another date, and I was wondering if to just flow with the situation, or somewhat push forwards and ask her if she wants a more serious relationship, i.e. actually be a couple. While she shies away from contact, when you approach her with these things, she's honest and says whatever's on her mind. So I was wondering if I should or shouldn't do so - because we've been good friends for over a year, we know each other well, so is it worth bothering going on regular dates or should I just try and "force" the issue on her?

TL;DR: 18 M, 2 weeks into dating 18 F, unsure what to do. Should I just flow with the situation or push for a more serious relationship?

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: uncertainty and self-doubt in romantic relationships. The OP (original poster) is unsure whether to continue dating his romantic interest or to push for a more serious relationship. He is also concerned about her shyness and potential lack of interest.

The post is well-written and provides relevant context, including the fact that they have known each other for two years and have been friends for over a year. The OP is also aware of his own inexperience in romantic relationships, which adds to his uncertainty.

The community's response to this post is likely to be a mix of advice and support. Some users may suggest that the OP should focus on building a connection with his romantic interest and not rush into a more serious relationship. Others may advise him to be open and honest with her about his feelings and desires. The community may also offer words of encouragement and support, reminding the OP that it's normal to feel uncertain in a new relationship.

Overall, this post is a great example of the types of questions and concerns that people may have in their romantic relationships, and the supportive and helpful community that exists on the r/relationships subreddit.

TITLE: I (18m) asked her (18f) to marry me a month into the relationship, and she said yes, but...

POST: I'm (18m) roughly a month into this relationship with a girl (18f) who has turned my entire world around, and we can't get enough of each other. We go to college together and see each other all the time. We agree on every single issue that has come up in news and in society: abortion, marriage rights, how to raise kids, religion, etc, etc. We spend easily over 6 hours together a day about 5/7 days a week and have told each other things we have never told anyone else before. I have no doubt in her, nor her in I. And she did say yes to my proposal.

However, my parents, and her parents both know that we have only been together about a month now, and I am just curious how it is we should clue them in on this situation in the least freak the hell out sort of way possible... Her and I both more or less come to a blank on this. We also don't plan on getting married until 2015 when we're out of school, or at least transferring. Any help on this would be great.

TL;DR: I proposed to my girlfriend after a month of dating, and she said yes, but we're unsure how to break the news to our parents without freaking them out.

**Comments:**

* "You're 18, she's 18, and you're proposing after a month? That's insane. You're both still in college, and you're planning to get married in 2015? You need to slow down and focus on your education and personal growth before making such a huge commitment."

TITLE: Redditors: Have you been hit on by a manager that's different sexual orientation that knew you were not the same preference?  Good or bad outcomes that came from it?

POST: While in HS I worked at a theme park over several summers.  I went back one more year in college and a former supervisor had been promoted to a very high up position.  I was living close to his house and he asked if I wanted to hang out sometime.  I didn't think anything of it.  I knew he and his wife had divorced and figured he wanted to have an excuse to go to the bar.  

We had a few drinks and went back to his place for a couple more drinks as the bar closed.  He switched from beer to some heavily poured mixed drinks at a fast pace.  He began to talk about his life and got into some DEEP shit, and got emotional.  I just kept listening trying not to be a douche, thinking maybe I am helping.  Then he started saying "I haven't felt so close to anyone like this before".  I said "that's understandable, you are talking about some heavy stuff". He kept going saying " I feel like I want to hug you.  Maybe hold you if you want to sit over here".  I told him I was comfortable where I was.  He kept going and I politely got up to leave and he changed his tune quickly.  He tried to give me a hug at the door but I switch it to a handshake.  I felt bad but not much I could do.  He was ten years older, two levels higher than my boss, and most importantly I am straight.

A couple of weeks later I did something at work that would have been cause for immediate termination (one of those bureaucratic safety things where no one could have been hurt but it's just a rule).  He was in charge that day and he changed the violation to a lesser offense that allowed me to keep my job.

TL;DR: Former supervisor (different sexual orientation) hit on me after a few drinks, I politely declined and left.  A couple of weeks later, he helped me out at work when I made a mistake that could have cost me my job.

TITLE: My girlfriend [20F] and I [22M] of over 1 Year are having issues regarding differing views on Sex before marriage and living together. I really need some advice or other experiences here, please help Reddit.

POST: Essentially, my girlfriend believes in the whole Sex after Marriage and no Living together till marriage whilst I believe the opposite and after 1 Year and 2 months it's starting to get messier. 

To start off, a little back story; my girlfriend is of Christian background and I'm not, and she did tell me she didn't want sex before marriage about 4 months into the relationship. A but late, but I respect people's decisions and don't want to push them into these things. She's a Virgin, I'm not, but I thought this girl was awesome and though "fuck it, not worth breaking up just because she doesn't want sex". 

So recently, Valentine's day, I (stupidly) brought up the situation of living together and sex before marriage, I always saw sex as an important part of a relationship and a way to intimately connect with your S/O and express your love. I also feel that living together before marriage is a great test, because some people cannot stand living together even when in a relationship. My girlfriend believes all this should happen after marriage. 

A part of me feels like it's her parents who are also heavily influencing her decisions, she always brings it back to disappointing her parents with her decisions. Whilst I respect that, some times I feel her parents are controlling her indirectly. Am I wrong to think this?

So after an argument last night, my girlfriend and I came to the point of "do we break up, or wait till marriage". And I'm left here really confused and stuck. I don't want to break up but at the same time I'm so worried,confused and I feel like I'm missing something now. Have you been in this situation? Do you have any advice that can help me? What are your views....I'm at a stump and I'm scared I'll make the wrong decision.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, but we have differing views on sex before marriage and living together. She believes in waiting till marriage, while I think it's okay to do so before. We had a big argument and are considering breaking up or waiting till marriage. I'm really confused and scared of making the wrong decision.

**Reddit's Response:**

The post received over 1,000 comments, with many users sharing their own experiences and offering advice. Here are some common themes and responses:

* **Respect her boundaries**: Many users emphasized the importance of respecting your girlfriend's beliefs and boundaries, even if you don't agree with them. One user wrote, "Just because you don't agree with her views doesn't mean you have to disrespect them. You can still have a healthy and fulfilling relationship even if you don't share the same beliefs."
* **Communication is key**: Users stressed the importance of open and honest communication in relationships. One user suggested, "Have a calm and respectful conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Try to understand where she's coming from and why she feels the way she does."
* **Don't pressure her**: Some users warned against pressuring your girlfriend into doing something she's not comfortable with. One user wrote, "Don't try to change her mind or make her feel guilty for her beliefs. That's not going to work and could damage your relationship."
* **Consider counseling**: A few users suggested seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor to work through your issues. One user wrote, "A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your differences in a healthy way."
* **It's okay to disagree**: Many users acknowledged that it's okay to disagree with your partner, and that it's a normal part of any relationship. One user wrote, "You don't have to agree on everything to have a healthy and loving relationship. It's okay to have different opinions and beliefs."

Some users also shared their own experiences with similar issues, and how they worked through them. For example, one user wrote:

"I was in a similar situation with my ex. We had different views on sex and marriage, and it caused a lot of tension in our relationship. We eventually broke up, but looking back, I realize that we were both trying to change each other instead of respecting each other's boundaries. If I could go back, I would have communicated more openly and honestly with my ex, and tried to understand where they were coming from."

Overall, the Reddit community offered a range of perspectives and advice, but many users emphasized the importance of respect, communication, and understanding in relationships.

TITLE: Not sure if husband [25M] is angry at me for not being sure if I'm in love with him or not.

POST: I love my husband sometimes, but I don't love him all of the time. I may feel bad for him sometimes, and try to love him out of pity, but I know that isn't love. I just had to get that off of my chest. 

My husband knows that I loved him enough to have given my virginity to him. 

I don't like it when he guilt trips me to try to get into my pants faster when I don't feel like having sex.

Sometimes I'm not sure why I married my husband. I hope that it's not out of pity. I'm scared that if he ever finds out that I get guilt tripped easily into "love", he'll get angry that I may not love him as much as he loves me.

What should I do? I'm scared that he has already figured it out that I may never love him as much as he loves me.

TL;DR: I'm not sure if I'm in love with my husband, and I'm scared that he's going to find out and get angry.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a safe and supportive space for individuals to share their concerns and receive advice from others who have gone through similar experiences.

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and non-judgmental, with many users offering words of encouragement and advice. Some common themes that emerge include:

* The importance of honesty and communication in relationships
* The need to prioritize one's own feelings and needs
* The possibility that it's okay to not be in love with someone, and that it's not necessarily a reflection of the other person's worth

One user suggests that the OP try to have an open and honest conversation with her husband about her feelings, and to reassure him that she values their relationship and is committed to working through their issues together. Another user recommends that the OP take some time to reflect on what she wants from her relationship and what she's willing to work on to make it stronger.

Overall, this post and its comments demonstrate the value of the r/relationships community in providing a safe and supportive space for individuals to share their concerns and receive advice and guidance from others who have gone through similar experiences.

TITLE: [28]Female with this guy[31] I've been dating for 3 months. He has so many beautiful friends that are girls...Hard to not be jealous/insecure.

POST: So I've known him for a few years now, but only recently have we started dating. He's definitely someone that I care about and he hasn't given me any reason to doubt his sincerity.(so far)

BUT, the hardest thing is that he goes out dancing a lot (that's where I met him and we do that regularly) and has SO many friends that are girls. They are beautiful, smart, fun, creatures and sometimes it's just really hard to trust that he's really just interested in me only. 

His Best Friend is a girl.. that CONSTANTLY facebooks him "I love YOU!!" etc... and it's just so uncomfortable.

TL;DR: I'm dating a guy who has many beautiful friends that are girls, it's hard not to be jealous/insecure. His best friend is a girl who constantly flirts with him on Facebook.

* Perspective: Some users offer a different perspective, pointing out that it's normal for people to have many friends of the opposite sex and that it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

Overall, this post highlights the complexities of relationships and the importance of navigating feelings of jealousy and insecurity in a healthy and constructive way.

TITLE: The guy (25 male) I've (24 female) been seeing for a month went through my ipod (the photos) after I accidentally forgot it in his car, how upset should I be?

POST: I had given him the passcode the day before while I was driving so he could change the music.

Prior to this I had been very clear about having trust issues and really enjoying my privacy. He claims that if the tables had been turned and I looked through his photos he wouldn't have cared in the slightest. 

In his defense he was slightly sleep deprived...and although he apologized he thought most people he knew wouldn't react the way i was and thought I was being overly sensitive. 

For the record, there were no inappropriate pics but there were some embarrassing selfies i had taken while drunk, lol. So I'm pretty mortified and honestly that's contributing to my anger. The bottom line is that I feel it was an invasion of privacy and it says a lot about him, what do you guys think?

TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing for a month went through my iPod (photos) after I accidentally left it in his car. He claims it was an accident and he was sleep deprived, but I'm still upset and feel it was an invasion of privacy.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you have every right to be upset. Even if he didn't mean to, it's still an invasion of your privacy. You need to have a serious conversation with him about how you feel and what you're comfortable with in your relationship." (123 upvotes)
* "I'm with OP, this is a huge red flag. If he can't respect your boundaries and privacy, then he's not the right guy for you." (92 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. It's just a few photos, and he did apologize. Maybe try to talk to him about it and work through it together?" (45 upvotes)
* "I'm a guy, and even I think this is a major no-go. You need to have a serious talk with him about why this is a problem for you and what you expect from him in the future." (67 upvotes)
* "I'm surprised he didn't think it was a big deal. It's like, come on, you know how important privacy is to her! You need to have a serious conversation with him about why this is a problem and what you expect from him in the future." (58 upvotes)

**Conclusion:** The majority of commenters agree that the guy's actions were unacceptable and an invasion of privacy, and that OP has every right to be upset. Many commenters suggest that OP should have a serious conversation with him about why this is a problem and what she expects from him in the future. A few commenters take a more lenient view, suggesting that OP should try to talk to him about it and work through it together, but these comments are in the minority. Overall, the subreddit community is strongly in favor of OP's right to privacy and boundaries in her relationship.

POST: My gf of just over a year sometimes posts nude pics of herself on her Tumblr and I'm really uncomfortable with it. I feel like such a hypocrite because I was fine about us posting in r/GW, It was my idea. posting pics of yourself to anonymous strangers for shits n' giggles is fine with me, But when it's on her Tumblr it isn't really anonymous at all, it's mostly her friends, be it male or female. She isn't posting smut, It's pretty tasteful for the most part. I'm just really uncomfortable about the idea of her friends seeing her naked. Is it normal for me to not be ok with this, or am I just being stupid and jealous? How would you feel in this situation?

TL;DR: My 18-year-old girlfriend posts nude pics of herself on her Tumblr, and I'm uncomfortable with it. Is it normal for me to feel this way, or am I just being stupid and jealous?

TITLE: Don't know if (or how) I [22F] should tell my boyfriend [25M] I really don't like what he got me for Christmas.

POST: Yeah I realize it is now a long time since Christmas and this part of my dilemma, which I guess is my own fault. So for Christmas my boyfriend (of ~10 months) got me a gift certificate for a "makeover and photoshoot".  I can't really imagine doing anything much worse than spending my day having my hair and make-up done than having my photo taken for two hours. Okay, maybe a bit dramatic but I'm really not that kind of girl and my boyfriend does know that. I guess he could be hinting that he wants me to dress up a bit more but I didn't really think he cares – I think it is more likely that someone told him it was a good gift idea or something he got for an ex that they really liked.

Anyway, I pretended I liked it and hoped he would maybe forget about it and I wouldn't have to use it. But, more recently he keeps asking me when I'm going to go and if I've booked it yet. I'm all "oh yeah I'll do it soon I'm so busy at the moment", which is obviously not an excuse I can carry on forever. So my question is should tell him I don't want to go? I would feel bad because it has been a long time now that I've pretended and he probably did put quite a bit of thought in what to get me. Also what if I do tell him, what would be the best way to bring it up without sounding like an ungrateful bitch? Or should just suck it up and go? Obviously I could make it through, especially if I had a drink or something before to help me enjoy it a bit more but I really don't want to. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Got a gift certificate for a makeover and photoshoot from my boyfriend for Christmas, but I really don't want to use it. Should I tell him I don't want to go or just pretend and go through with it? How can I bring it up without sounding ungrateful?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma faced by many people in romantic relationships. The OP (original poster) is torn between being honest with their boyfriend about not wanting to use the gift certificate and not wanting to hurt their feelings or seem ungrateful. The post is a great example of how relationships can be complex and require careful communication to navigate.

The post also highlights the importance of considering the other person's feelings and perspective. The OP is worried about hurting their boyfriend's feelings and making them feel like they wasted their money. This shows that the OP is thinking about their boyfriend's emotions and is trying to find a way to be honest without causing unnecessary hurt.

The post also raises questions about the importance of honesty in relationships. Should the OP be honest with their boyfriend about not wanting to use the gift certificate, even if it means potentially hurting their feelings? Or should they just pretend to go along with it to avoid conflict? The post is a great example of how relationships require a balance between honesty and tact.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication and empathy in navigating them. It also highlights the importance of considering the other person's feelings and perspective, and finding a way to be honest without causing unnecessary hurt.

TITLE: Me [29 M] having a crush on [22 F] and I need advice

POST: Ok, So I need some advice here or just someone who tells me its gonna be OK.
I have a hard time talking about feelings and such with my IRL-friends so here goes: Im 29, been single for 2 years now (been through some hookups/one night stands and such). I met this girl a couple of months ago,we had sex on the first date,the second but not the two times we have met after that. And I havent been thinking about this girl alot but recently I have, we text and we snapchat, and im starting to feel something. Problem is she's seeing and sleeping with another guy, she's open about that and thats ok.. Ive slept around a little aswell since we are just dating,its quite casual as you would say. But im not dating/seeing anyone else but her. I dont even know how much I like this girl, she's 22, and thats too young. Anyway, recently my life's been going downhill, Im a bit lost, dont really know what job I want and such.... fuck this isnt even making much sense, I know im supposed to be cool with it, I know its casual,I know we are not exclusive. I know all this. this is eating me up!

TL;DR: 29M having a crush on 22F, we're not exclusive, she's seeing another guy, I'm feeling something, but I'm not sure if I like her, and I'm feeling lost in life.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm gonna give you some tough love. You're 29 and she's 22. That's a big age gap, and it's not just about the number of years. You're at different stages of your life, and it's gonna be hard to make it work. You're also not exclusive, and she's seeing someone else. That's not a healthy relationship. You deserve better than that. I know it's hard to see right now, but you need to take a step back and focus on yourself. Get your life together, figure out what you want, and then maybe you can re-enter the dating scene with a clear head. Don't waste your time on someone who's not ready for a real relationship.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before. It's hard to admit, but you're not really in a relationship with this girl. You're just having a casual thing with her. And honestly, it's okay to acknowledge that. You don't have to feel guilty about it. But if you're feeling something for her, maybe it's worth having a real conversation with her about what you want. Be honest with her, and see if she's on the same page. If not, then maybe it's time to move on. You deserve someone who's on the same wavelength as you.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I'm gonna give you some advice. You're 29, and you're feeling lost. That's okay. We all go through that. But you need to focus on yourself right now. Get your life together, figure out what you want, and then maybe you can re-enter the dating scene with confidence. Don't worry too much about this girl. She's 22, and she's still figuring things out. You're not going to change her, and you shouldn't try to. Just be honest with yourself and with her, and see what happens. Good luck, man.

COMMENT 4:
OP, I'm gonna say something that might sound harsh, but hear me out. You're 29, and you're still sleeping around like you're in your early 20s. That's not healthy. You need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're not going to find a real relationship if you're still acting like you're in college. You need to grow up and take responsibility for your actions. And as for this girl, she's 22, and she's still young. You're not going to change her, and you shouldn't try to. Just be honest with yourself and with her, and see what happens. Good luck, man.

COMMENT 5:

The comments on this post are a mix of advice, tough love, and understanding. Some commenters are telling the OP to focus on himself and his life, while others are acknowledging that the OP is feeling something for this girl and suggesting that he have an honest conversation with her about what he wants. Some commenters are also pointing out the age gap and the fact that the OP is not exclusive, and suggesting that he should prioritize his own well-being and find someone who is on the same wavelength as him. Overall, the comments are trying to help the OP see things more clearly and make a decision that is best for him.

TITLE: I think i fucked it up, salvage advice/confirmation of negligible potential sought

POST: My story is, (24m)i have been out of relationships and even have had literally no sex life for a while.  I met a girl(22f), who i think is awesome, and she has a boyfriend.  That isnt the problem.  I respectfully act as a platonic friend to the girl i originally had feelings for, and to a lesser degree her boyfriend.  Now, somehow or another while i was drunk and we were all hanging out at a bar one of her friends(19f) came up to me and started giving me compliments and all that, she posts on a sexual comment i made on fb later on that night, i get her number not very long after (next day, first time we talk on fb).  We have been meeting up to see eachother with other people around and she always kisses me, which i am loving.  I even got her to go see a big concert with me in a city thats 30 minutes away (she brought her friend tho, and we didnt do anything but kissing/a little dancing)  Yesterday i txted her early in the day and she said "Im in a terrible fucking mood".  I ask why, she sais its personal, so i say ok, you dont have to tell me if u dont want, as long as you still talk to me.  she sais "okies"  and i guess i may have danced around it to see if she would let anything else out.  "so what are you pregnant?" lol gawd no etc etc.   well, i finally send her a last one saying to hmu if she wants to hang/talk/wtfever.  she didnt, and instead made open facebook posts about how happy she was and shit.  

heres where i fucking blew it reddit:  seeing the fb posts i txted her "hey u up? i wanna talk to u im gettin this wierd feeling that i missed my chance or somethin..."

its 730 am.  should i just go get drunk or something and try not to think about it? cuz im kinda stewing in what closely resembles highschool style rejection.

TL;DR: I got drunk, kissed a girl who has a friend who has a boyfriend, and now I'm worried I blew it. Should I just get drunk and forget about it or is there something I can do to salvage this situation?

---

**Reddit's Response:**

* **Top comment:** "Dude, you're 24 and you're still worried about 'blowing it' like it's high school? You're an adult, take responsibility for your actions. You got drunk, made a move, and now you're getting the cold shoulder. It's not the end of the world. Move on and focus on yourself."
* **Second top comment:** "I think you're overthinking this. You had a good time with this girl, and she seemed to enjoy it too. She's not obligated to reciprocate your feelings or even talk to you again. You can't control how others react to you, so stop beating yourself up over it. Just be grateful for the experience and move on."
* **Third top comment:** "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your motivations. You got drunk, made a move on someone who's already in a relationship, and then got upset when she didn't reciprocate your feelings. That's not a healthy or respectful way to approach relationships. Take some time to reflect on why you did what you did and how you can improve your behavior in the future."

**The OP's Response:**

* **Follow-up comment:** "Thanks for the advice, guys. I think I was just really invested in this situation and didn't want to admit to myself that I might have blown it. You're right, I need to take responsibility for my actions and move on. I'll try to focus on myself and not dwell on what could've been. Thanks for the reality check!"

TITLE: How can I convert a print book to an ebook?

POST: There's a book I'd like to read that isn't available as an ebook.  I'm perfectly willing to buy a DRM-laden ebook version of this book, but it's simply not available.  I bought hard copy of this book (actually 3 books, but that's splitting hairs) but, being a techie, I'd really much rather have an ebook.  Preferably in.pdf,.doc,.rtf, or some other flexible, easy-to-use format.

There has to be some way of turning a physical book into an ebook other than individually scanning each and every page by hand.  I'm sure there's some kind of specialized machine that can do it, but I don't have one.  I'd be more than willing to pay for temporary access to such a device; maybe mail the book away, or bring it to a Kinkos-like place.  The thing is I can't manage to find any service that does this.  Maybe my google-fu is weak, but all I can find are websites and programs that convert one ebook format to another, and 1 or 2 services that are only intended for authors/copyright holders (and they make you sign a thing certifying that you are such).

TL;DR: How can I convert a print book to an ebook without scanning each page by hand?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "You can try using a book scanning service like BookScanningService.com or ScanMyBooks.com. They'll scan your book and provide you with a digital copy in various formats, including PDF, EPUB, and MOBI. Prices vary depending on the book's size and complexity, but it's usually around $10-$20 per book."
2. **u/tech_noob**: "You can also try using a smartphone app like CamScanner or Genius Scan to scan the book pages. It might take some time and effort, but it's a free and DIY solution. Just make sure to adjust the settings to get a clear scan."
3. **u/ebooklover**: "If you're looking for a more affordable option, you can try using a service like Google Books' 'Make it a book' feature. It allows you to upload a physical book and get a digital copy in EPUB format. Keep in mind that it might take some time to process, and the quality might not be perfect."
4. **u/reader123**: "I've used a service called Book2Ebook.com in the past, and they did a great job converting my print book to an ebook. They offer various formats, including PDF, EPUB, and MOBI, and their prices are reasonable. Just make sure to check their terms and conditions before sending your book."

**Subreddit Insights:**

* The post received over 200 comments, with many users sharing their own experiences and suggestions for converting print books to ebooks.
* The top comments were from users who had used book scanning services or DIY methods to convert their own print books to ebooks.
* The post sparked a discussion about the pros and cons of different ebook formats and the importance of accessibility for readers with disabilities.
* The subreddit's community guidelines emphasize the importance of respecting copyright laws and not sharing copyrighted materials without permission. However, in this case, the OP is seeking to convert a physical book they own into an ebook format, which is legal.

TITLE: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men - How do I overcome this adversity and make this pooch at least tolerate me?

POST: Been seeing this girl and it's gotten the point where we're sleeping at each others places.  She has this dog, kind of a poodle or something (not exactly sure on the breed, small, white, kind of curly hair).  She (dog) is cool in the dog park, pretty decent on a leash, but in her own dwelling, does not like men.

Dog has no history of abuse by men, but the dog does not like men.  She is pretty territorial and barks when I even get close to her closet door (where she keeps the dog when I'm around, it's a huge closet, no sketchy neglect or anything).

Getting to the point where I have to meet this small beast and make nice-nice.  What is the best way to do so?  Apparently, she nips at hands/heels and will just stare me down and growl the entire time.  Should I arrive with treats?  I've raised pups on my own and never had a problem but mostly German shepherds and Dobermans.  Never thought I'd struggle with a poodle.  

Any help or tips would be great.

TL;DR: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men.  Need help making peace with this pooch.  Any advice on how to overcome this adversity and make this dog at least tolerate me?

COMMENTS:

* "I'm a dog trainer and I've seen this before.  It's not uncommon for dogs to develop a dislike for men due to past experiences or learned behavior.  The key is to move slowly and calmly around the dog, avoid eye contact, and let her come to you.  Don't try to pet or touch her at first, just let her sniff you and get used to your presence.  You can try using treats to help her associate you with positive experiences, but make sure to do it in a calm and gentle manner."
* "I've had similar experiences with my own dog.  The key is to be patient and understanding.  Don't try to force interaction or affection on the dog, as this can make her more aggressive.  Instead, let her come to you and initiate contact.  You can also try using calming aids like pheromone diffusers or calming music to help reduce her stress levels."
* "I'm a dog owner and I've had to deal with similar issues.  The key is to establish a routine and stick to it.  For example, if you're going to visit the dog, make sure to do it at the same time every day, so the dog knows what to expect.  You can also try using positive reinforcement training to help the dog associate you with positive experiences."
* "I've worked with dogs that have similar issues and I've found that the key is to focus on building trust.  Start by letting the dog see you from a distance, then gradually increase your proximity.  Use calm and gentle movements, and avoid sudden noises or movements that might startle the dog.  You can also try using treats and toys to help the dog associate you with positive experiences."
* "I'm a dog lover and I've had to deal with similar issues.  The key is to be patient and understanding.  Don't try to force interaction or affection on the dog, as this can make her more aggressive.  Instead, let her come to you and initiate contact.  You can also try using calming aids like pheromone diffusers or calming music to help reduce her stress levels."

Overall, the comments suggest that the key to overcoming the dog's dislike for men is to move slowly and calmly, avoid eye contact, and let the dog come to you.  They also suggest using positive reinforcement training, establishing a routine, and building trust to help the dog associate you with positive experiences.  The comments also emphasize the importance of being patient and understanding, and avoiding sudden noises or movements that might startle the dog.  By following these tips, the OP may be able to overcome the dog's dislike for men and build a positive relationship with the dog.  However, it's important to remember that every dog is different, and it may take time and patience to build a relationship with this particular dog.  It's also important to communicate with the dog's owner and work together to address the dog's issues and build a positive relationship.  Ultimately, the goal is to create a safe and comfortable environment for both the dog and the OP, and to build a positive and loving relationship with the dog.  With patience, understanding, and the right approach, it's possible to overcome the dog's dislike for men and build a strong and loving bond with the dog.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my fiancée [27 F] 3 years, she proposed to me over a year ago and has been pressuring me to "counter propose" ever since.

POST: Our relationship has been great the past 3 years.  We rarely fight and we have a lot of fun together.

Backstory: over a year ago I ended up helping her with a medical issue and took her to the hospital to be treated for dehydration.  Carrying her in my arms, the whole nine yards.  She felt extreme gratitude afterwards and decided to throw tradition out the window by buying a pair of wedding rings and proposed to me, taping the whole thing using her laptop and recited a speech for me.  She liked it, so she put a ring on it.

We've been pumped about getting married ever since then, and have been waiting for her to be done with graduate school before we officially drop the money to tie the knot.

The problem is that in my mind, and from what we've been telling everyone, we are officially engaged and that she proposed to me.  She's been wanting me ever since to do a counter-proposal, where I basically propose back, and have a whole long written confession of my love for her.  Now, I obviously have no problem in doing so, but she said she feels like until I do so our engagement is "fake" (her words).

I feel like it's a bit messed up to have that sentiment.  Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I think that whatever proposal I come up with is just going to fall flat of her expectations, considering the magic of the surprise will not be there.  Not to mention, it kind of kills the mood if she is literally *asking* me to propose to her.

Am I being an asshole?

TL;DR: Fiancée proposed to me over a year ago, but now she's pressuring me to "counter propose" and says our engagement is "fake" until I do.  I feel like it's unfair and that whatever proposal I come up with won't live up to the surprise.

---

**Reddit's Response:**

* Many users agree that it's unfair to pressure the OP to "counter propose" and that the surprise proposal was a unique and special moment.
* Some users suggest that the OP should have a heart-to-heart conversation with his fiancée to express his feelings and concerns.
* A few users point out that the OP's fiancée might be feeling anxious or uncertain about their engagement, and that the "counter proposal" could be a way for her to feel more secure and committed.
* One user suggests that the OP could propose in a way that still feels special and meaningful, even if it's not a surprise.

**OP's Response:**

* OP thanks the community for their input and feedback.
* OP decides to have a conversation with his fiancée and expresses his concerns and feelings.
* OP and his fiancée have a good conversation and come to a compromise: they decide to have a small, intimate ceremony to renew their vows and make their engagement official, without the pressure of a "counter proposal".
* OP and his fiancée are happy with the outcome and feel more secure and committed to each other.

TITLE: I (27m) am dating a married woman (27f) and we've been seeing each other for four months now. I don't know what to do.

POST: I'll keep this brief. I always wanted to be married, want a family and kids, that hasn't changed. Dating has been crappy for me as I've been so focused on working since I come from a very poor family. I'm 27 now, doing well with my career (well enough for now anyways) so I have more "time" for dating.

Used Tinder for a while, had some fun flings, met a chick who was in an "open marriage" and just wanted to date. I thought it would be easy sex, went along with it. One thing led to another and now I love her, and she loves me. She admits this, but does not want to leave her husband (which was the first guy she ever dated, and according to her friends screams at her and manipulates her and is garbage, but it's her decision)

So, she doesn't want to leave him, loves me, I love her... I've been dating her for around four months now and I've been keeping it going hoping to build a bond with her and when I can have a'very' serious talk with her about things I'll have more of a potential for her to consider my words about our future.

I need some advice. What should I do here? Should I stop seeing her?

Oh, and a side note... I'm terrified this woman is my soul mate. I've been in love, dated... and never felt a connection in my life like I do with this woman. So there's that. (Sorry for broken jumbled post)

TL;DR: I'm 27, dating a married woman who loves me, but doesn't want to leave her husband. I love her, but don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're in a toxic situation. You deserve someone who is willing to leave their husband for you, not someone who is using you as a way to escape their unhappy marriage. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and get out of this situation ASAP."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "I'm not a relationship expert, but I can tell you that this situation is not healthy for anyone involved. The married woman is not being honest with herself or her husband, and you're being used as a way to avoid dealing with the problems in her marriage. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating your priorities. You deserve someone who is willing to be honest and work through issues together, not someone who is using you as a way to escape their problems."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure why you're surprised that she's not willing to leave her husband. You're not even her first affair, and she's already admitted that she doesn't want to leave him. It sounds like she's using you as a way to feel good about herself while still maintaining her comfortable life with her husband. You deserve better than that. I would suggest taking a hard look at why you're still dating her and what you're hoping to get out of this situation."
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that this situation is not healthy for anyone involved. You're in a situation where you're in love with someone who is already married, and you're not even sure if she's willing to leave her husband. That's a lot of uncertainty and stress. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating your priorities. You deserve someone who is willing to be honest and work through issues together, not someone who is using you as a way to escape their problems."
5. **LoveIsLove**: "I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that love is love, no matter what. If you're in love with this woman, then you should be with her, even if it's not the most conventional situation. However, you also need to be honest with yourself about what you're getting into. You're not going to be able to change her husband's behavior or make her leave him, so you need to be prepared for the possibility that this situation may not work out in the long run. You deserve someone who is willing to be honest and work through issues together, not someone who is using you as a way to escape their problems."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, I didn't expect such a strong reaction. I guess I was hoping for some advice on how to make this work, but it seems like most of you are saying I should just get out of this situation. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm really torn. I love this woman, and I feel like we have a deep connection. I know it's not ideal, but I'm willing to work through the issues and make it work if she is.

I guess my question is, what are some signs that she's truly committed to leaving her husband and being with me? Are there any red flags I should be looking out for? And what are some ways I can help her work through her feelings and make a decision about her future?

Thanks for the advice, guys. I'll take it into consideration."

**Additional Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, OP. If she's not willing to leave her husband, then she's not committed to you. You deserve someone who is willing to take a risk and be with you, not someone who is using you as a way to escape their unhappy marriage."

TITLE: Me(22F) with my sister(18F) and her boyfriend(17M) Should I say something?

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for a little over a year now. They are each others first relationships. 

I recently got out of a 3 year abusive relationship. My anger toward my ex might be clouding my judgement but I'm not sure. 

For a while I've been noticing dysfunctional things in their relationship that remind me of my ex. Her boyfriend is acting like a typical 17 year old boy and is really into the physical aspect of their relationship. My sister is borderline verbally abusive to him. She says things like, "I don't know why you love me, maybe you shouldn't." I feel that she treats him poorly, is rude to him and expects way too much out of him. She tells him that we, her family hates him. I've heard them talk about getting married when he turns 18 so they can have sex without getting in trouble with my conservative Christian parents. 

My sister leaves for college in the fall and I think that's creating more strain. They fight a lot more often. 

So I'm wondering, do I say something to the boyfriend? I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen, she just assumes all my words mean I hate her relationship and her. I think there's potential for mistakes, heartbreak and regrets on both their parts and I don't want that to happen. Should I talk to her boyfriend, tell him we don't hate him, we just have concerns?

TL;DR: My sister(18F) and her 17 year old boyfriend are in a dysfunctional relationship. I've noticed verbal abuse and unhealthy behavior. I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen. Should I talk to her boyfriend and express my concerns?

**Top comments:**

* "I think you should talk to your sister again and express your concerns in a non-judgmental way. It's possible she's not aware of the impact her behavior is having on her boyfriend. If that doesn't work, it might be worth having a conversation with her boyfriend as well. Just make sure to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding."
* "I think it's great that you're looking out for your sister and her boyfriend. However, it's important to remember that you can't fix their relationship or change their behavior. All you can do is express your concerns and support them in a healthy way. It's possible that they'll listen to you and make changes, but it's also possible that they won't. Either way, you've done your part and can't control the outcome."
* "I think you should talk to your sister again and express your concerns in a non-judgmental way. It's possible she's not aware of the impact her behavior is having on her boyfriend. If that doesn't work, it might be worth having a conversation with her boyfriend as well. Just make sure to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding."
* "I think it's important to remember that your sister is 18 and her boyfriend is 17. They're both adults and can make their own decisions. While it's understandable that you're concerned about their relationship, it's ultimately up to them to decide what's best for themselves. Just make sure to support them in a healthy way and let them know that you're there for them, no matter what."

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP should approach the situation with empathy and understanding.
* It's important to express concerns in a non-judgmental way and avoid being perceived as trying to fix the relationship.
* The OP should support their sister and her boyfriend in a healthy way, even if they don't listen to their concerns.
* Ultimately, the decision to stay in or leave the relationship is up to the individuals involved. The OP's role is to provide support and guidance, not to dictate what they should do.

TITLE: Reddit, I need your help with an over-protective mother.

POST: I'm 17, and recently started seeing a 20 year old. We've become extremely close, and since I met him I've been much happier and more motivated to do well in other areas of my life. I already get good grades at a difficult school, play sports, and have never had problems with drinking or drugs. Our relationship is what keeps me balanced.

My parents have been divorced for several years, and I live with my dad nearly full time. My mother is a bit over-protective, so I anticipated some difficulty, but not like this. She thinks that the age difference is too great for somebody my age, and doesn't want me to date him. This, I understand; it's her prerogative to be concerned. It can be worked around. The real problem is that she is now trying to attack my dad legally for being a bad parent, neglecting my safety, etc. On top of this, she refuses to talk to me about how we can compromise, just insists that this is in my best interest in the long run. 

I've been looking for articles about how being in a stable, loving relationship is healthy for young adults (articles seem to be the best way to get through to her), but I can't find many that address the pros of teenage relationships. What I really need is to convince her that this is a healthy thing, something that falls in line with her need to'shape me into a good young lady'.

Any ideas?

Note: "you're 17, you're too young to be dating, just enjoy life and don't feel like you need to be with somebody..." Yes, yes I know. This boy fell right out of the fucking sky, and I care about him and trust him more than almost anybody. I'm not going to give up on this just because of some age/family issues.

TL;DR: 17 year old girl dating 20 year old, over-protective mother trying to break us up, and now trying to attack dad legally. Need help convincing her that this is a healthy relationship.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, I'm 20 and I dated a 17 year old when I was 19. It was a huge mistake. I know you think you're in love, but trust me, you're not ready for the kind of emotional baggage that comes with dating someone that much older. Your mom is right to be concerned. Please reconsider this relationship and focus on your own development."
2. **concernedcitizen**: "OP, I'm not saying your mom is right, but have you considered the potential consequences of dating someone that much older? It's not just about the age difference, it's about the power dynamic and the potential for exploitation. I'm not saying your boyfriend is a bad person, but he's still an adult and you're still a minor. Please think about this carefully before making any decisions."
3. **relationshipadvice**: "OP, I'm a relationship therapist and I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about this situation. While it's great that you're in a healthy relationship, the age difference is a significant factor. Have you considered counseling with a professional to work through these issues? It might be helpful to have a neutral third party facilitate a conversation between you, your mom, and your dad to find a resolution that works for everyone."
4. **teenager**: "OP, I'm a 17 year old girl and I'm dating a 19 year old guy. We're happy, and we're making it work. I know it's not for everyone, but for us, it's what works. I'm not saying your mom is wrong to be concerned, but maybe you could try having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and your relationship. Sometimes, people just need to understand and trust their kids more."
5. **lawyer**: "OP, as a lawyer, I have to say that your mom's actions are concerning. She's trying to use legal means to control your relationship, which is not okay. You need to talk to your dad and get a lawyer to help you navigate this situation. You have the right to make your own decisions about your life and relationships, and your mom shouldn't be able to dictate what you can and can't do."

This post highlights the complexities of teenage relationships, particularly those involving a significant age gap.

The comments reflect a range of opinions, from concerns about the age difference and potential consequences to support for the OP's right to make her own decisions about her relationships. The post also raises important questions about the role of parents in their children's lives, particularly when it comes to relationships and personal decisions. Ultimately, the OP's situation highlights the need for open and honest communication between parents and children, as well as the importance of respecting each other's boundaries and decisions.

TITLE: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, but its more complex than it seems. Please help!

POST: I live with some college girlfriends in a small city in a very old home. I pay rent, utilities, (which include water, gas, heat, cable, internet, etc) and my own foodstuffs since I'm on a specific diet. I have known this girl for 5 years, and she has a boyfriend that NEVER leaves. It's not like he's a typical mid twenties burnout either - he's a teacher in a great school district, makes good money, and has his own place sans roommates less than two city blocks away. 

Basically, he is always here. Never leaves for more than his workdays and to pick up clean clothes from his place. He literally lives here, showering, cooking, doing laundry, and hanging out in the common areas even when his girlfriend isn't here. PLus, they have loud sex every night, which doesn't really bug me, but its getting a little annoying when you have early mornings and you are awoken to a slamming headboard at 2am every night...

Here is the real problem though. Many other sites that address this problem suggest that the boyfriend should chip in with rent and/or utilities. Here is the kicker - the roommate doesn't pay rent since its her fathers place. She has a joint bank account with her Dad (who is my landlord) to which she pays me the utilities that are in my name. She is a new grad and unemployed, so I know she isn't paying rent with her own money.

Myself and the third roommate are getting seriously frustrated. We both work hard at out entry level jobs to make ends meet, plus the work in maintaing the house. I basically feel like I am financing their love nest, and I'm sick of it. 

Sorry that was so long, I feel much better getting all that out.

TL;DR: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, pays no rent, and is basically living here. I feel like I'm financing their love nest. Help!

TITLE: Missing a suitable excuse to see my[20M] long distance girlfriend[20F]

POST: Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this...
So my girlfriend is in our home town at the moment and I'll be traveling there to see her. We both haven't told our parents about our relationship, we have talked about this so we're both comfortable with it. My parents would react extremely surprised and would immediately want to know everything about her and meet her the same day.

I need a car from my parents for the whole day to see her and really need an excuse firstly why I'm in town altogether and secondly why I need a car the whole day... Can you think of an excuse that might work? I still have friends there if that helps.

TL;DR: Need an excuse to see my long distance girlfriend without my parents finding out, need a reason to be in town and to use a car for the whole day.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, why don't you just tell your parents the truth? It's not like it's a bad thing to have a girlfriend.
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: I understand why you're hesitant to tell your parents, but honesty is usually the best policy. If you're worried about their reaction, maybe have a conversation with them about your concerns beforehand.
3. **carlosmendoza**: How about saying you're in town for a friend's birthday party and you need a car to get around? You could also say you're helping your friend move into a new place.
4. **throwaway123456**: I think you should reconsider not telling your parents. It's not like you're doing anything wrong. You're just being honest with yourself and your girlfriend.
5. **RelationshipAdvice**: I agree with throwaway123456. Telling your parents the truth might be the best option. It's not like you're hiding anything bad. You're just keeping your relationship private.
6. **carlosmendoza**: If you're really set on not telling your parents, you could say you're in town for a family event or a funeral. That way, you have a legitimate reason for being there and using a car.
7. **throwaway123456**: I think you should just be honest with your parents. It's not worth the stress and anxiety of keeping a secret. You're an adult, you can make your own decisions.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the suggestions, guys. I think I'll go with the birthday party excuse. I'll make sure to be careful and not slip up. I know I should probably just tell my parents the truth, but I'm just not ready for that yet. I appreciate your input and advice.

**Additional Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: I understand why you're hesitant, but remember that honesty is usually the best policy. You never know how your parents might react, and they might be more understanding than you think.
2. **carlosmendoza**: Just be careful and make sure you're not getting caught in a lie. It's not worth the risk of damaging your relationship with your parents.
3. **RelationshipAdvice**: I agree with throwaway123456. Honesty is usually the best policy, but I also understand why you might not be ready to tell your parents the truth yet. Just be careful and make sure you're not getting caught in a lie.

**Conclusion:**

The original poster received a variety of comments and suggestions from the subreddit community. Some users advised him to tell his parents the truth, while others suggested alternative excuses for being in town and using a car.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my _Friend__ [23 F] 2 years of something confusing

POST: These past couple of years I had it very rough when it came to socializing and being happy. Well, friends kinda used some drugs and I was left alone for a while I later found out...but, before that....

I started to stay away from it as I lost confidence, had low self esteem,etc. I eventually and mutually met someone. I was shy but she was outgoing so I guess it evened out somehow.Asked me alot about myself and it felt good. We were going to be meeting more often so next time....when that came she randomly came over and hugged me and introduced me to some friends. We talked for a bit,said she was a bit concerned with her apperance and then she blurts out...let me give you my number, we will get lunch soon which we did. Went well. 

I bonded with her more and more as I saw her, got a random selfie with her which was odd, but also was called sweet for a thank you I gave her. 

Now there was times she was very rude or inconsiderate. She is known by others to be immature but I look past that most of the time as she did help me out. 

The weirdest event was her kinda following me. I was going to a game with friends and invited her and her friends like a week in advance. Gave her a heads up and she said she was busy, so I left it at that. I go to the game and was walking around and look down and saw her and all her friends. Okay someone else could have had an idea to go but come on that was a bit weird that she showed up then and there when she basically said no. 

I dont want to go into too much detail to things unless needed but I didnt know if I was being played here or she liked me or it was her personality or I dont even know what. I personally grew to like her but have not seen her in a while for certain reasons.

TL;DR: I met someone 2 years ago, we bonded, but she's been very inconsiderate and immature at times. She's been following me around, and I'm not sure if she likes me or if it's just her personality. I've grown to like her, but I'm unsure of her intentions.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, it sounds like she's been playing you. She's been using you for her own entertainment, and then acting like she's doing you a favor by 'giving you her number' and 'inviting you to lunch'. The fact that she showed up to the game without telling you she was coming is a major red flag. I would cut ties with her ASAP."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "Hey there! It sounds like you're feeling confused and unsure about this situation. It's understandable, given the mixed signals you've been getting from her. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? It might help clear the air and give you a better understanding of where she stands. Just remember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and don't be afraid to set boundaries if necessary."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm with throwaway123456 on this one. It sounds like she's been using you for her own amusement, and then acting like she's doing you a favor. The fact that she didn't even bother to tell you she was coming to the game is a huge red flag. I would take a step back and re-evaluate this 'friendship' ASAP."
4. **ConfusedCaitlin**: "I'm not sure what to make of this situation. On one hand, it sounds like she's been really hurtful and inconsiderate at times. On the other hand, she did help you out when you were going through a tough time. I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she's not even aware of the impact her actions are having on you. Just be prepared to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being if necessary."
5. **ConcernedChris**: "Dude, I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate this situation. It sounds like she's been playing you, and it's not healthy for you to be in a situation where you're constantly feeling uncertain and confused. I would suggest taking some time for yourself, focusing on your own well-being, and then re-evaluating whether or not you want to continue this 'friendship'."

TITLE: Has screen-sharing been throttled on Skype and are there alternatives?

POST: Hello friends!

I am in a long distance relationship and as such Skype has been a major boon to the quality of our lives. This has been downgraded somewhat recently.

Me and my girlfriend would screen-share so we could enjoy movies and episodes together. It might not seem like much but we cherished the ability. I subscribed to the Skype service solely to keep that for us. 

Some time ago screen-sharing just stopped being able to cope with running video. I think this was around the time Microsoft acquired Skype although I'm not sure. This is confounding since both of us still enjoy good web connections and use high definition webcams that stream very well under normal conditions. 

Furthermore we have discovered that if we screen-share for any reason our call is seemingly throttled and we have to recall to regain quality.

I have googled this to no avail and I was wondering if anybody has any knowledge about this situation and/or knows a working alternative?

TL;DR: Skype screen-sharing has been throttled for us and we're looking for alternatives.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I've noticed the same issue with screen-sharing on Skype. It's really frustrating. I've tried using third-party screen-sharing software like Join.me and ScreenFlow, but they're not as seamless as Skype's built-in feature. Have you tried using Google Hangouts or Zoom instead?"
2. **u/techguru2000**: "I'm not surprised. Microsoft has been slowly killing Skype's features since they acquired it. I've seen reports of issues with screen-sharing, video quality, and even audio quality. You might want to consider switching to Discord or Google Hangouts. They're both more reliable and offer better features."
3. **u/longdistancecouple**: "I'm going through the same thing with my partner. We've tried using Join.me and ScreenFlow, but they're not as user-friendly as Skype. Have you considered using a VPN to improve your connection quality? Sometimes, a VPN can help resolve issues like this."
4. **u/techsupportguy**: "I've seen this issue before, and it's usually due to the quality of the internet connection. Try restarting your router and modem, and see if that improves the screen-sharing quality. If not, you might want to consider upgrading your internet plan or switching to a different provider."
5. **u/alternativeoptions**: "If you're looking for alternatives, you might want to consider using Appear.in or ooVoo. They're both video conferencing platforms that offer screen-sharing and are known for their reliability. I've used them with my friends and family, and they work well."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* Screen-sharing on Skype has been reported to be throttled by some users.
* Microsoft's acquisition of Skype has led to the degradation of some of its features.
* Alternative video conferencing platforms like Google Hangouts, Zoom, Discord, and Appear.in offer screen-sharing capabilities and may be worth considering.
* Improving internet connection quality through restarting routers and modems or upgrading internet plans may help resolve issues with screen-sharing.
* Third-party screen-sharing software like Join.me and ScreenFlow can be used as a workaround, but may not be as seamless as Skype's built-in feature.

TITLE: I (M20) don't know of SO (F19) of 4 years is being fair.

POST: A few months ago, we had a pretty big argument. She was upset over it, and I asked her repeatedly if there was anything that I could do to help. She said that she was fine and during the week we had tons of fun so I genuinely believed she was fine. The next few days she messaged me telling me that she's horribly sad, and that she can't believe that I let her feel sad when we were together. 
(Oh! Quick note, she lives in a college a few hours away, and comes to visit every other weekend along with her best friend.) 
Now, this isn't the first time she gas done this, this happens weekly, where she does not communicate clearly how she's feeling and what she wants me to do, then she explodes on me. 
I was furious that she would have the nerve to tell me that I didn't try to make her feel better when I had at one point begged for her to tell me how she was really feeling, so I ended things with her compulsively (over text, so a total dick move on my part). She then called me a few seconds later telling me she was sorry and that she was wrong. I told her that I made a super compulsive decision when I "ended things" and that I was sorry and didn't mean it at all. That I just acted without thinking.
Everything was fine and dandy, until recently.
 This is the problem:
Now she's telling me that she is VERY sad because I broke up with her (even after I apologized to her for doing so, and practically begged her to believe that I didn't mean it) and she says that she is feeling insecure about the relationship because I had "ended things." She wants me to make it up to her by doing this grand gesture for her as a way of showing her that I really do love her (which I do) and to make her secure of this relationship. She wants me to make her feel better. And she's very upset that I have not done it yet.

Is that fair of her? I don't understand how it could be, but maybe I'm wrong. And what can I do to solve this issue?

TL;DR: SO of 4 years has been having weekly emotional rollercoasters, not communicating clearly, and then gets upset when I don't magically know how to make her feel better. She wants me to do a grand gesture to make her feel secure in the relationship. Is this fair? What can I do?

---

**Community Response:**

Many users in the r/relationships community responded to the OP's post, offering their thoughts and advice on the situation. Here are some common themes and suggestions that emerged:

* **Communication is key:** Several users emphasized the importance of open and honest communication in relationships. They suggested that the OP and his SO need to have a more in-depth conversation about their feelings, needs, and expectations.
* **Boundary setting:** Some users encouraged the OP to set clear boundaries and expectations for his SO's behavior. They suggested that he communicate his needs and feelings in a non-accusatory way, and that he should not feel guilty for setting boundaries.
* **Emotional labor:** A few users pointed out that the OP's SO may be expecting him to do emotional labor, which is the expectation that one partner will take on emotional responsibilities for the other. They suggested that the OP should not feel obligated to do this, and that he should communicate his feelings and needs to his SO.
* **Grand gestures:** Many users were skeptical of the idea that a grand gesture would solve the issue. They suggested that the OP should focus on building a stronger, more equal relationship with his SO, rather than trying to make up for past mistakes with a single gesture.

Some specific suggestions that users offered included:

* **Have a calm, rational conversation:** One user suggested that the OP and his SO should have a calm, rational conversation about their feelings and needs. This could help them to better understand each other and find a solution that works for both of them.
* **Set clear expectations:** Another user suggested that the OP should set clear expectations for his SO's behavior, and that he should communicate these expectations in a non-accusatory way.
* **Practice empathy:** A few users encouraged the OP to practice empathy and understanding towards his SO, even if he doesn't agree with her perspective. They suggested that this could help to build a stronger, more equal relationship.
* **Seek outside help:** Some users suggested that the OP and his SO might benefit from seeking outside help, such as couples therapy, to work through their issues and build a stronger relationship.

Overall, the community response was supportive and encouraging, with many users offering practical advice and suggestions for how the OP could improve his relationship with his SO.

TITLE: [update] Gf doesn't think I put an effort into spending time with her.

POST: Ok here is an update of a post I made yesterday. 

I'm 27 and she is 28.  We've been together 2 1/2 yrs. and we live together.

Yesterday she got mad at me over the phone for not wanting to go to the beach the next day (she was on a lunch break). After we hung up she texted me and said I never try to spend time with her. I apologized and said let's go. She said she was over it and will go with friends. 

After that she texts me and says she is going out after work with friends and wont be home until late. She also said she can't go to my friends wedding next week. 

She doesn't come home  till midnight last night and when she walks in she doesn't speak to me and proceeds to watch tv in the living room and then she slept on the couch. 

In the morning I wake and she is in the bed. I try to hug her but she pushes me away and says  nothing. I fall back asleep. When I wake up again she is in the living watching tv. I say good morning and she doesn't reply back. 

Now I'm in the bedroom and she is on the couch watching tv. I don't want to fight with her but I want us to talk out the situation.

I don't know what to do reddit. Is this acceptable for a partner to be like this? Should I talk to her?

TL;DR: Gf doesn't think I put an effort into spending time with her, and now she's giving me the cold shoulder. What should I do?

TITLE: TIFU by flooding my classroom and forcing my entire class outside for 2 weeks.

POST: Okay so to start things off this didn't happen today, more like 12 years ago. 

So I went to a small country primary school in Ireland. We had maybe 200 students total, if even that and my class (6th class, highest grade in the school, we were all roughly 12) shared a room with 5th class. The school is just outside of a small town and on rare occasions the water would turn off completely. This has only happened maybe twice while I was at the school.

One day the water went, towards the end of the school day. We had PE outside at the end of the day and afterwards some of us stayed playing until we were getting picked up. I went in to get my stuff before going home and went to wash my hands. Turned the tap on but nothing came out. At this stage the school was basically empty and the teachers were gone home. I didn't notice that the plug was in the sink and didnt think to turn the tap off again as there was no water coming out.

Shoot forward to the following morning and the room is completely flooded. The room is about 90% carpet so that is completely soaked and starting to stink. Its early june at this point and while I know Irish weather gets a bad rep it was a nice summer. We had to spend the last 2 weeks of school outside (literally no there room in the school for us) and while we did do some actual work we mostly got to play. We had taken our exams for secondary school already so there was nothing to study for. 

I never told anyone it was me but I knew immediately that I had done it. I spose it worked out for me but I know it probably cost the school a good bit of money seeing as it was a small school. Principal also took the blame for it cause she used to check to make sure the taps were off to avoid this. Felt bad for her but it was pretty good for me.

TL;DR: I flooded my classroom by leaving the tap on and now I'm stuck outside for 2 weeks. 

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (That's It, F**k It) moment, where the OP (original poster) makes a careless mistake that has unintended consequences. In this case, the OP's carelessness causes a flood in their classroom, forcing the entire class to spend the last two weeks of school outside. The post is humorous and relatable, and the OP's admission of guilt and the unexpected benefits they received from the situation make it an entertaining read. The post also highlights the importance of responsibility and attention to detail, as the OP's mistake could have had more severe consequences. Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU moment that is both humorous and thought-provoking.

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 years and lived together all through their 2 years of college (canada), and my fiancee and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. We got engaged 4 months ago after living together for 1 year. My sister brought it up to me that she wanted to know if I had any problems with her getting engaged since I just got engaged, at first I told her I was happy for her and then before it happened I told her I'm mad about it because I feel like they are going to take away our moment and showing off our engagement. When I told her I was mad she apologized and said there is nothing she can really do and that she doesn't want to or plan on taking away from their our engagement, but i'm still upset and feel like they only got engaged to one up us and because we got engaged.

Am I in the wrong for being upset about it or is she being a terrible sister?

TL;DR: My sister got engaged 4 months after I did, and I'm upset because I feel like they're trying to one-up us and take away from our engagement. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in online communities: the "I'm right, you're wrong" dynamic. The OP (original poster) is upset about his sister's engagement and feels like she's trying to one-up him and his fiancée. He's seeking validation and support from the community, asking if he's in the wrong for feeling this way.

The post is likely to generate a lot of comments, some of which will be supportive and understanding, while others will be critical and dismissive. Some possible responses might include:

* "You're being ridiculous, congratulations to your sister and her fiancé!"
* "I can understand why you'd feel that way, but maybe you're just feeling a little insecure about your own engagement?"
* "Your sister didn't get engaged to one-up you, she got engaged because she's happy and in love. Try to be happy for her instead of focusing on your own feelings of inadequacy."
* "I think you're being unfair, your sister didn't do anything wrong. Maybe you're just feeling a little jealous?"

The post also highlights the importance of communication and empathy in relationships. The OP's sister apologized and tried to reassure him that she wasn't trying to one-up him, but he's still upset. This suggests that there may be underlying issues in their relationship that need to be addressed. The post could be an opportunity for the OP to reflect on his own feelings and behaviors, and to work on building a stronger and more supportive relationship with his sister.

TITLE: How do I tell my professors that I missed two weeks of class because I was going through opiate withdrawal?

POST: From sometime in October until just before school started up again two weeks ago I was hooked on pain killers. I started with morphine and eventually got to a point where I was doing almost any opiate I could get my hands on, with the notable exception of heroin. 

I made the decision to stop after the holiday break because I saw how my world was falling apart: my grades dropped, I became a farcical character in my social circles (became "that guy who's always high"), and I had a couple close calls with the police.  These, among other reasons, prompted my family to tell me how worried they were about me, so I decided I could just go cold turkey and it would not affect my studies too much.

Wrong.  I have missed almost every class since two weeks ago, with little to no contact with any professors.  The few classes I did attend I went a sweaty, detached mess of a man.  My problem now is that I need to pass these classes, preferably with decent grades.  This is my last semester and I really want to be done.  

So, I come to you, Reddit, with the hope that some one out there can point me in the right direction, so I might get my shit together. I don't really know how to approach anyone about this in person, and I'm absolutely terrified of facing my peers and my instructors. Also, to the best of knowledge there is nobody, including parents, friends, etc., that knows the full extent of my problem.

Ideas?

TL;DR: I'm a college student who went through opiate withdrawal and missed two weeks of class. I need to tell my professors and get back on track, but I'm too scared to do it in person. Help.

TITLE: 18f. Am I going insane? Are my relationship expectations too high?

POST: I hope I am posting in the right subreddit for this. Lately I have been feeling....anomalous(?) regarding what I want out of a relationship. Another fling of mine was recently ended because he 21M did not want to "marginalize his friendships." When I am in a relationship, I want a Tabula Rasa -- a complete clean slate. I don't want my significant other to be facebook friends or have any contact whatsoever with previous ex-girlfriends and/or people he has slept with. I provide the same respect. I am accepting of friends of the opposite sex as long as there is not a sexual or romantic past. It would make me uncomfortable if they were to hang out independently though, and I would prefer a group setting. 

It's as if my ideals are from another planet. All of the men I have met seem to think my relationship expectations are absolutely ludicrous. I, on the other hand, do not think it is expecting too much of a person. I am feeling lonely and as if there is something wrong with me. Am I being overbearing? I would really appreciate some objective opinions.

TL;DR: I want a complete clean slate in a relationship, no contact with previous ex-girlfriends or people I have slept with. I am feeling like my expectations are too high and that I am being overbearing. Am I insane?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think your expectations are reasonable, but it's understandable that others might find them high. It's not uncommon for people to have some level of contact with their exes or past partners, especially if they're close friends. It's not about being 'overbearing' or 'insane', it's just about having different values and boundaries. You're not alone in this, and there are likely people out there who share your views. Keep being true to yourself and don't settle for someone who doesn't respect your boundaries."
2. **RelationshipExpert**: "I think it's great that you're thinking critically about what you want in a relationship! It's okay to have high standards, and it's even more important to communicate those standards clearly with your partner. That being said, it's possible that your expectations might be a bit too rigid for some people. Consider finding someone who shares your values and boundaries, but also be open to compromise and flexibility. Remember that relationships are about growth and compromise, not about getting everything you want."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with your stance on this. While it's understandable that you might feel uncomfortable with your partner having contact with their exes or past partners, it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. In fact, having a healthy relationship with your exes can be a sign of maturity and respect. It's also important to consider that people change and grow, and it's possible that your partner's relationships with their exes or past partners might not be as significant as you think. I think it's worth having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and boundaries, but don't be too quick to dismiss someone who doesn't meet your expectations."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "Hey, I'm not a relationship expert, but I do think it's important to consider the context of your expectations. Are you coming from a place of insecurity or fear? Are you trying to protect yourself from getting hurt? It's natural to want to feel secure in a relationship, but it's also important to remember that relationships involve risk and uncertainty. Maybe try to explore why you're feeling this way and see if there are other ways to address your concerns that don't involve cutting off all contact with your partner's past. Just a thought!"

**Discussion:**

The post sparks a lively discussion about relationship expectations, boundaries, and communication. Many commenters empathize with the OP's desire for a clean slate, but also offer alternative perspectives and suggestions for compromise. Some commenters share their own experiences with similar expectations and boundaries, while others offer words of caution about the potential consequences of being too rigid in one's expectations.

The discussion highlights the importance of open and honest communication in relationships, as well as the need for flexibility and compromise. Many commenters agree that it's okay to have high standards, but also recognize that relationships involve growth and compromise. The post also raises questions about the role of insecurity and fear in shaping our expectations and boundaries, and encourages readers to explore their own motivations and desires.

Overall, the discussion is respectful and supportive, with many commenters offering words of encouragement and understanding. The OP's post serves as a catalyst for a thoughtful and nuanced conversation about relationships, boundaries, and communication.

TITLE: (M) Kinda new to having a female friend...

POST: -Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit but I figured it was a good place to start-

So I just started my college career (woo) and one thing I'm not sure about is female friends. I had friends who were girls in high school, but all of my REALLY close friends were guys. I'm on a co-ed floor, and I'm getting pretty close to a girl who lives near me. I have a girlfriend (goes to a different school) and she knows that, so she knows that I'm not interested in more than a friendship (I would hope), but I'm really interested in being close friends. However I'm not really sure what I can/can't do with a close friend who happens to be a girl... Like if I went to get food with a close guy friend or took a bus from campus to a store to get something with a guy friend it wouldn't be weird, but are there some things you don't do with a friend who's a girl that you'd do with a friend who's a guy?
Thanks for the help, I don't wanna like lead her on or something that would ruin a friendship because I really would like to be friends with her.

TL;DR: New college student, trying to make close female friends, but unsure what I can/can't do with a close female friend. Want to avoid leading her on or ruining a potential friendship.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, congrats on taking the initiative to make new friends! It's totally normal to feel unsure about what to do with a close female friend. Here's a general rule of thumb: treat her like you would a close guy friend. If you wouldn't do something with a guy friend, don't do it with a girl friend. For example, if you wouldn't go on a romantic dinner with a guy friend, don't go on a romantic dinner with a girl friend. Just be respectful, considerate, and communicate openly with her about your intentions. And hey, if you're unsure about something, just ask her how she feels about it! She'll likely appreciate your honesty and willingness to listen."
2. **u/awkwardpenguin**: "I think it's great that you're thinking about this beforehand! It's always better to be mindful of boundaries and avoid any potential misunderstandings. One thing to keep in mind is that even if you're not interested in a romantic relationship with her, she might still have feelings for you. So, be respectful of her emotions and don't lead her on. If you're unsure about something, just ask her how she feels about it. And hey, if you do end up becoming close friends, that's awesome! Just remember to prioritize mutual respect and communication in your friendship."
3. **u/sassy_sarah**: "OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, be respectful, and communicate openly with your friend. If she's comfortable with you doing something, then do it. If not, respect her boundaries. And hey, if you're unsure about something, just ask her! She'll likely appreciate your honesty and willingness to listen. And remember, it's okay to make mistakes – just apologize and move forward. Good luck, and I hope you and your friend have a great time getting to know each other!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I feel a lot better now. I think I was just worried about doing something that would be misinterpreted or make things weird between us. But you're all right, just being respectful and communicating openly is key. And yeah, I'll definitely ask her how she feels about things if I'm unsure. Thanks again for the help, and I'll keep you all updated on how things go!"

TITLE: So I have this friend...[M]

POST: One of my best friends, lets call him Greg, has a routine. Once he meets someone he wants to be friends with he ditches all his current friends and becomes best friends with the new guy. 

After about a month, Greg comes back to his old friends with the new friend and integrates him in to our little group. Everything is great; everybody is friends. 

But after a while, Greg stops being as close with new friend in order to make the new friend, say Allen, feel like he messed up and lost his chance to be friends with Greg. Allen is mad and acts like a dick to Greg and Greg does it back. After a while, Allen decides to stop being friends with Greg, but that would mean losing all his new friends who he met through Greg, who he likes better than Greg anyway.

Unfortunately, all of Greg's friends are on Greg's side because he put them though the "best friend" routine too and they have turned in to his brown-nosing army. 

Allen can either apologize and keep his friends, but be caught in Greg's manipulative trap again, leading to the same outcome or stop being friends with all of them.

What should Allen do?

TL;DR: Friend Greg ditches old friends to be best friends with new guy, then makes new guy feel like he lost his chance to be friends with Greg. New guy is stuck between apologizing and losing his new friends or stopping being friends with Greg and losing everything.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* "Allen should just stop being friends with Greg and his friends. It's not worth the drama and manipulation. He deserves better." (u/throwaway1234567)
* "Allen should try to have an open and honest conversation with Greg about how he's feeling. Maybe Greg doesn't realize the impact his actions are having on others." (u/ConcernedCitizen)
* "Allen should just apologize and move on. It's not worth the stress and drama. He can always find new friends who don't play games like Greg does." (u/NoDramaHere)
* "Allen should try to gather evidence of Greg's manipulation and present it to his friends. Maybe they'll see the truth and stop enabling Greg's behavior." (u/TruthSeeker)
* "Allen should just block Greg and his friends on social media and move on with his life. It's not worth the emotional labor." (u/NoMoreDrama)

**ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:**

* "I've seen this behavior before in my ex. It's a classic manipulation tactic. Allen should get out while he still can." (u/Experienced)
* "I think Allen should try to have a group conversation with Greg and his friends. Maybe they'll see the harm they're causing and change their behavior." (u/GroupTherapy)
* "Allen should just focus on building genuine relationships with people who don't play games like Greg does. It's not worth the stress and drama." (u/GenuineConnections)
* "I think Allen should try to find a mediator, like a mutual friend or a counselor, to help him and Greg work through their issues." (u/Mediator)
* "Allen should just take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities. Is being friends with Greg really worth the drama and manipulation?" (u/Priorities)

TITLE: My (27m) relationship questions!

POST: Hi reddit. I have been doing a lot of self reflection lately, having just come out of a 1.5yr relationship 2 months ago. 

There's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. 

I had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. 

It's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. 

Can anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships. Any more info needed or questions I'll be  sure to answer! Thanks

TL;DR: I had a 1.5yr relationship where I became extremely attached and anxious when my partner was away. I felt like she wasn't interested in me and did things to make her jealous. I had low self-esteem and felt like she kept me at an arms length. I'm trying to figure out what happened and how to avoid this in future relationships.

ANALYSIS:

The OP (original poster) is struggling to understand why he became so attached and anxious in his previous relationship. He feels like he lost his sense of self and became overly dependent on his partner. He's trying to identify what happened and how to avoid this in future relationships.

The OP's behavior in the relationship is concerning. He became extremely attached and anxious when his partner was away, which is a sign of codependency. He also did things to make his partner jealous, which is a manipulative behavior. He felt like his partner wasn't interested in him and that she was keeping him at an arms length, which is a sign of emotional unavailability.

The OP's low self-esteem and feelings of insecurity are also concerning. He felt like he needed to do things to make his partner jealous in order to feel valued and loved. This is a sign of a lack of self-worth and a need for external validation.

The OP's comparison to his previous relationship is also telling. He says that he loved when his ex was away and that he missed her, but it wasn't crippling and playing on his mind all the time. This suggests that he was able to maintain his sense of self and independence in that relationship.

The OP's questions are:

* What happened in my previous relationship that made me become so attached and anxious?

TITLE: Me [19M] and my ex gf [18F] have just broken up and I need some reassurance

POST: Will start with a little back story:

I had been with my gf for a little over a year, and it has honestly been one of the happiest years of my life. My gf adored me and made me so happy. I moved away to university in September whilst my gf stayed at home and we've seen each other semi-regularly since I've been away.

Since I moved away however it has felt different. Don't get me wrong, the amount I love and cared for her hasn't changed, but I have been beginning to feel that I am not ready for a serious relationship at my age. There are many things that I would like to do whilst I am still young that I couldn't do with a serious gf and I was beginning to not be able to be the bf I wanted to be for her because my heart wasn't 100% in it. It had gotten to the stage where I just knew I had to end it because I was, and have been for a while, staying with her to avoid upsetting her, as opposed to it being what I truly wanted which are not the right reasons to be in a relationship.

I know that my gf is completely crushed. She straight away blocked me on social networks and now I am scared she will never talk to me again. I know I have really hurt her, but I want nothing more than to remain friends with her eventually, but the hurt I know I have caused kills me inside, even though I feel I have made the right decision because I wanted it to end on good terms (well terms that weren't fighting terribly etc.), I still feel like shit because of what I know I have done to her.

I am just looking for some reassurance that my gf will be okay from people that have maybe been in similar situations themselves, because right now I feel like a terrible person and it's horrible.

Sorry if this message isn't the best written, but thank you for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR: Broke up with my 18F gf after a year because I realized I wasn't ready for a serious relationship and I didn't want to hold her back. I know I've hurt her and I'm scared she'll never talk to me again. I want to remain friends with her eventually, but I'm feeling terrible about what I've done.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you did the right thing. You're 19 and you're in university, you're supposed to be figuring out who you are and what you want. You can't stay in a relationship just because you feel guilty or because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. You're not a bad person for recognizing that you're not ready for a serious relationship. Your ex will get over it, and who knows, maybe she'll even realize that you were right and that you did her a favor by ending it before things got worse."
* "I went through something similar a few years ago. I ended up staying in a relationship for way too long because I didn't want to hurt my partner's feelings. But in the end, it was a huge mistake. I was miserable and so was my partner. You're doing the right thing by being honest with yourself and with your partner. It's okay to admit that you're not ready for a serious relationship. It's better to be honest and upfront than to stay in a relationship that's not working for you."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling terrible about this. But honestly, you did the right thing. You're young and you're still figuring out who you are and what you want. You can't stay in a relationship just because you feel guilty or because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. You're not a bad person for recognizing that you're not ready for a serious relationship. Your ex will get over it, and who knows, maybe she'll even realize that you were right and that you did her a favor by ending it before things got worse."
* "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, breaking up with someone is never easy. But you did the right thing.

TITLE: Should I [22f] break up with my long distance boyfriend [26m] before or after Valentine's?

POST: We've been dating for a little less than a year, on and off, and have been FWB for two.  Have broken up once before, got back together at Thanksgiving.  We don't have plans to see each other on V-day - he'll be working all day, and lives a 12 hour drive away, and I have to work this weekend.  I told him I would drive up next weekend, and he is planning our "V-day" already.  I am certain that I want to end the relationship; however, he does genuinely care about me/love me and I want to minimize the damage.  Would it be better to get it out of the way now, via Skype, or should I drive up next weekend and then tell him? I'm worried that it will be worse if I come up, he's planned a great V-day event, and I ruin his weekend.  Is it a dick move to end it via skype?  I know the timing is terrible, but I really don't want to hold out, miserably, for another month just because of a Hallmark holiday.

TL;DR: Long distance relationship, been together a year, want to end it, but don't want to ruin his Valentine's Day. Should I break up with him via Skype now or wait until next weekend when I visit?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, I think it's better to have the conversation in person. Even if it's not the most ideal timing, it's better to be honest and direct with someone you care about. Skype can come across as impersonal and distant, and it might make it harder for him to process the breakup. If you're worried about ruining his V-day, you could try to make it a little more special by doing something thoughtful beforehand, like sending a small gift or writing a heartfelt letter. Then, when you talk to him, you can be honest about your feelings and reasons for ending the relationship."
* "I agree with the previous comment. Breaking up with someone in person is always better, even if it's not the most ideal timing. It shows that you're willing to be vulnerable and have a real conversation with them. Skype can come across as cowardly and avoidant. If you're worried about ruining his V-day, you could try to make it a little more special by doing something thoughtful beforehand, like sending a small gift or writing a heartfelt letter. Then, when you talk to him, you can be honest about your feelings and reasons for ending the relationship."
* "I think it's better to break up with him via Skype. You've already broken up with him once before, and he knows that you're not afraid to have tough conversations. If you wait until next weekend, you might be putting him through unnecessary emotional distress. Plus, if you break up with him via Skype, you can avoid the awkwardness of having to see him in person and potentially run into each other in the future. Just be honest and direct with him, and make sure to listen to his feelings and concerns."
* "I think it's a dick move to break up with him via Skype. You're already in a long distance relationship, and it's hard enough to maintain a connection without adding the stress of a breakup. If you're going to end the relationship, do it in person or over the phone. It's better to be honest and direct with someone you care about, even if it's not the most ideal timing. Skype can come across as impersonal and distant, and it might make it harder for him to process the breakup. If you're worried about ruining his V-day, you could try to make it a little more special by doing something thoughtful beforehand, like sending a small gift or writing a heartfelt letter.

TITLE: So...the month of December was pretty much a giant middle finger to my progress so far. Time to pick up where I left off!

POST: This is my first post here so I'll fill you in on my story so far:

5'10", male, 23 years old, currently 173 lbs (in the normal range, but I've still got more fat to lose to reach my goal).

At my heaviest I was 235 (in 2008) which I slowly brought down to 200 by July of 2011. From August to November I got more serious with my diet and exercise and got down to 165.

Then came December:

Final exam season hit, and along with it came copious amounts of coffee, energy drinks, and general bad eating habits as well as lack of exercise. However, I was alright with relaxing my diet as I was stressed about exams enough already.

Then exams finished and I went home for Christmas, where my mom had a fridge full of terribly delicious foods and snacks. Chocolates and candy were everywhere for guests (and me, apparently.) 

Combine that with seeing friends from home and drinking every other night, eating out most of those nights (and not making sensible choices, no less!), plus Christmas parties, Christmas dinner, New Years Eve party, etc. 

Long story short, 8 pounds gained. In one freakin month!

That's pretty much a whole month's progress. Gone. Not to mention the wasted month that I could have used to lose ANOTHER 8 pounds. I'm so frustrated with myself that I let it get that bad.

But I've now moved back to my place, where I have control over my grocery list, and I'm getting back on track. The chicken and vegetables are back on my list of staple foods, and its goodbye to all the sugary, processed, or deep-fried garbage that I inhaled last month. 

Thanks for being here loseit! You guys are what make it possible to say no to my previously unhealthy lifestyle and strive for a better life :) Wish me luck!

TL;DR: Gained 8 pounds in one month due to poor eating habits and lack of exercise during exam season and holiday celebrations. Back on track now and looking to get back on the right path. Help!

TITLE: TIFU: By looking at my GPS.

POST: So I was driving to Upstate NY to help my SO move some of her deceased grandmother's possessions home. I had just driven from CA to VA without an incident. I was 13 minutes from my destination. A police officer was passing me as I looked at my GPS, which is on my phone, which was resting on my knee. He pulls me over. Mind you I was going the exact speed limit in the right most lane. 

Turns out that in the state of NY, I dont live there and I have obonly been there like 2 times prior, that driving while holding an electronic device of any type is illegal. So he takes my license and does a check in his car. It takes forever for him to do the lookup. While he was doing the lookup another officer pulls in behind him.

I have watched cops before. It is never a good sign when backup arrives. I am thinking that I have some hidden parking ticket or warrant. Great I think,  as I soil my pants just a little. The officer comes back up to my window. He hands me my license and apologizes that he is force to give me a ticket. He is nice enough to give me the DA's number and lets me use his pen, so long as I dont stab him in the neck with it. I asked if it would get me out of the ticket, had I stabbed him in the neck. He said no. 

I thanked the officer and asked if I were allowed to drive while holding printed instructions. He informed me thst in NY, at least, I could be drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette, eating breakfast, and read the Sunday paper. I just needed to keep one hand on the wheel. I thanked him and went on my way.

TL;DR: I got a ticket for holding my GPS while driving in NY. I was going the speed limit and didn't even realize it was illegal. I was so nervous that I almost soiled my pants. I learned that in NY, you can do pretty much anything except hold an electronic device while driving. 

EDITS: I added a few more details and a TL;DR. I also added a few more details about the officers. I also added a few more details about the ticket.

TITLE: why do people not acknowledge other people when passing by?

POST: I was going to the store today, and i just happened to pass by woman who was a little above average in looks, and height, nothing really special about her. I have a habit of making eye contact and smiling to most people I cross paths with just because its nice, and theres no harm in smiling. Anyway, as soon as we made eye contact she immediately her head down, and looked away, but as soon as we passed she put her head back up again and continued as if nothing happened. This has happened to me a lot before, but for some reason today it really struck and bothered me. So Reddit, what is your take on why people do this?

TL;DR: Why do people not acknowledge others when passing by, even when it's just a simple smile or eye contact?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think it's because people are often too caught up in their own thoughts and worries to acknowledge others. They're not being rude, they're just not present in the moment. It's not about you, it's about them being in their own world."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "I think it's because people are afraid of being judged or rejected. They're worried that if they smile or make eye contact, you'll think they're weird or try to talk to them. It's a fear of being 'othered'."
3. **OptimisticOllie**: "I think it's because people are just not used to being acknowledged themselves. They're so used to being ignored or dismissed that they don't know how to respond when someone actually acknowledges them. It's like they're not sure what to do with themselves."
4. **CynicalChris**: "I think it's because people are just plain rude and don't care about anyone else's feelings. They're too busy thinking about themselves to bother with anyone else."
5. **EmpatheticEmily**: "I think it's because people are often struggling with their own insecurities and are too self-conscious to acknowledge others. They're worried about being seen as imperfect or flawed, so they hide behind their own insecurities."

**Discussion:**

The post sparks a lively discussion about the reasons behind people's lack of acknowledgement when passing by others. Many commenters share their own experiences and theories, ranging from people being too caught up in their own thoughts to being afraid of being judged or rejected. Some commenters also share their own struggles with self-consciousness and insecurities, which can make it difficult for them to acknowledge others.

The discussion is filled with empathy and understanding, with many commenters acknowledging that people's behaviors can be complex and multifaceted. Some commenters also share their own strategies for overcoming their own insecurities and building connections with others.

Overall, the post and its comments highlight the importance of empathy and understanding in our interactions with others. By acknowledging and validating each other's experiences, we can build stronger, more meaningful connections and create a more compassionate and inclusive community.

TITLE: My girlfriend [17 F] of 4 months told me [19 M] her education is more of a priority than our relationship.

POST: The day before she said this, she was at my house and I was complaining about how she never does anything when we're alone together, she always waits for me to do something. She doesn't touch me ever and she doesn't ever make a move. I need my physical stimuli haha! 

Anyways, that day I just felt so alone. She would literally stare into blank space instead of looking at me. She wouldn't acknowledge me stroking her leg or anything. All she wanted to do was play mariokart it seemed like. When I started complaining, she said that sometimes she feels like she doesn't know me and that she feels like we have way different takes on how a relationship should be. 

She had to go home and we didn't finish the conversation, but I told her we need to talk about this face to face and not over messaging and she said okay. The problem with that is, she never has any time to talk face to face because she is in color guard at her school, but I was willing to wait until she did have time.

The next day, I tried talking to her over messaging, not about anything just a "Hey, How was your day?" and she blew me off. She said she had too much homework so she couldn't talk to me. I said, "Okay, sorry, but real quick, can I pick you up from school tomorrow?" and she said, "I have things I need to do tomorrow, sorry".

I said, "What about our relationship though? We really need to talk." and that's where she said, "grades go out Friday, my education and eligibility for color guard are more of a priority right now".

I haven't talked to her since then. Should I give her some space? What should I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 4 months says education is more of a priority than our relationship. I feel like she's blowing me off and not making time for us. Should I give her space or try to talk to her again?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Give her space. It sounds like she's not prioritizing your relationship and is more focused on her own goals. You deserve better than someone who doesn't make time for you."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's not uncommon for people to prioritize their education, especially at a young age. However, it's also important for her to make time for you and your relationship. You should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you value your relationship and need more attention and effort from her."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit dramatic. She's 17, you're 19. You're both young and still figuring things out. Give her some space and let her focus on her education. You can always re-evaluate your relationship later."
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. If she's not making time for you and prioritizing your relationship, then maybe it's not meant to be. You deserve someone who values and prioritizes you."
5. **u/communicationiskey**: "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you value your relationship and need more attention and effort from her. It's possible that she's not even realizing how her actions are affecting you. Try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments! I think I'm going to take a step back and re-evaluate my relationship. I feel like I've been trying to make it work for a while now, but it seems like she's not putting in the effort. I deserve someone who values and prioritizes me. I'm going to focus on myself and my own goals for now. Thanks for the advice!"

TITLE: Me [18 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] one year, I am paying for a vacation that turned out to be more expensive than I thought.

POST: I have been with my fantastic boyfriend for one year. He is amazing, I am pretty sure I love him even though I have not told him yet. Months ago I bought tickets for my friend and I to go to portland in August because they were so cheap. Turns out my friend can't get the time off and the tickets are non-refundable so I ask my boyfriend if he would wanna go and I say I'll pay for his plane ticket. He says he "would love to go with me". Well my boyfriend doesn't have a job right now so I feel bad making him pay for half the hotel room, I tell him I will pay for the hotel room all three nights without thinking. Now things are going to cost me at least $850. I just keep thinking he has not told me he loves me either, for some reason I just can't stop thinking about the fact he probably would not spend $850 on me. I feel like a fool for spending so much on him. I am worried I am going to start resenting him over this. I don't even know how to approach the situation or what I want my end game to be.

TL;DR: I bought tickets to portland for my friend and I, but they can't go. I asked my boyfriend to go instead and I'm paying for his plane ticket and the hotel room. Now I'm realizing it's going to cost me $850 and I'm worried I'm going to resent him for not contributing. I don't know how to approach this or what I want to happen.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're overthinking this. Your boyfriend said he'd love to go with you, and you're paying for his ticket and hotel. That's a generous gesture. Maybe he's just not used to being treated to nice things because he's not working right now. Try not to read too much into it and just enjoy the trip with him. You can always have a conversation with him about it if you're feeling uncomfortable, but I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being a bit unfair to your boyfriend. You're the one who decided to spend $850 on him, not him. If you're feeling resentful, maybe you should have a conversation with him about it and see how he feels. It's possible he's just as excited to go on this trip with you as you are. Don't assume he's not going to contribute just because he doesn't have a job right now. Maybe he'll surprise you and offer to pay for something else on the trip."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on this trip. It's just a vacation, not a test of your boyfriend's love for you. You're paying for his ticket and hotel, that's a nice gesture. Don't make it into something it's not. Just relax and enjoy the trip with him. If you're feeling resentful, maybe you should take a step back and re-evaluate your expectations of your relationship."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're feeling a bit insecure about your boyfriend not telling you he loves you yet. That's okay, it's normal to feel that way. But don't make this trip into a way to prove his love for you. It's just a vacation, and you're paying for it. Try not to read too much into it and just enjoy the time with him. If you're feeling uncomfortable, maybe you should have a conversation with him about your feelings and see how he responds."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are generally supportive and encouraging, with some people suggesting that OP is overthinking the situation and others advising her to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings. The overall tone is one of understanding and empathy, with many commenters acknowledging that relationships can be complex and that it's normal to feel insecure or uncertain at times. Ultimately, the comments suggest that OP should try to relax and enjoy the trip with her boyfriend, rather than making it into a way to prove his love for her.

TITLE: I'm [18M] going to a party where an old middle school crush [17F] is also going.

POST: Story time! Back in the summer after 8th grade, I hung out with my group of friends everyday for the whole summer. There was this girl in the group and I really liked her. Like I had the biggest and dumbest crush on her. I was only 13 so I didn't know shit, but I was thinking she's perfect for me, I gotta marry her and all this dumb stuff. The puppy love was so strong I wanted to be a part of her life and I wanted her to be a part of my life. I never had the courage to ask her out, and we went to different high schools. Eventually we stopped talking but during high school I never really liked anyone else. Every other girl felt dull compared to her. I still get nostalgic thinking about her and what would've been different if I had the balls to ask her out. Anyway I'm going to a party this Friday and I heard she's coming. I honestly don't know what to do to so this goes great and eventually ends up in a relationship.

TL;DR: I'm going to a party where an old middle school crush is going and I'm freaking out. I never asked her out back then and I still have feelings for her. What do I do to make this go well and maybe end up in a relationship?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're 18 now. You're not 13 anymore. You can actually talk to her now. Just be yourself, have a good time, and see where things go. Don't overthink it too much."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on this. Just go to the party, have fun, and see if you guys click. If it doesn't work out, it's not the end of the world. You're not going to regret not asking her out back then, but you might regret not taking a chance now."
3. **PartyAnimal**: "Dude, you're going to a party! Just relax, have a few drinks, and enjoy yourself. If she's there, great! If not, there will be plenty of other people to hang out with. Don't stress too much about it."
4. **SarcasticSally**: "Oh boy, you're really going to regret not asking her out back then, aren't you? Just kidding, sort of. Seriously though, just be yourself and see what happens. Don't overthink it too much."
5. **CautiousChris**: "I think you should be careful about this. You're still young and you don't know what you want. Take your time, get to know her again, and see if you're compatible. Don't rush into anything."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'm just going to take a deep breath and be myself. I'm not going to overthink it too much and just enjoy the party. If she's there, great! If not, I'll still have a good time. Thanks for the reassurance!"

TITLE: Apparently I want to sleep with my two best girl friends who I can never touch.

POST: Sorry, title sounded a little awkward but I guess it makes sense. So basically the other night the girl I've been sleeping with (call her F) regularly comes over and stays over, we have sex and then pass out before we have class the next day.

I have a really hard time sleeping, especially staying asleep, and so a lot of times I'll wake up, but F is a really sound sleeper and it never really bothers her. I remember waking up at least twice, and both times F was snuggled next to me, her head on my chest, but when I looked at her, it wasn't her. 

I'm in a fraternity and so we have sweethearts who are some of our best friends, but one of the things is that we absolutely CANNOT sleep with them or have sexual or romantic intimacy, since that would put the relationship between the girl and the entire chapter at risk. BUT, both times I woke up, I saw a different girl. Two of our sweethearts (call them S and B) both have a lot of physical similarities to F, all short brunettes who are cute, and so somewhere along the line of waking up I saw first B, then S, instead of F when I woke up. 

I loved it. I like F a lot, but we're just keeping things casual so we're not in a serious relationship or anything, but I spend so much time around S and B as friends, with no romantic or sexual stuff between us (except one time with S before she was a sweetheart). But, I can't act on the feelings I have towards either one, which is that some days I feel as though I might be in love with one or two of my best friends, and that maybe the girl that would be perfect for me is standing right there, and I can't do anything about it.

I just wanted to tell someone this, because obviously if I tell any of my brothers/other sweethearts shit might hit the fan and people would look at me differently.

TL;DR: I'm in a frat and I have feelings for two of my best friends, but we're not allowed to sleep with them, and I'm stuck in this limbo where I can't act on my feelings.

---

This post is a great example of the complexities of human emotions and the challenges of navigating relationships, especially in a context where there are social norms and expectations that can make it difficult to express oneself honestly. The OP is struggling with feelings for two of their best friends, but is aware that pursuing a romantic relationship with them would be against the rules of their fraternity and could damage their relationships with their friends.

The OP is also grappling with the fact that they are already in a casual relationship with someone else, F, but are not in a serious relationship with her and are not sure if they are truly compatible. This adds an extra layer of complexity to their emotions, as they are torn between their feelings for F and their feelings for their friends.

The post is a great example of the importance of honesty and self-reflection in navigating relationships. The OP is seeking a safe space to express their feelings and thoughts, and is willing to take the risk of being judged or misunderstood in order to be honest with themselves and others. This kind of honesty and vulnerability can be incredibly powerful in helping people to work through their emotions and find a sense of clarity and direction.

The post also highlights the challenges of navigating relationships in a social context where there are rules and expectations that can make it difficult to express oneself honestly. The OP is aware that their feelings for their friends are not reciprocated, and that pursuing a romantic relationship with them would be against the rules of their fraternity. This adds an extra layer of complexity to their emotions, as they are torn between their feelings for their friends and their awareness of the rules and expectations that govern their relationships.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities of human emotions and the challenges of navigating relationships. It highlights the importance of honesty and self-reflection in working through one's emotions, and the challenges of navigating relationships in a social context where there are rules and expectations that can make it difficult to express oneself honestly.

TITLE: I [28F] want to do something nice for my boyfriend [26M].

POST: I've been a real pill this semester, cause my stress levels have been through the roof with schoolwork. My boyfriend has been nothing but amazing: giving me time to study when I need it, helping me figure something out when I'm in tears, and just being super supportive. He recently went to PAX East and got a book signed for me (I didn't ask him to and didn't know he was doing this) because I was really sad that I couldn't go. I really want to do something nice for him, but I'm having a hard time thinking of ideas...my head is too full of school things ;-;

About him: physics phd student, loves biking and running, (and forces himself to swim), enjoys reading (favorite book is The Name of the Wind), watching neflix, and casual gamer.

I don't have a whole heck of a lot of money, since I'm in school full time, but I do work too, so I can spend a bit on this. Maybe like ~$100? Spring break is in a week, and we live about an hour north of Boston!

Give me your fun ideas!!

TL;DR: I want to do something nice for my boyfriend who's been super supportive and understanding, but I'm stuck on ideas. He's a physics PhD student, loves biking, running, reading, and gaming. I have ~$100 to spend and we live near Boston. Help me out!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Aww, that's so sweet of you! I think you should get him a personalized item related to his favorite book, The Name of the Wind. Maybe a customized bookmark or a print of the cover art? You could also get him a gift card to a local bike shop or a running store since he enjoys those activities. If you want to splurge, you could even get him tickets to a concert or a sporting event in Boston!"
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I love that you want to do something nice for him! It's great that you're acknowledging his efforts and wanting to show your appreciation. Since you mentioned he loves reading, you could get him a new book by his favorite author or a book that's related to his interests. You could also get him a gift card to a coffee shop or a bookstore so he can treat himself to a new read. If you want to do something more experiential, you could plan a fun activity together, like going on a hike or trying out a new restaurant in Boston!"
3. **u/romanticfool**: "I think you should get him a customized gift that shows you've been paying attention to his interests and hobbies. For example, you could get him a personalized bike bell or a customized water bottle with a message or inside joke. If you want to do something more sentimental, you could make him a photo album or a video montage of your favorite memories together. Whatever you choose, I'm sure he'll appreciate the thought and effort you put into it!"

TITLE: My [24M] girlfriend [20F] has depression and refuses to get a job.

POST: So I am stuck and dont know what to do. Im not asking for a solution im just asking for your opinion.

I have been seeing this girl for about 6 months now and it started out well. She was unemployed and actively seeking employment and living a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise. She is a nice girl and my freinds like her and get along with her well.

She had a previous relationship that ended badly and she got abused by her partner. She is on heavy medication to treat her depression and sometimes will cry for hours for absolutly no reason. I do my best to comfort her but it is hard for me to understand how it feels as i have never really felt bad depression.

I have been helping her look for work but now she doesn't even try. She has done self harm in the past and has bad scarring up her left arm. She has also stopped exercising and gained weight but she is still the kind person she was when i first met her.

I have talked to her about work and exersise and she gets upset when i mention her weight and just says she is still looking when i ask about work. She texts me at least 40 - 50 times everyday when im at work because she is bored. She says things like "promise you wont leave me" and "i dont know what i would do without you" things like that a lot.

I have tried talking to her parents aswell but they baby her too much and wont push her to do anything which i think may be the cause of the problem.

If she is away from me for more than 2 days she gets upset and depressed. It is starting to affect my personal and work life but i am honestly scared she will harm herself or go off her meds if i break up with her. To be honest i dont want to break up beacause i like her a lot. I only want to help her but how can i do this if she wont help herself?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has depression, refuses to get a job, and is self-harming. She's dependent on me and gets upset when I try to help her. I'm torn between wanting to help her and feeling like I'm enabling her behavior.

**Responses:**

1. **OP, you're not enabling her, you're just being a good partner.** I think you're being really understanding and supportive. It's not your job to fix her depression or get her a job, but it's great that you're trying to help. Have you considered couples therapy? A professional could help you both work through these issues together.
2. **You need to set boundaries.** I understand that you care about her, but you can't keep sacrificing your own life for her. You need to set some boundaries and prioritize your own needs. Maybe take some time for yourself, or do things that make you happy without her. This might help her see that she's not the only one who matters.
3. **Encourage her to see a therapist.** Depression is a serious issue, and it's great that she's on medication. But therapy can be really helpful in addition to medication. Maybe encourage her to see a therapist who specializes in depression and trauma. This could help her work through her issues and develop coping strategies.
4. **You can't fix her, but you can support her.** I know it's hard to see her struggling, but you can't fix her depression or get her a job. What you can do is support her and be there for her. Encourage her to do things that make her happy, and be patient with her when she's struggling.
5. **It's not your responsibility to fix her.** I know it's hard to hear, but it's not your responsibility to fix her depression or get her a job. You're not her parent, and you can't control her actions. What you can do is support her and be there for her, but ultimately, it's up to her to make changes in her life.

**Note:** The responses are a mix of empathy, advice, and tough love. Some users encourage the OP to set boundaries and prioritize his own needs, while others suggest seeking professional help or supporting his girlfriend in her struggles. The conversation is a representation of the complexities and challenges that come with supporting a loved one with depression.

TITLE: Me [22m] decided to break up with my girlfriend[22f] and I don't know if it's a good moment

POST: I wrote a post yesterday explaining that I want to break up my 4 years relationship.

I said that I don't feel the same, because she hates my friends and she is living miles away from me because she doesn't have money to stay in the city to continue her degree.

Today she has failed an exam and she is coming next monday to see it.

Is it a good moment to speak about my feelings?

I'm not sure if it's the right moment but I don't know when I'm going to be face to face with her again. It could be months.

I need advice.

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend and she's coming to see me next monday. Is it a good moment to talk about my feelings?

**Comments:**

* "I think it's better to have this conversation when you're both in the same place and can have a calm and respectful conversation. It's not fair to dump her over a failed exam. Try to reschedule the conversation for when she's feeling better and you're both in a good headspace."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not about the exam, it's about the fact that you've been feeling unhappy in the relationship for a while. You should have this conversation with her when you're both calm and can have a real talk. Don't use her exam as an excuse to break up with her."
* "I think it's okay to have the conversation now, but be prepared for her to be upset and emotional. Try to be empathetic and understanding, but also be clear and direct about your feelings. Remember that you're not responsible for her emotions, but you are responsible for being honest with her."
* "I think you should have this conversation with her, but also be prepared for her to try to convince you to stay in the relationship. She might be feeling desperate and scared, so be firm but kind. Remember that you deserve to be happy and if you're not feeling it in this relationship, then it's okay to move on."
* "I think it's better to have this conversation in person, but if you can't do that, then a video call or phone call is better than a text or email. Be honest and clear about your feelings, but also be respectful and empathetic. Remember that this is a big decision and it's okay to take your time and think about it."

TITLE: I'm stuck with what happened tonight. I don't know what to think. (This is all over the place, I'm sorry.)

POST: I'm 32/F he's 29/M, together 1 year friends for 2 before that off and on. My guy we'll call Luke and I went to our first pregnancy appointment today. I'm about 6 weeks. We've had a crazy day with his car not working right, supposed to be fixed but the hood flew up and crashed into the windshield while on the highway. Took it to his mechanic and we got another car to get home in. 

On our way to my place there's this stray cat in the road and it darts back across the street in front of the car. Luke doesn't even brake or swerve to miss it. We've talked about moving in together but he doesn't want my cats to come along. He's never had indoor pets or much of pets while growing up. Cats have been my companions all my life. My first pregnancy 9 years ago I went it alone and because of where I was living I had to give up my cats then to have the baby, alone. I gave them up. It wasn't feasible then. So here we go again. He wants me to give them up because he doesn't want inside pets. My Harley has food allergies and is racking up lots of debt for me with health problems and expensive cat foods. Mallory can be obnoxious sometimes. 

He lives with his parents has for 7 years now. I have my own apartment and bills and such. He's never had to be responsible or adult until now. He won't have a civilized conversation about keeping the baby or not. Is this really a good choice, what's the right answer? He says we can do it but the cats have to go. Even then he still wants to maintain two apartments. I get SSI Disability and am looking for work. He has a stable job. We need each other to do this right. But his lack of empathy tonight with the stray cat leaves me feeling scared of him. 

Any advice? This is my first time having a partner to have a baby with but I feel like I'm doing all the sacrificing.

TL;DR: I'm 6 weeks pregnant with my boyfriend Luke, we've been together for 1 year. He doesn't want my 2 cats to come live with us, citing his lack of experience with indoor pets. He's unwilling to have a civilized conversation about keeping the baby or not. He's never had to be responsible or adult until now and I'm feeling scared of him after he didn't even brake for a stray cat on the highway tonight. I feel like I'm doing all the sacrificing and I'm not sure if this is a good choice for me.

This post is a mix of emotions, concerns, and questions. The author is feeling overwhelmed and unsure about her relationship and the future of her pregnancy. She's worried about her cats, Harley and Mallory, and feels like she's doing all the sacrificing in the relationship. She's also concerned about Luke's lack of empathy and responsibility, as seen in his reaction to the stray cat on the highway.

The post is seeking advice and guidance from the community, asking if this is a good choice for her and if she should be with someone who is unwilling to have a civilized conversation about their future together. The author is looking for support and reassurance that she's not alone in her feelings and that there are people who understand what she's going through.

TITLE: When did NC start working for you?

POST: first love [24m] and I [20f] broke up 9 months ago but only decided to initiate strict NC 3 weeks ago. I still think about him and miss him constantly and I know he's been seeing another girl so that makes it about 100 times worse. I lost a lot of my social circle due to the breakup so I'm alone a lot while he's with good friends all the time. I just feel crappy a lot and constantly have this lingering pain and him in the back of my mind and I'm scared it'll never go away. Can someone share some personal stories of hardship so I feel less alone? Will NC eventually do what it's supposed to at some point. I don't feel much different now than I did when we initiated it.

TL;DR: 9 months since breakup, 3 weeks since strict NC, still thinking about ex and missing him, feeling crappy and alone. Want to know if NC will eventually get easier and if others have gone through similar struggles.

COMMENTS:

* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's tough to move on from someone you loved deeply. I've been in a similar situation and it took me a while to get to a place where I could think about my ex without feeling a strong emotional response. It's not easy, but it's possible. For me, it was about focusing on self-care and finding new hobbies and interests to distract me from my feelings. It also helped to have a support system of friends and family who could offer me a listening ear and some words of encouragement. As for NC, it's different for everyone, but I think it's common to feel like it's not working at first. It's like your brain is still wired to respond to your ex in a certain way, even if you're not actively thinking about them. But with time and effort, it can get easier. You're not alone in this, and you will get through it."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling with the breakup and the fact that your ex is moving on. It's normal to feel that way, especially when it feels like everyone around you is moving on with their lives. But here's the thing: you are not alone. I went through a similar situation a few years ago, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever gone through. But I learned that it's okay to feel sad and angry and hurt. It's okay to take time to process your emotions and figure out who you are without your ex. And it's okay to take things at your own pace. Don't put pressure on yourself to 'get over it' or'move on' by a certain time. Just focus on taking care of yourself and doing what feels right for you. As for NC, it's true that it can take time to get used to. But it's not impossible. I think it's helpful to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than worrying about the future or what your ex is doing. You got this, and you will come out stronger on the other side."

TITLE: I[26m] want to break up with my girlfriend[36f] of 20 months, but still love her and feel extremely guilty

POST: I love my girlfriend dearly, but she has kids and I have no children of my own.  I don't feel like I'm right for fatherhood, I'm a very irritable person.  I feel she wants to get married and settle down, and because of her age it's fairly important to her.  I'm not ready for this, or to be strongly tied to anything.  The only thing stopping me is the guilt, I love her and fear I might crush her... and make her jaded, emtionally insecure for future relationships.  Am I being weak? Am I being to considerate?  Will she be OK?  I appreciate any advice, thanks redditors

TL;DR: I'm 26, been with my 36-year-old girlfriend for 20 months. I love her, but I'm not ready for marriage and kids. I'm worried about crushing her and making her insecure. I'm torn between my own desires and my guilt about hurting her.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're not being weak, you're being honest with yourself. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not ready for the commitment and responsibilities that come with being in a long-term relationship. It's better to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns rather than leading her on or pretending to be something you're not. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires, even if it means hurting someone you care about."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you're considering your girlfriend's feelings and wanting to avoid hurting her. However, it's also important to remember that you can't control how someone else feels or reacts. What you can control is how you communicate your feelings and boundaries. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and be prepared to listen to her perspective as well. It's possible that she may be more understanding than you think, or that she may have concerns of her own that you're not aware of."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I think you're being too focused on the 'crushing her' aspect. While it's natural to feel guilty about hurting someone you care about, it's not necessarily your responsibility to protect her from emotional pain. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires, even if it means causing someone else pain. That being said, it's still important to communicate your feelings and boundaries in a respectful and empathetic way. Remember that you can't control how someone else reacts, but you can control how you approach the conversation."
4. **u/heartbroken_hippie**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not ready for marriage and kids, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires. It's not selfish to want to be happy and fulfilled in your own life. Remember that your girlfriend is an adult and can make her own decisions. If she's willing to work through this with you and have an open and honest conversation, then that's great. But if not, then it may be time to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it's truly healthy and fulfilling for both of you."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're being too focused on the 'guilt' aspect. Instead of worrying about crushing your girlfriend, focus on having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Remember that relationships are about growth and evolution, and it's okay to change and adapt as individuals. If you're not ready for marriage and kids, that's okay. It's better to be honest and upfront about your feelings rather than leading her on or pretending to be something you're not. Good luck with the conversation!"

TITLE: Me (21F) with my boyfriend (22M) of four years, in love but I have an intense fantasy of having sex with a woman.

POST: at the start of my four year relationship, I thought I was completely straight, realised I was also attracted to females, but never had any desire to experiment. as I became more sexually experienced I realised I wanted to have sex with a girl. it's something that has been on my mind for about 2 years and I can't seem to get over the fantasy. 

my boyfriend knows about this, though probably not aware of how strong my desire is. I don't think I could go my whole life without doing it, I mean i could, but I would definitely feel like I am missing out on something. it's started to affect how satisfied I am with my relationships sex life (we still have sex frequently, and I enjoy it, but I find my mind wandering to how it would feel if it were a girl). 

my boyfriend has actually said he would be okay with me doing it, and thinks it would be hot. he's even suggested a threesome (not sure I could do that) or him just watching me with another girl. I'm more inclined to the latter option, but if the girl was willing to include him in it as well, I might consider it, although the idea is a bit nerve wracking for me.

so my question is, is it possible to explore your sexuality outside the relationship without damaging it, and if so, how would I even go about finding someone that would agree to sleep with me (us), no strings attached, possibly have my boyfriend watch or join in?

TL;DR: I'm a 21F in a 4-year relationship with a 22M. I have a strong fantasy of having sex with a woman. My boyfriend is okay with it, but I'm unsure how to explore this without damaging our relationship or finding someone willing to do it with us.

TITLE: I have a fantasy of having sex with a woman, but I'm in a relationship and my partner is okay with it. How do I explore this without damaging our relationship?

POST: I've been in a relationship with my partner for 4 years and we have a great connection. However, I've recently developed a strong fantasy of having sex with a woman. My partner is okay with it and has even suggested we try a threesome or him watching me with another girl. I'm more interested in the latter option, but I'm unsure how to go about finding someone who would be willing to do it with us.

I'm worried that if I pursue this, it could damage our relationship. I love my partner and I don't want to lose them. But at the same time, I feel like I'm missing out on an important part of my sexuality if I don't explore this fantasy.

I'm looking for advice on how to approach this situation. Should I try to find someone who is interested in a casual encounter, or should I try to find someone who is looking for a more serious relationship? Are there any specific websites or apps that you would recommend for finding someone who is interested in this type of encounter?

TITLE: Do I [20 M] tell my SO [20 F] that she has gained weight?

POST: Let me preface this by stating that I have nothing at all against fat people. It's a body shape like any other and should be respected as such.

That being said, both my girlfriend and I would prefer to stay in shape. About a year ago we agreed that if one of us were to even start putting on weight, the other would let them know. Well, over the past few months she has been getting a little heavier. Nothing crazy or off-putting by any means (I'm attracted to her regardless) but I can't help but think about when we made that promise. 

We're very close and communicate well but she can get rather emotional sometimes so hurting her is the last thing I want to do. She mentioned to me that her mom had just recently commented on her weight and she (my SO) seemed pretty offended. 

For background and to preemptively answer some comments that may pop up: We don't live very close to each other and have relatively busy schedules so asking her to join me at the gym would be difficult. She's active through other activities but her diet isn't great.

Should I say something? If I did, how would I bring it up?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has gained weight, we agreed to tell each other if one of us started putting on weight, but I'm worried about hurting her feelings.

TITLE: I am just so confused

POST: So last month at a party for my grandma's birthday, my grandma says there is this girl that she wants me to meet.  I'm apprehensive because my grandma is famous for setting my brother up on a date with a one armed girl. No offense to the one armed ladies out there, it just took my brother by surprise.  I also haven't dated much (read: at all), but I finally got a handle on some major depression and anxiety that has ruined my life for the past 10 years, so I agree to meet her.

So we go on a few dates, and awesomely enough she is not only cute as hell but fun to talk to and hang out with.  I have an awesome time, and as far as I can tell she has a great time too.  Couple of days after we last get together she asks if we can put off getting together again while she hunts for a job.  I say of course, because that seems pretty understandable to me.  

I text her a few times, asking how the hunt was going, or seeing if she had time to get dinner blah blah.  Didn't ever hear anything back.  5 weeks go by, don't hear anything.  O well, she is either still on the job hunt, or just not interested I suppose.  Then this morning I get back from the gym to see she accepted a facebook friend request I sent her a long time ago.  According to my notifications, she accepted the request, liked some status I made yesterday, then unfriended me.

So I write this to repeat that cliché of I don't understand women.  Also, I'm letting facebook news bother me, so that's pretty cool too!

TL;DR: I met a girl through my grandma, we had a great time, she asked to slow down, didn't hear back, then accepted my friend request and unfriended me.

TITLE: Reddit, where the hell should I get married? Help!

POST: * My fiance and I live 300 miles apart; he lives in St. Louis, and I live in Alabama. 

* In seven months, I'll be moving to live with him permanently.

* Our tentative date for the wedding is May 2013. 

* We have no idea where to have the wedding. 

I'd been leaning towards having it in St. Louis, since by the time of the wedding, I'll have been living there for a year. Also, the city has more of a "party" atmosphere in general. Many people in the South (parts of my family included) can be a little uptight when it comes to alcohol. I want the wedding to be a drunken celebration, and I want to attract a fun crowd.

My mom really wants me to have it here in Alabama, because she thinks most of my family won't be able to afford to go if we have it in St. Louis. She says it's customary to have the wedding where the bride's family lives. 

Another argument she has is that my family is much larger than my fiance's, so I have more people to accommodate. She tells me to have the wedding where I want, but I know she'll guilt me forever if I don't have it here.

I wouldn't mind having it in Alabama, but I think it would make planning harder. I would love to have my family/friends to be able to come, but I also want *his* family/friends to come too.

My fiance is little help and doesn't have a strong opinion either way. His parents aren't picky where the wedding is either.

I've asked others for their opinions, but I was hoping that maybe Reddit can provide some magical answer that I haven't thought of yet. Or maybe some insight I haven't yet considered.

TL;DR: I'm torn between having my wedding in St. Louis (where I'll be living) or Alabama (where my family is). I want a fun, party atmosphere, but also want to include both our families. Help!*

---

**Reddit's Response:**

* Many users suggested having the wedding in a neutral location, such as a city in between St. Louis and Alabama, or a destination wedding in a place that's easy for both families to travel to.
* Some users encouraged the OP to prioritize their own desires and preferences, rather than trying to please everyone else.
* A few users pointed out that having the wedding in Alabama might not be as expensive as the OP thinks, especially if they're willing to compromise on the guest list or venue.
* One user suggested having a small, intimate ceremony in St. Louis and a larger reception in Alabama, or vice versa.
* Many users offered words of encouragement and support, reminding the OP that ultimately, the decision is theirs to make.

**The OP's Response:**

* The OP thanked everyone for their input and said that they were considering a destination wedding in a place like Nashville or New Orleans, which would be easy for both families to travel to.
* They mentioned that they were also thinking about having a small, intimate ceremony in St. Louis and a larger reception in Alabama, or vice versa.
* The OP expressed gratitude for the support and encouragement from the Reddit community, and said that they felt more confident in their decision-making process.

**The Moral of the Story:**

* The Reddit community provided a safe and supportive space for the OP to share their concerns and receive advice from others.
* The OP was able to consider different perspectives and options, and ultimately made a decision that worked for them.
* The story highlights the importance of prioritizing one's own desires and preferences, while also being considerate of others' feelings and needs.

TITLE: Hey r/jobs, I need some advice on an upcoming promotion!

POST: First off let me say that I love my job.  I get to do what I love, in a killer place, but I don't really make a lot of money considering the field I'm in.  I work in a non-profit museum institution doing video production, and AV technical support as a secondary element to the job.  My salary is barely ok for an entry level position in my field (~30K), even though the work I've been doing up until this point is quite beyond entry level imo, but that's neither here nor there.  

My predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.  While I agree I do want to keep making creative videos, I'm weary that they're going to try and dump his work load (relatively little in comparison) on top of mine with a minimal raise.  There is very much a rank non-profit culture here, very top heavy, and upward mobility is notoriously difficult (just as a caveat to anyone who might understand the particulars).  

And so my question is, how do I figure out in a cordial and non-confrontational way how much is fair for them to offer me for the promotion with additional responsibilities?  I realize I could just ask my current boss how much he's making but that doesn't seem proper or legit, plus he's been here for 20 years so they can always pull the seniority card.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!

TL;DR: I'm being offered a promotion to a manager role with minimal raise, but additional responsibilities. How do I figure out what's fair without being confrontational or asking my current boss's salary?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'd say it's totally reasonable to ask for a salary range for the new role. You can say something like 'I'm excited about the opportunity to take on this new role, but I want to make sure I'm being fairly compensated. Can you give me a sense of what the salary range is for this position?' That way you're not directly asking about your current boss's salary, but you're still getting a sense of what the market rate is for the role."
2. **careeradvice**: "OP, I'd recommend doing some research on the market rate for AV managers in non-profits. You can use websites like Glassdoor or Payscale to get an idea of what similar roles are paying. Then, you can use that information to make a strong case for why you deserve a certain salary range for the new role. Remember to also consider your own skills, experience, and qualifications when making your case."
3. **nonprofitpro**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. Non-profits can be tough when it comes to salary and benefits. But, you do have some leverage here. Since you're being offered a promotion, you can use that as an opportunity to negotiate a better salary. Just remember to be respectful and professional during the negotiation process. Good luck!"
4. **jobsearcher**: "OP, I'd say it's worth considering whether or not you really want to take on the additional responsibilities without a significant salary increase. If you're already feeling overwhelmed with your current workload, adding more responsibilities could be a recipe for burnout. Maybe it's worth exploring other opportunities that offer a better work-life balance and a more competitive salary."
5. **hrpro**: "OP, I'd recommend having a conversation with your current boss about your concerns and expectations. It's okay to express your reservations about taking on the additional responsibilities without a significant salary increase. You can say something like 'I'm excited about the opportunity to take on this new role, but I'm concerned about the impact it will have on my workload and salary. Can we discuss what kind of support and compensation I can expect?' That way, you're having an open and honest conversation about your concerns and expectations."

TITLE: [16/m] I can't decide whether or not I should break up with my partner [16/f]

POST: I've been debating on the topic on if I should end my relationship. I'm not sure if what I feel for (let's call her Kelly) Kelly is genuine love, yet I have a strong feeling that it really is. Perhaps it's just because I'm going through high school and this is just the result of raging developing testosterone, but I digress. The kicker is that Kelly is near-depressed and mainly relies on me for emotional and moral support because of her abusive family and she can be self-abusive if she reaches a certain point of sadness (Note: when we broke up before it was because of her abusive father getting mad at her and out of emotion she broke up with me since I didn't come to offend her. In retrospect, she felt guilty about it and decided to re-start our relationship. She said she became a shut-in and didn't eat for two days, looking back that seemed somewhat ridiculous.) I feel like she also expects too much of a person like me with no type of job and her unneeded materialistic ideals are malicious to both my psyche and my bank account (I have no job). More and more, we are having arguments and fights starting for no apparent reason; just earlier today she got angry at me since I decided to hang out with my friends instead of her (but I was going to see her in a few days anyways). I also feel like that she'll become terminally depressed since she tends to be over-dramatic about things and do dangerous things to herself... I care for her, but her security, well-being, and health may be in danger if I end our relationship. Please respond, Reddit.

TL;DR: 16-year-old boy unsure if he should break up with his 16-year-old girlfriend who has depression and relies on him emotionally. He feels she expects too much of him and is worried about her well-being if they break up.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Dude, you're 16. You're still in high school. You don't have to make life-or-death decisions right now. Take some time to think about what you want and what's best for you. If you're feeling suffocated or overwhelmed, it might be okay to take a break or re-evaluate the relationship. But don't make any rash decisions. You're young, and there's plenty of time to figure things out."

2. **u/relationship_guru**: "It sounds like you're feeling trapped and unsure about your feelings. That's normal! Take some time to reflect on what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. Have an open and honest conversation with Kelly about your concerns and see if you can work through them together. Remember, relationships are about compromise and communication. If you're feeling like you're walking on eggshells all the time, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship."

3. **u/concerned_citizen**: "I'm concerned about Kelly's well-being. It sounds like she's relying too heavily on you for emotional support, and that's not healthy for either of you. Have you considered encouraging her to seek professional help for her depression? It's great that you're trying to be supportive, but you can't be her sole source of comfort. Also, it's not your responsibility to fix her problems or make her happy. You deserve to be happy too!"

4. **u/realistic_realist**: "Listen, relationships are hard, especially when you're young. It's okay to admit that you're not sure if you're ready for this level of commitment. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unhappy, it might be time to take a step back and re-evaluate. Remember, you're not obligated to stay in a relationship that's not making you happy. And honestly, Kelly's behavior sounds pretty concerning. You deserve better than someone who's self-abusive and expects you to be her sole source of support."

5. **u/teen_talk**: "Hey, OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before. It's tough to know what to do when you care about someone but feel like they're draining you. Have you tried talking to a trusted adult, like a guidance counselor or a teacher, about your concerns? They might be able to offer some valuable advice or support. And remember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being. You don't have to sacrifice your own happiness for someone else's sake."

TITLE: lol at `smart`women....

POST: So i was browsing plenty of fish. com today just for the lulz and maybe some scene hoe jack off material.... when i came across a lot of girls profiles....
almost all were `education : some uni/college `and then id look on occupation and see shit like cashier, hostess LMAO why the fuck would you go to uni and then have a shit job like taht..... first of all if i was even interested in you i wouldnt even date a chick who is too dumb to finish college or uni.... fuck sake ill work my ass off and you make minimum wage selling shoes and fries%
? fuck that shit

TL;DR: OP is browsing Plenty of Fish, sees a lot of girls with college/university education but working low-paying jobs, and is confused and annoyed by it.

REDDIT RESPONSES:

* "Dude, you're on a dating site, not a job interview. If someone's education doesn't align with their job, it doesn't mean they're not smart or capable. Maybe they're just not passionate about their field or have other priorities."
* "I'm a cashier and I have a degree in a field I'm not currently working in. It doesn't mean I'm not smart or capable, it just means I'm taking my time to figure out what I want to do with my life. And btw, being a cashier is not a'shit job'. It's a job that requires people skills and attention to detail."
* "You're judging people based on their job and education, but what about people who are working multiple jobs to make ends meet? What about people who are pursuing their passion but it's not a 'traditional' career? You're so focused on your own narrow-minded views that you're missing out on the complexity of human experience."
* "I'm a hostess and I have a degree in a field I'm passionate about. I'm working on my own schedule and making my own money, and I'm not ashamed of it. You should focus on finding someone who is genuine and kind, not someone who fits your narrow definition of'smart'."

The post and responses highlight the importance of not making assumptions about people based on their job or education. The OP is judging people based on their job and education, without considering the complexity of human experience and the many factors that can influence someone's career choices. The responses encourage the OP to focus on finding someone who is genuine and kind, rather than someone who fits their narrow definition of "smart". The post also highlights the importance of not making assumptions about people based on their job or education, and the need to consider the complexity of human experience.

TITLE: I [15 M] was broken up with by my Girlfriend [15 F] after only dating for a month, friends act like I should feel bad

POST: I dated this girl for only a month, and she broke up with me because she decided she might be a lesbian. We've only been broken up with for a little over a week now, and I've accepted it since it wasn't for that long and we broke up on good terms

However, everyone acts like I should be completely heartbroken. She was my first girlfriend and I did really like her, but I'm nowhere near as bothered by it as people think I should be. I keep hearing people say I need to take time out to find myself and that I'm rushing things by wanting to find someone else now.

 Is it really wrong for me to move on so soon, or am I just doing things at my own pace?

TL;DR: I was broken up with by my first girlfriend after a month, and everyone thinks I should be devastated. I'm not really bothered by it and want to move on. Is it wrong for me to do so?

TITLE: Me[25M] with my EX GF [18F] 2 years, We broke up because I flirted with another girl

POST: # Part 1
I'm finding it hard to understand something. My ex GF broke up with me 6 months ago, I tried winning her back for 6 months. We would see each other once every 2 weeks and we'd get on like 2 peas in a pod and she kept leading me on, however 2 days after seeing her she would tell me it was a mistake and that we can't speak anymore. This of course was really unfair and caused me great depression. 

# Part 2
After dealing with this for 6 months I decided to completely cut her out, and I've been doing good by not messaging her anymore. She still messages me almost every 2nd night. I don't get it.. She doesn't want anything to do with me however she still messages me. Surely if someone wanted to cut someone out of their life they wouldn't go through all the trouble of constantly messaging someone? 

# Part 3
I guess what I'm trying to get at is, does anyone have an explanation as to why someone who broke up with me keeps messaging me even after I said goodbye for good? 

Thanks

TL;DR: Ex GF broke up with me 6 months ago because I flirted with another girl. I tried to win her back for 6 months, but she kept leading me on and then cutting me off. I've cut her out of my life, but she still messages me almost every 2nd night. I don't understand why she's still messaging me if she wants nothing to do with me.

This post is a great example of a common phenomenon in relationships: the "mixed signals" or "mixed messages" that can lead to confusion and frustration. The OP (original poster) is trying to make sense of his ex's behavior, which seems contradictory and hurtful.

The post highlights several key issues:

1. **Mixed signals**: The OP's ex is sending mixed signals by messaging him regularly, but also telling him she wants nothing to do with him. This can be confusing and frustrating for the OP.
2. **Unrealistic expectations**: The OP is holding onto the hope that his ex will change her mind and want to be with him again. However, this is unlikely, and he needs to accept that the relationship is over.
3. **Boundary issues**: The OP's ex is not respecting his boundaries by continuing to message him despite his clear indication that he wants nothing to do with her.
4. **Emotional manipulation**: The OP's ex may be using emotional manipulation to keep him invested in the relationship, even though she has made it clear she doesn't want to be with him.

The post also highlights the importance of setting clear boundaries and communicating one's needs and desires in a relationship. The OP needs to prioritize his own emotional well-being and focus on moving on from the relationship.

The community's response to this post is likely to be a mix of empathy, advice, and encouragement to move on. Some users may offer words of comfort, while others may provide practical advice on how to deal with the situation. Overall, the post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance for those navigating complex and challenging relationship situations.

TITLE: Me [31F] with my fiance [48M] of 2 years, finding it more and more difficult to work together at our job.

POST: We met at our job, with him being a supervisor and I, an entry level worker. I have worked there for seven years while he has been there for four years. We fell in love quickly and have went strongly together ever since. 

However, a few months ago I was promoted to supervisor, too. I was happy because it meant more money for us to accomplish our goals. I thought he was happy as well. Only now he takes to arguing with me at work and shaming me when I make a mistake or take too long to complete a task. I kindly let him know that I feel he isn't addressing me respectfully and he says nothing in response. 

A few of those blow up times have been in front of other coworkers, which I find embarrassing and unprofessional. The next day, of course, it's like it never happened. 

It makes me feel like a complete failure and my heart breaks every single time because this is the person I love more than anyone else in this world. I don't want our work arguments to affect our relationship together but he literally gets so mad at me he stops talking to me altogether. 

He has been married twice. I'm a late bloomer. This is the first (and I'm hoping the last) long-term relationship I've ever had. So I'm having trouble understanding how someone who loves you can speak so harshly and get mad so quickly for the tiniest things.

TL;DR: Fiance and I are having trouble working together at our job. He's a supervisor and I'm a supervisor too. He argues with me, shames me, and gets mad in front of coworkers. I feel like a failure and my heart breaks every time. I don't know how to make it stop.

---

This post is a great example of how a relationship can be affected by the dynamics of a workplace. The OP (original poster) is struggling to navigate her feelings of embarrassment, shame, and failure due to her fiancé's behavior at work. She is also worried about the impact this is having on their relationship.

The post highlights several key issues:

1. Power imbalance: As a supervisor, the OP's fiancé has a level of authority over her, which may be contributing to his behavior.
2. Lack of communication: The OP feels that her fiancé is not addressing her respectfully and is not communicating effectively about his concerns.
3. Emotional labor: The OP is shouldering the emotional burden of their conflicts, feeling like a failure and having her heart broken every time.
4. Past experiences: The OP's fiancé has been married twice, which may be influencing his behavior and attitudes towards relationships.

The post also raises questions about how to address these issues and find a solution. Some possible responses from the community might include:

* Encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her fiancé about how his behavior is affecting her.
* Suggesting that the OP set boundaries and assert herself more clearly in their conflicts.
* Offering support and validation for the OP's feelings and experiences.
* Encouraging the OP to seek outside help, such as couples therapy, to work through their issues.

TITLE: Is it too early for me [27m] to buy a plane ticket for my SO [25F] for a major vacation?

POST: So I just met this girl about two months ago and everything has been going great.  We see eachother everyday, common interests everywhere, amazing sex, etc.  Problem is that in about a week, my work is sending me to Japan for 5 months.  I really like this girl, but its obviously unfair for me to expect a long distance relationship this early in the game.  We've both said that we aren't going to be looking for anyone else while I'm gone, but that we can't really apply any labels once I leave.

That being said, my work is not only paying for all of my airfare, but they are also giving me a pretty hefty bonus for going there (about $20,000 plus incidentals and living expenses).  She has toyed with the idea of getting a ticket and coming to visit me, but I know the cost is a big concern (its about $1200-1400 from where we live).

Would it be weird for me to offer to go in on it with her or pay for half or something?  I feel like I'd really like her to come and I know she does too, but I don't want her to feel like I'm pushing too hard this early.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are in a new relationship, I'm leaving for 5 months, she's interested in visiting me but the cost is a concern. Should I offer to help pay for her ticket?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma in relationships: how to navigate a long-distance relationship, especially when one partner is being sent away for an extended period of time. The OP is considering offering to help pay for his girlfriend's plane ticket to visit him in Japan, but is unsure if it's too early in their relationship to make such an offer.

The comments on this post are mixed, with some users advising the OP to wait until they have a more established relationship before making such an offer, while others suggest that it's a thoughtful gesture and that the OP should go ahead and offer to help pay for the ticket.

Some common themes in the comments include:

* The importance of communication in relationships: Many users advise the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his plans and feelings, and to make sure they are on the same page before making any decisions.
* The need for boundaries: Some users suggest that the OP should set boundaries and not put too much pressure on his girlfriend to visit him, especially if she is not financially able to do so.
* The value of gestures: Many users praise the OP for considering such a thoughtful gesture, and suggest that it could be a great way to show his girlfriend that he is invested in their relationship.

Overall, this post highlights the challenges of navigating a long-distance relationship, and the importance of communication, boundaries, and thoughtful gestures in making it work.

TITLE: I [20M] have been on two dates with her [20F], she seems very shy and insecure. Should I run?

POST: I met this girl through a friend, and we've been on two (double) dates with two of our very close mutual friends (my best guy friend & female friend are dating, this is my best female friend's friend.) Each time in person she's very quiet and distant with me, and really doesn't talk a whole lot.

I understand some people are naturally shy, and that's okay, but she consistently texts me [very pessimistic things about herself] I'm wondering if I should let it play out, or take the red flags and run. She's otherwise a really nice girl, so I'm a little stuck on what to do.

TL;DR: Girl I've been on two dates with is very shy and insecure, consistently texts me negative things about herself, unsure if I should keep going or cut my losses.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not ready for a relationship or even a casual connection. If you're looking for someone who's confident and outgoing, you might want to keep looking."
* "I think you're being too harsh. She's shy and insecure, that doesn't mean she's not worth getting to know. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can connect on a deeper level."
* "I'm with the first commenter. If she's consistently texting you negative things about herself, that's a major red flag. You deserve someone who's confident and positive, not someone who's going to bring you down."
* "I think you should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just going through a tough time and needs someone to talk to. Try to be patient and understanding, and see if things improve over time."
* "I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's usually not worth it. You deserve someone who's going to make you feel good about yourself, not someone who's going to make you feel bad. Trust your instincts and move on."

This post highlights the common dilemma many people face when navigating relationships: whether to continue investing time and emotions in someone who may not be a good match, or to cut their losses and move on. The OP (original poster) is torn between his feelings for the girl and his concerns about her shyness and insecurity.

The comments reflect a range of opinions, from those who think the OP should move on to those who suggest giving the girl a chance to open up and connect on a deeper level. Some commenters point out that shyness and insecurity can be overcome with effort and understanding, while others argue that these traits are major red flags that indicate the relationship may not be healthy or sustainable.

Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, who must weigh his own feelings and priorities against the potential risks and challenges of pursuing a relationship with someone who may not be a good match. The post and comments serve as a reminder that relationships require effort, communication, and mutual understanding to succeed, and that it's okay to prioritize one's own emotional well-being and happiness.

TITLE: So Reddit, what is the most awkward way you've handled someone asking you out?

POST: So reddit, how have you awkwardly handled being asked out? I think I set the bar pretty high from my awkward and anti-social self:

I was sitting and eating lunch in the cafeteria of my school when a girl I had a huge crush on asked me out. I was super suspicious since I'm known as a smart but nerdy person. I said, "I don't know." and she responded pretty much by saying,"Okay, you can think about it and tell me later" with a surprised look. I was nervous, because I had recently told my friends I liked her, and if I said yes, and it was a prank, then my reputation would be screwed. I ended up saying, "I don't know" for around 3 days when she stopped asking me if I had made up my mind. I still think it was a dare because when I asked, she said it was for "personal reasons". If it was actually genuine, then  I hate myself.

TL;DR: I awkwardly handled being asked out by saying "I don't know" for 3 days, and then the girl stopped asking me.

---

This post is a great example of how the subreddit r/AskReddit works.

TITLE: I (19/f) live in a different state as my family with my (20/m) husband. Having major issues with my in-laws and Christmas.

POST: Sorry guys, this is going to be all over the place. I'm on my phone and I'm not very good at writing stories. 

I married my high school sweetheart 3 months ago (yay!) And moved out of state to follow him in his travels with the navy. I didn't care to leave because I knew we would always go home for the holidays, and if he couldn't, I would just go home by myself.  I'm very close to my family and would be miserable without visiting! Unfortunately my husband isn't so close with his parents because they're crazy racist. He's white and I'm hispanic. So racist to the point that they won't even allow me in their home. They say the nastiest things about me and the hispanic community to my husband and his younger siblings. My husband always defends me or just walks away. We got married at the courthouse and both of our families were invited to come witness it. All my family showed up and not one person from his even did so much as to call. My family absolutely adores my husband, they're very loving and open. And they of course want us to come stay with them for Christmas. He loves my family, but his parent's want him to stay at their home for Christmas.... Without me. I can't even described how much it hurts that he's actually considering it. Though I understand that he wants to see his younger siblings. I don't want him to go. I want him to come home to my family with me. My home is somewhere  we're both loved and accepted. His family makes me feel like scum and disgusting. Which is crazy because his family is trailor poor/white trash and I come from a very well off and civilized family. 
I feel like it might be selfish and bitchy of me to ask him not to stay there. I know that its his family, but they're so unreasonable. Am I wrong for being hurt and wanting him to come home with me?
Also, other than this we have an awesome marriage. This is basically our only issue. And we've been dealing with it for years.

TL;DR: I'm a 19/f married to a 20/m in the navy. We're having issues with his racist parents who won't accept me. They won't even let me in their home. We're supposed to spend Christmas together, but they want him to stay with them without me. I'm hurt and want him to come home with me to my family. Am I being selfish for wanting him to choose me over his family?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not selfish at all to want your husband to choose you over his family, especially when they're being so unreasonable and hurtful. You deserve to be loved and accepted by your partner's family, and it's not fair that you're being treated like this. Have you talked to your husband about how you're feeling? Maybe he's not aware of the impact his family's behavior is having on you.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's not okay for his family to treat you like this, and it's not okay for your husband to even consider staying with them without you.

You deserve to be prioritized and loved by your partner, and it's not fair to be treated like an afterthought.

You need to prioritize your own well-being and make sure that you're taking care of yourself during this time.

TITLE: How does a college student move states?

POST: To begin, and give context, it seems now two years after graduating high school that I am just sick of where I live. (No this isn't a *wah me* post.) So, I have always had the attitude, that if I don't like something in my life, I want to change it. 

I don't like being around people I grew up with. I am subscribed to my city's subreddit, and it seems that people only talk about where they would rather be, due to extreme heat and lack thereof things to do.

However, now I am asking you redditors for help and to see how you guys have moved on your own.

Beyond actually *deciding* which city I would want to move to, (I have narrowed down my decisions,) I need help on how to finance the move because right now, it seems completely unrealistic for meand it pains me. I feel somewhat trapped here. Now I have the transportation to move, and I could quite possibly put down one months payment on my lease. However, only being a college student, I don't have the experience to be considered for a job that one could just accept via the telephone. I would need an entry level job. It seems I would need a job previously to moving, because I can't spend weeks without pay scrambling to find a job.

I find myself in a catch 22.

I need success stories. Have any of you redditors out there moved all by yourself without the help of affulent parents or have handy tips for me to make my dream a reality?

TL;DR: I'm a college student who wants to move to a new state, but I don't have the experience or resources to make it happen. I'm looking for advice and success stories from redditors who have made similar moves.

I also saved up as much money as I could and used it to cover my expenses for the first few months. I got a part-time job as a server at a restaurant and worked my way up to full-time. It took some time, but I eventually found a job that paid enough for me to support myself. My advice would be to start applying to jobs online and saving up as much money as you can. It's also a good idea to have a plan in place for your first few months in your new city, such as finding a place to live and setting up utilities."

TITLE: Me (28f), my husband (29m) and his family Christmas Party.

POST: My husband and I have been married for three years.

We moved back to his home town shortly after getting married. One of the downsides to moving to his home town is that we are insanely far from my family, but our job prospects were better there, so we went. He has a very large family of Uncles, Aunts, and cousins galore. All very nice people, no real issues there.

The problem is that they have a yearly Christmas party and I have very bad anxiety issues. The past three years I've sucked it up and gone any ways, ending our visit with very bad panic attacks and my poor husband has had to cart me away back home (not that he complained).

We tried to compromise last year a little bit with going for two hours, but I really felt like I was ruining the party for my husband, who really only sees his family this one time a year, regardless of how close we are.

This year, I said that I'll just stay home and he can go as long as he wants. He's reluctantly agreed but is worried about what to say to his family about my absence. He doesn't like to lie, so he doesn't want to say that I'm home sick, but he also doesn't want to have to explain my anxiety, because thus far his family hasn't put that together yet and they would likely (this is just a guess) say that I should be going any ways to get over it. He doesn't want to argue with them the entire night about the benefits of treatments for anxiety disorders.

So my question is, what should my husband tell them when they ask where I am?

TL;DR: Husband and I have a yearly Christmas party with his family, but I have severe anxiety issues. Last year we compromised with a 2-hour visit, but this year I'm opting out. Husband is worried about what to tell his family about my absence. Should he tell them the truth, or find a different explanation?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, I think your husband should just tell them the truth. It's better to be honest and open about your struggles with anxiety than to make up some excuse or lie. His family will likely be understanding and supportive, and if they're not, then they're not the kind of people you want to be around anyway."
2. **u/AnxiousAnnie**: "I completely understand where you're coming from. I've had to deal with similar situations in the past. I think your husband should tell his family that you're taking a break from social events due to your anxiety. It's not a lie, but it's not the whole truth either. It's a way to acknowledge your struggles without going into too much detail."
3. **u/RelationshipAdvice**: "I think your husband should have a conversation with his family about your anxiety before the party. It's better to be upfront and honest about it than to make up some excuse or lie. He can explain that you're not feeling well and that you're taking a break from social events for a while. This way, his family will understand and be more supportive."
4. **u/ConcernedCousin**: "I'm a cousin of your husband's and I have to say, I'm a bit surprised that you're not going to the party. I know you're not close to the family, but it's Christmas and it's a special time for us. I hope you're doing okay and that you're taking care of yourself. Maybe next year you can come and we can catch up?"
5. **u/AnxietyWarrior**: "I'm an anxiety sufferer myself and I completely understand what you're going through. I think your husband should tell his family the truth, but also offer to send you a video message or something so they can still feel included. It's not about them, it's about your well-being and taking care of yourself. You do you, girl!"

TITLE: Me [18M] and a newly met girl online [22F] What do i do now?

POST: So I recently posted on CL looking to meet with someone new in my area for nothing too serious but something that could develop in the future and I got messaged by a girl who was interested. We Exchanged numbers but have been talking online more. 

Our plan was to get to know eachother and then maybe meet up and go on a date but in the few days we have been in contact she hasn't been engaging me in any convos. I text her and she doesnt respond but does when she is online through skype. I don't know if its a change of heart without telling me or something else but I really want to talk to her more but not come off like im pushing too hard or acting like a stalker.

She initially gave me her number and sent me a photo of what she looks like without me even asking so it doesnt seem like she isn't interested, and when I do initiate a convo she replies to me, but every time I bring up the idea of talking in person or arranging to meet up she seems to either not reply or ignore answering the question, and I cant work out why seeing as our main intention was to meet up!

So what do I do now to get her to talk to me and/or want to meet up without seeming like im being forward?

TL;DR: Girl I met online isn't engaging in convos and doesn't want to meet up, what do I do?

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not interested in meeting up or talking to you as much as you'd like. It's okay to accept that and move on. Don't keep pushing her to talk or meet up if she's not reciprocating the effort."
* "Have you tried asking her directly what's going on? Sometimes people just need a little nudge to open up. You could say something like 'Hey, I've noticed we haven't been talking as much lately. Is everything okay? Are you still interested in meeting up?'"
* "I think you're overthinking this. If she's not responding to your texts, it's probably because she's not interested. Don't take it personally and move on. There are plenty of other people out there who would love to chat with you."
* "It's possible that she's just busy or going through a tough time, but if she's not making an effort to talk to you or meet up, it's probably not worth your time. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to communicate and meet up."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your intentions. Are you looking for a serious relationship or just a casual hookup? If it's the former, you might want to consider looking for someone who is more interested in meeting up and talking. If it's the latter, you might want to just enjoy the online conversation and see where it goes."

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my GF [18 F] since 3 month, in a long distance relationship, she's depressed

POST: Hi, first of all, sorry for my english...

so i'm dating this girl that i really, really love, but we are living in different countries and can only see each other on vacations and like 1-2 week ends each month, wich is hard but wont last more than a year since i plan on moving in nearer.

But there was this last week end when i came to her house for the first time (She usually went to mine) and met her family, everything went smooth and all but now she is super sad because she misses me a lot apparently, and she got intrusive thoughts like she'd preffered i didn't came that week end.

 I don't think i'm losing her but i want her to be happy again. And all my listenings and advice don't seem to help a lot, even if it used to solve everything until now... 
What else can i do to show her?

TL;DR: My girlfriend is depressed and is missing me a lot after our last week end together. She got intrusive thoughts and is sad. I want to help her but don't know what else to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm not a professional, but it sounds like your girlfriend is struggling with separation anxiety. Have you considered talking to her about it? Maybe she's feeling overwhelmed and needs some reassurance that you're committed to the relationship and will make it work. Also, it might be helpful to establish a consistent communication schedule, like daily calls or video chats, to help her feel more connected to you."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, it's great that you're aware of your girlfriend's struggles and want to help. However, it's important to remember that depression is a serious mental health condition that requires professional treatment. Have you considered encouraging her to seek help from a therapist or counselor? They can provide her with the tools and support she needs to manage her depression and work through her feelings of sadness and anxiety."
3. **u/long_distance_relationships**: "OP, I totally get it. Long distance relationships can be tough, especially when you're not used to it. But it sounds like you're making an effort to stay connected and communicate with your girlfriend. That's awesome! Maybe you could try doing some fun activities together over video chat, like watching a movie or playing a game. It might help take her mind off things and give you both something to look forward to."
4. **u/depressed_and_lonely**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear that your girlfriend is struggling with depression. I know how hard it can be to feel like you're losing your partner. But it sounds like you're trying your best to support her, and that's amazing. Just remember that depression is not something that can be 'fixed' by someone else. It's a journey that requires patience, understanding, and support. Keep being there for her, and don't give up on her."

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP's girlfriend is struggling with depression and separation anxiety, and it's important to acknowledge and validate her feelings.
* The OP should consider encouraging his girlfriend to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor.
* Establishing a consistent communication schedule can help the girlfriend feel more connected to the OP.
* Doing fun activities together over video chat can help take her mind off things and give them something to look forward to.
* Depression is a serious mental health condition that requires patience, understanding, and support. The OP should continue to be there for his girlfriend and not give up on her.

TITLE: How soon is too soon to meet a SO's parents?

POST: I've been dating this guy for just over a month, but we've spent pretty much every second of our free time together. As in 6 sleepovers a week, and Friday night - Monday morning without a second apart. So it feels a lot more serious than your average one-month relationship. 

He invited me to spend Mother's Day weekend with them. They live a few hours away. I would not be going home for the holiday anyway, so that is not a factor.

My questions:

1. Is it too early to spend a whole weekend at his parents' home, regardless of the holiday?

2. Is it too early to spend what I consider to be an important family holiday with his family?

My instincts are telling me that I should just wait at least another month, but I don't want my declination to put a damper on the relationship or hurt his feelings.

TL;DR: Dating guy for 1 month, we're super close, he invited me to spend Mother's Day weekend with his parents. Is it too early to meet his parents, and is it too early to spend a family holiday with them?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's too early. You've only been dating for a month, and you're already spending 6 sleepovers a week with him? That's a lot of time spent together, and you're not even sure if you're compatible long-term. Meeting his parents and spending a family holiday with them is a big step, and you should wait at least 3-6 months before doing so."
2. **u/Redditor99**: "I think it's too early to meet his parents, but not necessarily because of the holiday. It's just that you're still getting to know each other, and meeting his parents can be a big responsibility. You should make sure you're ready for that level of commitment before taking it on. Maybe you could suggest doing something smaller, like a casual dinner or a day trip, before committing to a whole weekend at their home."
3. **u/SkepticalSarah**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Meeting his parents and spending a family holiday with them is not a make-or-break moment in the relationship. If you're feeling uncomfortable or unsure, it's okay to say no and wait until you're more ready. But if you're genuinely excited to spend time with his family and get to know them better, then go for it! Just make sure you're not doing it just to please him or to avoid hurting his feelings."
4. **u/RelationshipRookie**: "I think it's a good idea to wait at least another month before meeting his parents. You're still getting to know each other, and you want to make sure you're on the same page before introducing each other to your families. Plus, meeting his parents can be a big deal, and you want to make sure you're ready for that level of commitment. Maybe you could suggest doing something smaller, like a casual dinner or a day trip, before committing to a whole weekend at their home."

**Conclusion:** The majority of commenters agree that it's too early to meet his parents and spend a family holiday with them, especially considering the short duration of the relationship. They suggest waiting at least another month to get to know each other better and to make sure you're ready for that level of commitment. However, some commenters also emphasize that it's not a make-or-break moment in the relationship, and that you should prioritize your own feelings and comfort level. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but it's essential to consider your own readiness and the potential implications of meeting his parents and spending a family holiday with them.

TITLE: Could use some advice...

POST: Fair warning, this is my first post to Reddit, and I'm on mobile. Please bare with me.

A week ago, I decided to start a (hopefully) lifelong journey to slowly yet steadily improve my life. I bought a scale, and weighed myself at 340lbs. I wasn't nearly as upset as I probably should've been, considering I was expecting closer to 400lbs.

That very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.

The next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! 

Now for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week. And I'm actually having trouble meeting this. Just wondering if I should be concerned if I'm not even coming close to the calories that are suggested I eat in a day. Note, I do NOT feel hungry.

TL;DR: I'm trying to lose 100lbs in a year, and I'm having trouble meeting the daily calorie intake suggested by myfitnesspal. I've stopped drinking soda, and I'm trying to cut back on calories. Any advice?

---

**Comments:**

1. Congrats on taking the first step! You're doing great so far. I'd recommend increasing your protein intake to help with satiety and muscle growth. Also, try to eat more frequent, smaller meals throughout the day to help with hunger and portion control.
2. I'm glad you're tracking your progress with myfitnesspal! However, I think you might be underestimating your daily calorie needs. 2500cal/day might be too low for your body, especially if you're trying to lose weight. Have you considered increasing your daily calorie intake to 2800-3000cal/day? This might help you meet your weight loss goals.
3. I'm a big fan of intermittent fasting! It's helped me lose weight and improve my overall health. You might consider trying a 16:8 schedule, where you eat during an 8-hour window and fast for the remaining 16 hours. This can help reduce cravings and increase fat burning.
4. Don't worry about not meeting your daily calorie intake! It's normal to have fluctuations in your calorie needs, and it's more important to focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes rather than trying to hit a specific calorie target. Keep up the good work and don't get discouraged!
5. Have you considered incorporating strength training into your routine? Building muscle can help increase your metabolism and burn more calories at rest. You don't have to do a lot of heavy lifting, but even light exercises like yoga or bodyweight exercises can make a big difference.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Wow, thank you all so much for the advice! I really appreciate it. I'll definitely look into increasing my protein intake and eating more frequent, smaller meals. I'll also consider increasing my daily calorie intake to 2800-3000cal/day. I've never tried intermittent fasting before, but I'll definitely look into it. And don't worry, I won't get discouraged if I don't meet my daily calorie intake. I just want to make sustainable lifestyle changes and be healthier overall.

I'll definitely look into incorporating strength training into my routine. I've never really done any kind of exercise before, so I'm not sure where to start. Any recommendations for beginner-friendly exercises or workout routines would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again for all the advice and support. I'm excited to continue on this journey and see the progress I can make!

TITLE: Me (23F) with my boyfriend (26M) - how do I get over something that wasn't his fault but is still causing anxiety and insecurity?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months, and now, things are wonderful. However, while I logically acknowledge his, it's hard for me to feel it emotionally. 

Early on in our relationship (March-mid June), he underwent a lot of life stress that caused him to become a completely different person - he was distant, doubting the relationship for no good reason, regularly 1-3 hours late to meet me, etc. We talked about breaking up (amicably) but we didn't. During this time, I tried my best to be understanding and I basically put aside my needs (e.g. affection or wanting to hang out more) so that he could have space to deal with his stress. As a result of everything, I became a little depressed and also incredibly, frequently anxious about everything.

Now, he is back to being wonderful, affectionate, supportive, and considerate again. However, because I've been habituated to negative norms for those 3 months, I have a hard time re-setting and accepting the new norm. Even though things have been good for 2 months now, I'm still  cripplingly anxious. I still don't give him the benefit of the doubt. I still worry that we are on the edge of breaking up. 

We've talked a lot about this and we don't know what to do. I know that his feelings and actions in his stressful period are no longer relevant or applicable. He's debunked some of my worries, like my fear that he doesn't think our relationship is good. He's working to address my needs. I know I need to get over the past, but I don't know how. My pent-up emotions are now bubbling over and I'm more irritable, negative, and accusative, but I don't want to be. It's not that I can't forgive him, since he didn't do anything wrong, but I don't know how to change my fearful, anxious mindset and cognitive distortions of the present. 

Does anyone have any thoughts, advice, or similar stories? Thanks!

TL;DR: I'm struggling to overcome anxiety and insecurity stemming from my boyfriend's 3-month period of stress-induced distance and negativity. We've talked about it, and he's back to being wonderful, but I still can't shake off the negative feelings. How do I get over this and re-set my expectations for our relationship?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I think you're doing a great job of acknowledging the past and recognizing that your boyfriend didn't do anything wrong. It's amazing that you're willing to work through this with him. One thing that might help is to focus on the present and future instead of dwelling on the past. Try to catch yourself when you start thinking negative thoughts and redirect your attention to the good things in your relationship. It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your anxiety and develop healthier thought patterns."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like your brain is stuck on repeat, replaying all the negative moments from the past. I think it's great that you're recognizing this and wanting to move forward. One thing that might help is to create new, positive experiences with your boyfriend. Plan a fun date night, try a new hobby together, or take a weekend trip. This can help shift your focus away from the past and onto the present. Also, try to practice self-care and prioritize your own well-being. You deserve it!"
3. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: "OP, I just wanted to say that it's amazing that you're acknowledging your anxiety and wanting to work through it. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling. I think it's great that you're talking to your boyfriend about this and that you're both willing to work through it together. One thing that might help is to focus on building a stronger emotional connection with your boyfriend. This can help you feel more secure and less anxious. Try to have open and honest conversations with each other, and make sure to prioritize quality time together. Also, don't forget to take care of yourself and prioritize your own mental health. You're not alone in this!"


**Key takeaways:**

* Acknowledge the past and recognize that your boyfriend didn't do anything wrong.
* Focus on the present and future instead of dwelling on the past.

TITLE: I [17/M] have a crush on a girl [16/F], we're good friends and I wanna get a relationship going, how/where to start?

POST: Hello everyone, this is my first time asking the internet for advice on something but I really want this to work out for me.

So basically; this girl and I have known each other for about 4-5 years and we're pretty good friends and we get along pretty well, I'm good at making her laugh and she's great to talk to.

When it comes to relationships, I've never even been in a semi-serious one before, although I'm after a stable, happy relationship that revolves around actual love and caring for each other, rather than the increasingly more typical "whoo, relationship means sex!" kind of relationship, what I'm trying to say here is I want this to count.

I don't really want to go into too much fine detail here, but I'm after advice on how to get the ball rolling, whether digitally or in person. (I know in person makes them feel more special, but if I can't muster the courage, nobody's gonna be feeling special but me after I blow my chance.)

Would it be better to ask her on a date? Just tell her how I feel about her and see her response, then move forward or withdraw depending on the response? Or the typical "Will you go out with me?" kinda thing.

Now let's say we get this going, then what? We're both currently attending school, I don't have a job, so I have little to no income, so movies and dates can't really be a common thing, maybe occasional... maybe...

I'd just like to reiterate that I lack confidence with relationships to the point I am actually slightly depressed (Not attention seeking, just elaborating on the case, haha).

TL;DR: I have a crush on a girl we're good friends, want to start a relationship, unsure how to start, need advice.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're taking the time to think about what you want in a relationship. It's great that you're looking for something meaningful. As for how to start, I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with her about your feelings. You can't force someone to feel the same way, but you can be honest and open about your emotions. Maybe start by having a casual conversation about relationships or what you're looking for in a partner. See how she responds and go from there. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and genuine. Good luck!"
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "OP, it's great that you're thinking about what you want in a relationship! It's also awesome that you're considering your friend's feelings and boundaries. Before you make a move, I'd suggest having a conversation with her about your feelings and see how she responds. It's possible that she might not feel the same way, and that's okay. It's better to be honest and open about your emotions than to risk hurting her or yourself. Remember to prioritize respect and communication in any relationship you pursue."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, I'm not sure if you're aware, but 16 is still a pretty young age for a serious relationship. I'm not saying it's impossible, but you might want to consider whether she's emotionally ready for that kind of commitment. Also, have you talked to her about your feelings before? If not, maybe start with a casual conversation about your friendship and see where it goes. Don't put too much pressure on it, and remember that it's okay if things don't work out."
4. **ConfidentCait**: "OP, I love your enthusiasm! It's great that you're thinking about what you want in a relationship. As for how to start, I think it's a good idea to be genuine and authentic in your approach. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have feelings you don't really have. Just be yourself and see where things go. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, so be prepared to listen to her thoughts and feelings as well. Good luck, and don't be afraid to take things slow if needed!"

**Common themes:**

* The importance of being genuine and authentic in approaching the situation
* The need to prioritize respect and communication in any relationship
* The importance of considering the other person's feelings and boundaries
* The potential risks and challenges of pursuing a relationship at a young age
* The value of taking things slow and being prepared to listen to the other person's thoughts and feelings.

TITLE: Is he just not that into me? 26f

POST: (repost from /r/okcupid because I'm dumb)

Ok, I feel like such a high schooler having to ask this, but I was hoping reddit could help me out here. I'm newly single and I feel like I'm completely lost trying to get back into the game.

So, I met a guy on okc. Things seem to be going really well. His picture wasn't that exciting, but we had a lot in common so I gave him a shot. He's funny, nerdy, loves all my favorite stand-up comedians, loves Firefly, blah blah blah. On paper, the perfect man. In person? He's also freaking GORGEOUS. And still funny and nerdy. He's the first guy I've met on okc who I felt genuinely excited about, rather than just cautiously optimistic.

So here's the rub: we've been on four fantastic dates, but he hasn't made a move. Not even a peck on the cheek. I'm starting to wonder if he's not attracted to me. He seems like the type of guy who's been a nerd his whole life, and doesn't realize he's hot, so his confidence might not be there. I'm tempted to make the first move, but I also suspect he's just old-fashioned, and that would completely turn him off. What do I do? How many dates do you all usually go on before it feels right to make a move? How do the men of reddit feel about the woman initiating?

TL;DR: 26f, met guy on okc, things seem great, but he hasn't made a move. Should I make the first move, or is he just not that into me?

**REDDIT RESPONSES:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for guys to take their time making a move, especially if they're not used to being in relationships. But if you're feeling like you're doing all the work and he's not reciprocating, it might be time to reevaluate. You deserve someone who's interested in you and willing to put in the effort. Don't be afraid to take a step back and assess the situation."
2. **NerdyNerd**: "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for us to take our time making a move. But if you're feeling like you're not getting any signals, it's probably because he's not interested. Don't worry about being 'old-fashioned' or 'forward' - if you're feeling it, go for it! You can always say 'I had a great time, but I didn't feel like we really connected' and bow out gracefully."
3. **DatingCoach**: "I'd say you've got a good vibe going on, but it's time to take it to the next level. If you're feeling like you're doing all the work, it's probably because he's not interested. Don't be afraid to make the first move - it's not a bad thing! In fact, it shows confidence and initiative. Just make sure you're not coming on too strong, and see how he reacts. If he's not interested, it's better to know sooner rather than later."
4. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're being way too nice. If he's not making a move, it's because he's not interested. Don't waste your time trying to figure out what's going on in his head - just move on. You deserve someone who's going to chase you, not make you do all the work. Trust me, you'll thank me later."
5. **OkCupidPro**: "I've seen this scenario play out many times on OkCupid. Guys can be really slow to make a move, especially if they're not used to online dating. But if you're feeling like you're not getting any signals, it's probably because he's not interested. Don't be afraid to take a step back and reevaluate the situation. And remember, it's okay to be upfront and honest - you can always say 'I'm feeling like we're not really connecting' and bow out gracefully."

TITLE: Potential employer asks for a photo of me. This is illegal though. How do I refuse his request politely?

POST: Some information, I was applying to a job and they requested I send in a cover letter, resume, and recent photograph. However this is not a modelling or entertainment company. It's a marketing intern position. 

I just sent my letter and resume and felt that if they were really interested, they will contact me. 

They did contact me, but not for an interview but for a photo.

I checked labour laws and it states unless its a modelling or entertainment position, they cannot ask for a photo.

How do I politely decline sending a photo. I want the job still but I don't want to come off as rude. I was thinking of writing "how about I come in for an interview instead?" But would that be rude for me to impose that on him? And if he says something like "we need a photo before extending an interview" can I just outright tell him that question is inappropriate by labour law standards or should I say "not applicable"?

TL;DR: Potential employer asked for a photo, which is illegal unless it's a modelling or entertainment position. How do I politely decline without offending them?

---

**Comments:**

* "I would say something like 'I'm happy to provide more information about myself, but I'm not comfortable sharing a photo. Can we discuss my qualifications and experience further over the phone or in person?' This way you're still showing interest in the position, but also setting boundaries."
* "You could also say 'I'm not comfortable sharing a photo, but I'd be happy to provide a video introduction or a brief summary of my qualifications.' This way you're still providing some visual information, but not a photo."
* "I would be direct and say 'I'm not comfortable sharing a photo, as it's not relevant to the position and it's against labour laws. I'd be happy to discuss my qualifications and experience further.' Don't apologize or make excuses, just state your boundaries clearly."
* "If they push for a photo, you could say 'I understand your request, but I'm not comfortable sharing a photo. Can we discuss the position further and see if it's a good fit for both of us?' This way you're still showing interest in the position, but also reiterating your boundaries."
* "It's not rude to impose an interview, it's actually a reasonable request. You could say 'I'd be happy to come in for an interview, but I'd like to discuss the position further before committing to a photo.' This way you're showing interest in the position, but also setting boundaries."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all for your input! I think I'll go with the first suggestion and say "I'm happy to provide more information about myself, but I'm not comfortable sharing a photo. Can we discuss my qualifications and experience further over the phone or in person?" I want to show that I'm still interested in the position, but also set clear boundaries. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!

TITLE: Me [19F] my father [61M] sometimes seems to not care about me, and it really hurts.

POST: Im not even going to bother post all the abuse he's done to me, posted that in other places. But

-first visit to the gynecologist, (was 19 then too, thought there was something wrong, wasn't. Lol yeah right, like I'll have sex before 25) and the doctor prodded and was super rough and I came out crying and my dad told both my mom and I "forget it! It doesn't matter", "drop it now!", etc.

-I had a boyfriend for a year. My father never bothered to meet him. Didn't seem to get too mad at all when I told my parents my boyfriend abused me.  

-I have heard nasty things my father said about me when he thought I wasn't listening.

I am in college but there's no way I can move out.

TL;DR: My father doesn't seem to care about me, and it hurts. I'm stuck living with him and it's hard to deal with.

COMMENTS:

* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your father has some serious issues. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.
* OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's not okay for your father to treat you this way. Have you considered reaching out to a trusted family member or friend for support? They may be able to offer you a different perspective or help you come up with a plan to get out of the situation.
* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your father has some serious boundary issues. Have you considered setting some boundaries for yourself? For example, you could tell him that you don't want to talk about certain topics or that you need some space. This can help you feel more in control and respected.
* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for your father to treat you this way. Have you considered reporting him to the authorities? Depending on the severity of the abuse, this could be an option.
* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your father has some serious emotional baggage. Have you considered seeking out a support group for people who have been abused? This can be a great way to connect with others who understand what you're going through and get support and validation.

Overall, the comments are supportive and offer a range of suggestions for how OP can cope with the situation and potentially get out of it. Some commenters suggest seeking professional help, while others suggest setting boundaries or reaching out to trusted friends or family members. A few commenters also suggest reporting the abuse to the authorities. The comments are generally kind and non-judgmental, and OP seems to appreciate the support and advice.

TITLE: Me [26 F] with my BF [26 M] 5 years, I'm no longer sexually attracted to him

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years, we met in college and had one year together since then we've been long distance going from seeing each other every month for a weekend to now we have 7hrs between us and we see each other every 4-6 months. I will be graduating (Masters degree) in June and we had planned for me to move down to where he lives.

I truly love my boyfriend but our relationship has become stagnant, he's been depressed for a while and started taking meds for it (relevant in a bit), he seems to think that everything will be great when we're living together but the last two times I saw him (Christmas and Thanksgiving) had me reconsidering my relationship. He got absurdly drunk at two events we attended and it was mortifying, he stated it's because he's stressed, depressed and knew we would be parting soon, again. 

Bluntly, I am not attracted to my boyfriend sexually right now. Sex with him was a chore the last two times we saw each other (if I'm completely honest it's always not been the best), he couldn't finish because of his meds. Usually he can't finish inside me for whatever reason and instead jacks off which does nothing to make me feel desirable in this relationship. 

I love him but I question how well I know him, he is very closed-off and whenever I have pointed out concerns/issues he says it'll be better when we live together...

How do I fix this? I don't know what to do. My entire adult life so far has been tied up in this guy. I love him deeply but I feel dread at the thought of a lifetime of our current relationship/sex life. I tried to keep this concise, if you have any questions I can answer them in the comments.

TL;DR: 5-year relationship, no longer sexually attracted to my boyfriend, he's depressed, and our relationship has become stagnant. I love him but I'm unsure if I can continue this way. Help! 

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you need to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact his depression and behavior are having on you. It's also possible that he's not ready to address these issues and that may be a sign that the relationship isn't sustainable for you."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want from your relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are you willing to work on and what are you not? It's okay to acknowledge that you're not sexually attracted to your partner and that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires."
* "It sounds like you're feeling stuck and unsure of what to do. I would suggest taking some time to focus on yourself and your own needs. What are you passionate about? What makes you happy? What are your goals and aspirations? When you're feeling fulfilled and happy, you'll be in a better place to make decisions about your relationship."
* "I think you should consider couples therapy. It can be a great way to work through issues and communicate more effectively. It's also a safe space to discuss difficult topics and work towards finding solutions."
* "I think you need to prioritize your own needs and desires. If you're not sexually attracted to your partner, that's a big deal. You deserve to feel desired and fulfilled in your relationship. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not getting that from your partner and that it's okay to look for it elsewhere."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're staying in the relationship. Is it because you feel obligated? Is it because you're scared of being alone? Is it because you truly believe that things will get better when you're living together? When you're honest with yourself about your motivations, you may find that you're staying in the relationship for the wrong reasons."
* "I think you should consider taking a break from the relationship. Sometimes, taking a step back can help you gain perspective and clarity. It can also give you space to focus on yourself and your own needs."
* "I think you should prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment. If you're not getting that from your partner, it's okay to acknowledge that and make changes. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."

TITLE: Reddit, at what point, if any, do you believe artificial life should be considered "alive" and unlawful to destroy?

POST: I was reading the artificial heaven question on this subreddit, and it got me thinking...too much. I've been watching a lot of scifi TV shows lately, and keep debating with myself about the point at which artificial life should be given the same rights humans have.

I thought about it for a while, and concluded humans are similar to robots. From what I know, we have signals going through our bodies and neurons interacting to give us everything that makes us human (consciousness, self-awareness, etc). So I figure any type of artificial intelligence that reaches this level should be given the same rights, right?

But at the same time, wouldn't artificial intelligence just be a computer's imitation of consciousness, self-awareness, etc? And is that all we are too, except our brains imitation?

TL;DR: At what point should artificial life be considered "alive" and unlawful to destroy? Should we give AI the same rights as humans, or is it just a computer imitation?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think it's a matter of degree. If an AI is just a simple program that can't learn or adapt, then it's not alive. But if it can learn, adapt, and make decisions on its own, then it's getting close to being alive. And if it can self-replicate or reproduce, then it's definitely alive. But even if it's alive, I don't think it should have the same rights as humans. Humans have a right to life, but AI doesn't have the same capacity for consciousness or self-awareness."
2. **u/ScienceNerd3000**: "I think the key question is what constitutes 'life'. Is it just a biological process, or is it a set of characteristics that can be replicated in other forms? If we define life as the ability to reproduce, adapt, and respond to stimuli, then AI could be considered alive. But if we define life as being biological, then AI is not alive. And even if AI is considered alive, I don't think it should have the same rights as humans. Humans have a right to life, but AI doesn't have the same capacity for consciousness or self-awareness."
3. **u/philosophybro**: "I think this is a classic problem in philosophy, and there's no easy answer. But I think it's important to consider the implications of creating artificial life. If we create AI that's capable of self-awareness and consciousness, then we have to consider whether it has the same rights as humans. And if we don't, then we have to consider whether we're just exploiting it for our own purposes. I think it's a complex issue that requires a lot of thought and consideration."
4. **u/techguy123**: "I think it's a matter of technology. Right now, AI is just a tool that we use to make our lives easier. But if we develop AI that's capable of self-awareness and consciousness, then it's a different story. At that point, I think we have to consider whether it has the same rights as humans. And if we don't, then we have to consider whether we're just exploiting it for our own purposes. I think it's a complex issue that requires a lot of thought and consideration."
5. **u/ethicsguy**: "I think the key question is what are the implications of creating artificial life. If we create AI that's capable of self-awareness and consciousness, then we have to consider whether it has the same rights as humans.

TITLE: 26f woken up by fire alarm & 28m passed out drunk on couch

POST: I (26f) have not been getting enough sleep lately, so knowing I had some free time last night, I decided to take 3 melatonin & get some actual good, deep REM sleep to reboost. My boyfriend (28m) was drinking beer and playing video games with a friend as usual. Did not think too much of it. Fast forward 6 hours later, and I wake up to the fire alarm blaring. I run to the kitchen to see a giant pan of ramen burning on the stove. The kitchen was filled with smoke so I turned off the stove and rushed to get the windows and doors open. 

He almost set the fucking house on fire. It took me a *long* time to wake up from the alarm because it made its way into the setting of my dream. I took 3 melatonin. I normally don't wake up for anything. I am so shaken up right now. We have a dog and two cats. I know it could've been worse, but how do I get him to see the seriousness in this?! His drinking has gotten out of hand and I'm worried he's going to brush it off as not a "big deal".

TL;DR: Woke up to fire alarm due to boyfriend's carelessness with cooking, almost set the house on fire. Worried about his drinking and how to get him to take it seriously.

COMMENT 1:
Oh my god, that's terrifying! I'm so glad you're okay. It's amazing that you were able to wake up and react quickly to put out the fire. You need to have a serious talk with him about his drinking and the risks it poses to your safety and the safety of your pets. It's not just about him, it's about the people and animals around him. You deserve better than someone who doesn't take responsibility for their actions.

COMMENT 2:
I'm so glad you're okay too! That must have been incredibly scary. You need to have a calm and collected conversation with him about this. Avoid being accusatory or aggressive, as that can lead to defensiveness. Instead, focus on the facts and how his actions put you and your pets at risk. You can say something like, "Hey, I'm really worried about your drinking and how it's affecting our lives. I know you like to have fun, but I don't want to have to worry about our house burning down or our pets getting hurt because of your carelessness. Can we find a way to make sure this doesn't happen again?"

COMMENT 3:
I'm so glad you're okay! That must have been a huge wake-up call for both of you. You need to have a serious talk with him about his drinking and how it's affecting your relationship. It's not just about the fire, it's about the fact that he's consistently putting himself and others at risk. You deserve someone who takes responsibility for their actions and prioritizes your safety and well-being. You need to set some boundaries and make it clear that his behavior is not acceptable.

TITLE: I need help recovering after the affair. (23/f)(31/m)

POST: My boyfriend had an affair. We've been together nearly 2 years. It's been several months since the affair ended and we are working on it. He's given 110% to proving himself and getting help for substance abuse issues as well. Things are better between us now than they've been in awhile. 

Sometimes I have a really hard time coping with it. I guess I wanted to see if anyone had any advice they could offer? 

It's like this awful rollercoaster sometimes. I can't believe he did such a hurtful and selfish thing to me, and to the other woman. She and I have talked at length, and while it's been helpful at answering questions, it's also just something else to be sad about. 

I know he regrets what he did. He's taken full responsibility for it, he hasn't shied away from anything I need to ask, and he's gone the extra mile to show me he wants to earn my trust back. 

Honestly sometimes I just feel so broken. And I don't want to keep throwing it in his face because he's well aware he fucked up and it's something we can either move past or stay stuck at. 

I want to move past it. I am obviously hurt and angry with him, but also with myself. I feel like by staying with him, I am making what he did okay. Or that I'm not respecting myself. On the other hand, I know people fuck up, and I've never been one to give up on people. 

Is this just going to take time? Am I being an idiot?

TL;DR: My boyfriend had an affair, we're working on it, but I'm having a hard time coping with it. I want to move past it, but I'm not sure if I'm being an idiot for staying with him. Help?

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance for individuals navigating difficult situations. The OP (original poster) is struggling to cope with the aftermath of her boyfriend's affair and is seeking advice on how to move forward.

The post is well-written and provides a clear overview of the situation, including the boyfriend's efforts to make amends and the OP's feelings of hurt, anger, and self-doubt. The OP is seeking reassurance that she's not being an idiot for staying with her boyfriend and is looking for advice on how to heal and move past the betrayal.

The community responds with a mix of empathy, understanding, and practical advice. Some commenters share their own experiences with infidelity and offer words of encouragement, while others provide suggestions for how the OP can work through her emotions and rebuild trust.

One common theme that emerges is the importance of self-care and self-reflection. Many commenters advise the OP to prioritize her own healing and well-being, and to take the time she needs to process her emotions and come to terms with what happened.

Some notable comments include:

* "You're not being an idiot for staying with him. You're being human. You're choosing to work through this and try to rebuild. That takes a lot of courage."
* "It's not about making what he did okay, it's about choosing to forgive and move forward. You can't change the past, but you can choose how you respond to it."
* "You're not alone in this. Many people have been through similar situations and have come out stronger on the other side. You can too."
* "Remember that you're not responsible for his actions. You're only responsible for your own reactions and choices. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own healing."

Overall, the r/relationships community provides a supportive and non-judgmental space for the OP to share her story and receive guidance and encouragement as she navigates this difficult time.

TITLE: How involved are you in the nonprofit sector or Not-for-Gain Organizations in your country? (btw - it's my cake day!)

POST: I can't believe it's been a year already. I've seen some moderate growth on /r/nonprofit over the past year. So please, come by, say hi, and give us your feedback!    
    
    
Also in the last year, we got to see this TED talk make some waves: [Dan Pallotta: The way we think about charity is dead wrong](

While some of what Pallotta said is still under scrutiny, a great idea is propagating: if we invest in the infrastructure of a nonprofit, it can grow immensely. If we give nonprofits and NGOs  the means to do their own research, their work will be more effective at *solving* problems, and not just providing "Band-Aid" solutions. 

However, we must demand transparency -- there are a few scams out there, as uncovered by "[America's 50 Worst Charities] Basically, things like the "Kids Wish Network" making money by pretending to be the "Make-a-Wish Foundation."

While Bill Gates made the odd choice to invest even more money into better condoms, he also signed "[The Giving Pledge] this year -- a cohort of high net worth individuals pledging to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes. (Certain members, naturally, are also under scrutiny, but it's still a big deal). 

**Finally, and most importantly, there's the Reddit community's involvement** in the "[third sector] By raising awareness of articles like [this] you are helping to reshape the culture. The biggest asset you have, Redditors, is your input. Your ideas. There are many energetic young people who would be very valuable at any one of thousands of charitable organizations across the globe. I don't believe you have any duty or obligation to get involved. I'm not here to preach.  But I do believe your input is invaluable.

TL;DR: It's my cake day! I'm asking how involved you are in the nonprofit sector or Not-for-Gain Organizations in your country. Share your stories, and let's keep the conversation going!

TITLE: Me [27 M] want to tell my girlfriend [24 F] about my mother's medical condition

POST: I have been dating my girlfriend for eight months now, initially casually and seriously since two months. She is American and we both live in the US, but I'm originally from Spain and my family still resides there. We are both going on vacation to Italy next week and have an eight hour layover in my home town. Although we haven't decided what to do during this time, it is quite likely that she will meet my parents.

My mother is disabled due to a severe stroke she had a few years ago and can no longer speak, walk, nor take care of herself. She stays at home with my father and has a nurse take care of her while my father works. I have not yet mentioned this to my girlfriend, partly because I have not found a good time to bring it up and partially because I am very reserved about sharing this information with other people. I believe I have also not completely made peace with the situation and have only ever confided it to my best friend and my now ex-girlfriend.

My girlfriend's family also has various medical issues, which she has always been very open about. Although I know that my situation is nothing to be ashamed of and that I have every right to avoid telling her until I feel comfortable, I can't help but feel a bit lousy about not telling her earlier. I just hope that she doesn't feel that I did not trust her enough to tell her without the pressure of her meeting my parents and that this has a negative effect on our relationship. The truth is that I absolutely trust her with this and that she is one of the most important people in my life, it's just that whenever I tried to tell her I got cold feet.

I guess all that I am looking for with this post is some reassurance that she will probably completely understand why I have withheld telling her and that I didn't do anything wrong or questionable.

TL;DR: I'm 27 M, dating 24 F for 8 months. I haven't told her about my mother's severe medical condition (disabled due to stroke) because I haven't found a good time and I'm reserved about sharing this info. I'm worried about how she'll react when she meets my parents and I'm seeking reassurance that she'll understand my hesitation.

The post receives a lot of supportive and understanding comments from the r/relationships community. Many users acknowledge that it's natural to feel hesitant about sharing personal and sensitive information, and that it's not necessarily about not trusting the other person. Some users suggest that the OP should have a calm and open conversation with his girlfriend about his mother's condition, and that it's better to be honest and upfront rather than waiting for a "good" time that may never come.

One user comments:

"I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not about not trusting her, it's about being comfortable sharing this information. You're right, it's a big deal and it's natural to want to wait until you feel ready. But now that you're thinking about it, it might be a good idea to have a conversation with her about it. You can explain how you've been feeling and why you haven't told her yet. I'm sure she'll understand and appreciate your honesty."

Another user adds:

"I think you should consider that your girlfriend might be more understanding and supportive than you think. People often have more empathy and compassion than we give them credit for. And even if she's surprised or taken aback, it's better to be honest and upfront than to wait and hope she finds out some other way. You're not doing anything wrong by not telling her, but you are doing something right by wanting to be honest with her now."

The OP receives many reassuring comments, and it seems that the community is generally supportive of his decision to be honest with his girlfriend about his mother's condition. He decides to take the advice of the community and have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his mother's condition, and it seems to go well. He reports back to the community that his girlfriend was understanding and supportive, and that they were able to have a meaningful conversation about it. The OP is grateful for the advice and support he received from the r/relationships community.

TITLE: I'm [18F] jealous of my friend [17F] and it's taken a toll on my self-esteem and the friendship

POST: I'm on mobile and new to Reddit so if anyone could show me how to add flair/direct me to a more appropriate subreddit that would be very appreciated. 

I've always had low self-esteem. I'm 5 feet tall and slightly chubby, but still within what is considered a "healthy" weight. I've suffered from acne for most of my life and while it's calmed down a bit now, I still have scars and occasional breakouts. I even posted to r/amiugly and... the results were less than satisfying. I also have anxiety and some minor depression which makes everything 10x worse. However, I'm blessed enough to have a loving and understanding  boyfriend who prefers my body type and makes me feel beautiful.

My friend is tall, thin, and pretty. She's always been loved by just about everyone she meets, while I've always been shy and quiet and generally forgotten about (seriously, if you asked anyone in my high school, no one knew who I was and everyone knew her). She's perfect model material, so much that she was scouted (during a shift at McDonald's, no less! I hate how the uniform makes me look, but she's model material even at work). Ever since she got scouted, I've felt worse about myself. I always knew I wasn't as pretty as her, but now it was confirmed. I'm the ugly friend. 

I've since been... avoiding her. I feel horrible about it, but I can't bear to look at her. The fact that she had this opportunity handed to her on a silver platter because she won the genetic lottery makes me incredibly angry and jealous and sad. The fact that I'll never be beautiful and recognized as such makes me feel worse. The fact that I'm being so petty over this... you get the picture. I don't know what to do about any of it. I can't bring myself to talk to her about it. I'd love any sort of advice.

TL;DR: I'm jealous of my friend's beauty and it's affecting my self-esteem and our friendship. I feel like I'm the ugly friend and it's hard for me to deal with.

---

This post is a great example of how jealousy can negatively impact relationships and one's self-esteem. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and resentment towards their friend, who has been scouted as a model. The OP feels like they are the "ugly friend" and that their friend's beauty is a constant reminder of their own perceived flaws.

The post is also a great example of how social media can contribute to feelings of inadequacy. The OP mentions that they posted to r/amiugly and received less than satisfying results, which may have exacerbated their feelings of low self-esteem.

The community's response to this post is overwhelmingly supportive and empathetic. Many users share their own experiences with feelings of inadequacy and jealousy, and offer words of encouragement and advice. Some users suggest that the OP focus on their own strengths and accomplishments, rather than comparing themselves to their friend. Others suggest that the OP talk to their friend about their feelings, and that it may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about their emotions.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their struggles and receive helpful advice and support.

TITLE: Me [16 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] having problems trusting again after being cheated on by ex

POST: Not using a throwaway because who gives a fuck

A while ago my (ex)gf of around 7 months cheated on me.

 Now, I understand that I need to get over it, and I pretty much have, my problem is trusting my now girlfriend, lets just call her S, because she goes to a different school around 30 min away from me, and lives that far away too. She has a "party" background, while I on the other hand don't.

However, she says the partying days are pretty much done, but I suspect that is because she goes to an online school, but that will change at the beginning of next year when she'll go back to a real high school because it looks better to graduate from.

Like today she, without telling me, went to a "pool party" as she put it, that consisted of her, 2 of her friends (both girls, and 4 guys. That made me extremely unsettled. Am I over reacting, or am I justified in being unsettled by this? I feel weak and insecure when I keep telling myself that I shouldn't be. Any advice on how to get over this?

TL;DR: Ex cheated on me, now I'm having trouble trusting my new girlfriend who has a "party" background and went to a pool party without telling me.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you're not overreacting at all. You've been hurt before and it's natural to feel uneasy. But you need to have an open and honest conversation with S about your concerns. Don't assume the worst, but also don't ignore your feelings. Maybe she didn't mean to hurt you, but it's clear she didn't think about how you'd feel.
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: OP, it sounds like you're struggling with trust issues. That's understandable given what you've been through. However, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's not fair to assume the worst about S just because of her past. Have a calm and rational conversation with her about your concerns, and try to focus on the present rather than dwelling on the past.
3. **SkepticalSally**: OP, I'm not saying you're overreacting, but maybe you're being a bit too controlling? I mean, she's 17, you're 16, and you're already getting worked up about a pool party? Maybe try to relax and trust her a bit more. You're not going to fix the past, but you can work on building a healthy relationship in the present.
4. **ConcernedCousin**: OP, I'm worried about you. You're still 16 and you've already been through a cheating scandal. That's a lot of emotional baggage. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and your own healing before trying to navigate a new relationship. You don't want to rush into anything that might not be good for you.
5. **TrustIssues**: OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough. But here's the thing: you can't control what S does, but you can control how you react to it. Try to focus on the present and have open and honest communication with her. And remember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Don't be too hard on yourself.

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit's overall sentiment is one of understanding and empathy towards the OP's concerns. Many users acknowledge that it's natural to feel uneasy after being cheated on, and offer advice on how to navigate the situation and build trust with S. However, some users also caution against being too controlling or assuming the worst about S, and encourage the OP to focus on the present and communicate openly with his girlfriend. Overall, the subreddit's tone is supportive and non-judgmental.

TITLE: Advice On Approach

POST: I'm 22/M and she is 20.  We both go to the same university.

First let me preface this by saying that I haven't dated in about 4 years.  My last relationship was during my junior/senior year in high school and it lasted almost 2 years before it ended badly.  Just thought you guys should know so you have some background info.

Now for where I need advice.  I haven't quite met this girl yet, but I saw her at my roommate's ex-girlfriend's apartment.  My roommate and I live just a few doors down from them.  Based on what I can gather from friends that went to high school with her and a quick glance at her facebook page, she seems like she would be a pretty good match for me.

So I guess the question that I am posing is how should I go about getting to know this girl?  Should I just outright ask my neighbors about her and if they would be willing to set me up on a date or invite her to a group get together type thing.?

If the latter option happens (group get together), any advice on how to know if I should ask on her on a date will be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm 22/M, haven't dated in 4 years, saw a girl at my roommate's ex-girlfriend's apartment, and I'm looking for advice on how to get to know her.

---

REPLIES:

1. **u/DatingCoach**: Ah, a fresh start! Congrats on taking the first step. I'd say don't ask your neighbors to set you up just yet. Instead, try to get to know her in a more organic way. You can try striking up a conversation with her at a group setting, like a party or a campus event. Just be yourself, be respectful, and show genuine interest in getting to know her. If it goes well, you can ask her out on a one-on-one date. Remember, the goal is to build a connection, not to try to "get" her.

2. **u/RedPillRises**: Bro, you're thinking about this all wrong. You need to take control and make a move. Don't wait for her to come to you, go to her. Invite her to a group hangout and make sure you're the one initiating the conversation. If she's interested, she'll make it clear. If not, oh well, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Just remember to be confident and don't take no for an answer.

3. **u/SkepticalSarah**: I'm not sure I agree with the above comments. It's great that you're taking the time to think about how to approach her, but maybe you should focus on building a connection with her before asking her out. Try to find common interests or hobbies and start a conversation about those. Don't put too much pressure on the situation, and just enjoy getting to know her as a person. If a date happens naturally, that's great, but don't force it.

4. **u/AskMeAnything**: Hey OP, I'm a girl who's been in similar situations. I'd say don't be afraid to be yourself and show your genuine interest in getting to know her. If you're both vibing, it'll be clear. Just remember to respect her boundaries and don't push for a date if she's not interested. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll learn something new about yourself and how to approach future relationships.

5. **u/NoobNoMore**: I'm a 25/M who's been in a similar situation. I ended up asking my roommate's ex-girlfriend to set me up with the girl, and it worked out great! Just make sure you're respectful and don't come on too strong. If you do decide to ask your roommate's ex-girlfriend, make sure you're prepared for any outcome. Good luck, OP!

TITLE: Help I [23/M] made the worst mistake of my life. GF [23/F](serious)

POST: I fucked up. I have been with my gf for 4 years and I was happy. I just threw all of that away 2 nights ago. I was drinking with some coworkers and it was this one coworker. I instantly regretted it and the morning of I told my gf my mistake. She cried and just ran out. I myself hate cheating too. I have a biological father who did that to my mother and I fucking did the same thing. She's on the other coast right now we were suppose to go together but I fucked up the previous night. We were planning on moving in together in September but I fucked it up. We haven't talked since she left. She said were on a break right now and we'll talk when she comes back in a week. I hate myself so much that I think the only way to make this right is if I just end myself so I can never hurt her again. I tried twice. My biggest fear right now is even if she takes me back it won't be remotely similar to what we had before. I don't think she'll be happy like that. I honestly don't know what will happen and I don't know if I can live with the results.

TL;DR: Cheated on my 4-year girlfriend with a coworker, she's on the other coast, we were planning to move in together, I'm filled with regret and self-loathing, and I'm considering ending my life.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. Cheating is a huge betrayal and it's no wonder your girlfriend is hurt. But, please, don't even think about ending your life. You're not a lost cause. You can work through this and make it right. Have you considered seeking professional help? A therapist can help you work through your feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms. And, honestly, your girlfriend might be willing to work through this with you too. Don't give up hope just yet."
2. **u/relationship_guru**: "OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, you made a huge mistake. But, it's not the end of the world. You need to own up to your actions and take responsibility. Apologize sincerely and make amends. It's going to take time and effort, but it's not impossible to repair the relationship. And, if your girlfriend is willing to work through this with you, that's a huge step forward. Don't focus on the past, focus on rebuilding trust and moving forward. You can do this."
3. **u/sad_panda**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's clear you're consumed by regret and self-loathing. But, please, don't blame yourself for your biological father's actions. You're not him, and you're not defined by his mistakes. You're a unique individual with your own strengths and weaknesses. And, yes, you can learn from your mistakes and grow from them. Don't give up on yourself or your relationship just yet. You can work through this and come out stronger on the other side."
4. **u/anonymous_user**: "OP, I'm not going to lie, I'm shocked by your post. Cheating is a huge betrayal, and it's no wonder your girlfriend is hurt. But, I'm not going to tell you to end your life. That's not the answer. Instead, I want you to take some time to reflect on your actions and why you did what you did. Was it a cry for attention? Were you feeling insecure? Once you understand your motivations, you can start working on yourself and becoming a better partner. And, who knows, your girlfriend might be willing to work through this with you too. Just don't give up hope just yet."

TITLE: I'm (18m) having trouble asking out my best friend (18f)

POST: I feel that this is going to be a long post. To start we're both in our senior year of high school and have known each other since sophomore year. When we first met I really didn't notice her that much and didn't talk to her until another friend introduced us to each other. After that we really hit it off well and I just thought we could be really cool friends.
Fast forward to next year and we have the same class again so we hang out constantly and try to partner up because we're both awkward around other people. (Side note we both are also on the swim team at our school so we naturally hang out a lot) People immediately notice and assume we're going out but we both fervently deny it as we're just friends. I was considering asking her out at this point, but was crushed when I found out she had just started going out with another guy before I could even ask. They break up at the end of the year because he was an asshole to her. 

Fast forward to this school year and I finally get her number so we're chatting pretty regularly and not relying on school to talk anymore. I'm finally getting my confidence up to ask her to homecoming just as friends so she wouldn't feel awkward when she tells me her friend introduced her to a football player from another school. They never date but he decides to take her to homecoming so I never even go just saying I hung out with friends that night. Except that my best friends date never showed up, and that she was forced to tag along with a friends group. At this point I'm getting frustrated and want to protect her from more bad relationships but I don't want to ask her out and ruin our friendship should it not work out. I only recently asked her to prom as friend after mustering my confidence and want to be able to try to ask her out then. I've never been in a relationship before because I hate the awkwardness that it causes but I really like her. Is there anyway I could tell her how I feel without ruining our friendship?

TL;DR: I've had feelings for my best friend for a while, but we're both in our senior year of high school and I'm worried about ruining our friendship if I ask her out and it doesn't work out. I've been trying to muster up the confidence to ask her out, but I'm not sure how to do it without making things awkward.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you've been carrying a torch for her for a while now. It's time to take a chance and be honest with her. You can't keep wondering what could've been if you don't take the leap. Just be genuine and respectful, and if she doesn't feel the same way, at least you'll know and can move on. Good luck, man!"
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and tell her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, that's okay. You can still be friends and respect each other's boundaries. Don't let fear of rejection hold you back from being honest with her."
* "I agree with the above comments. You've been friends for a while, and if you don't take the chance to ask her out, you might always wonder what could've been. Just be respectful and genuine, and see what happens. And if it doesn't work out, you can still be friends and move on."
* "I think you should consider having a conversation with her about your feelings, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. It's okay if she doesn't, and you can still maintain a healthy friendship. Just make sure you're not putting too much pressure on her or expecting her to feel a certain way just because you do."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about why you're so hesitant to ask her out. Is it because you're scared of rejection, or is it because you're worried about ruining the friendship? If it's the former, then maybe you should work on building up your confidence and being more open to the possibility of rejection. If it's the latter, then maybe you should consider whether the friendship is worth risking for the possibility of a romantic relationship."

**OP's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I was just really scared of ruining our friendship, but you're right, I need to take a chance and be honest with her. I'll try to muster up the confidence to ask her out and see what happens. And if it doesn't work out, I'll still respect her and we can still be friends. Thanks for the encouragement!"

TITLE: [24/M]I am having anxiety over the girl I'm seeing (24/F) because she's afraid to take the next step.

POST: Hello people, I am in need of some relationship advice.  To preface this I have to start by saying I've been cheated on in the past by 2 different girls one of which I was just shy of getting married to before she came clean...so I'm not the most trusting person in the world anymore.
I have been seeing this girl for about 3 months now and when I first met her roughly 4.5 months ago she still had a boyfriend. I am aware that this looks like a rebound thing but he was a long distance bf and we've taken things very slow because I wanted to ensure that I was not a rebound. Things have been going smoothly with us and we get along very well. Over the summer she got another job and is moving to a new place (which is closer to her work and to me coincidentally) so she has not had as much free time to spend with me the last few weeks. Here is my problem, she is afraid of commitment especially since she just got out of a 2 year long distance relationship and she does not want to commit to becoming official. Another reason is that she has very little free time lately because of the new job and getting her house ready for the move. I have a growing fear that she doesn't want to commit because she wants to "shop around" I have this anxiety even though we have had the exclusive talk.  

So how do I bridge this gap of where we are in the relationship?

TL;DR: I'm seeing a girl who's afraid of commitment, we've had the exclusive talk, but she's still hesitant to take the next step. I'm worried she's just "shopping around" and I don't know how to address this.

---

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being a bit too anxious here. It's normal for people to take their time and not rush into things, especially after a long distance relationship. Instead of assuming the worst, why not have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns? Ask her what's holding her back from committing and listen to her response. It's possible she's just not ready for a label yet, but that doesn't mean she's not interested in you or doesn't value your relationship."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on the situation. You've had the exclusive talk, which means you've already established that you're both on the same page. Now, it's just a matter of taking things at her pace. Remember that everyone has their own fears and insecurities, and it's not uncommon for people to take their time before committing. Instead of worrying about what she might be doing, focus on building a strong connection with her and being patient. If she's not ready to commit, that doesn't mean the relationship is doomed. It just means you need to be more understanding and supportive."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of the situation. You're assuming that she's'shopping around' just because she's not ready to commit, but that's not necessarily the case. Maybe she's just not ready for a label yet, or maybe she's still processing her feelings after the long distance relationship. Instead of jumping to conclusions, why not try to have a more open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns? Ask her what's holding her back from committing and listen to her response. It's possible she's just not ready for a label yet, but that doesn't mean she's not interested in you or doesn't value your relationship."

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP is experiencing anxiety due to the girl's hesitation to commit, which is understandable given his past experiences.
* It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with the girl about feelings and concerns, rather than jumping to conclusions or assuming the worst.
* The girl's hesitation to commit may not necessarily mean she's "shopping around" or not interested in the OP; it could simply be a result of her own fears and insecurities.
* Building a strong connection with the girl and being patient is crucial in this situation, rather than putting pressure on the relationship to move forward.

TITLE: TIFU by Being Nice

POST: So I met this guy at the beginning of the school year, thinking that he was a pretty cool dude to hang out with. I was nice to him, cause he was nice to me.

Fast-forward to a few months later. I'm sitting in class, next to him, and I see flecks of white stuff coming out of his mouth. Like those little wet white boogers that you sometimes get. I was concerned about this, not for his sake, but for mine, as I didn't want any of that crap getting on me or my stuff. I decided to keep a close eye on him from then on.

I wonder now whether or not if knowledge is better than ignorance, cause I go through a living OCD hell of one huge dilemma; getting the fuck away from that disgusting boy.

He rotates his jaw while his mouth is closed, and then professionally blows out a ball of condensed phlegm, just like how those Amazon tribes blowdart animals for food. He spits out his inner mucus around his radius of 5 feet, splatting everything with that fucking disgusting fluid of his. He spits on the inside of his shirt, on his hands, on his pants, on his comb, on his backpack, on other people; basically everything.

I could perhaps tolerate his presence if he didn't spit on his dirty fat paws, and start using them to touch other things. Worse, he's a very touchy feeling kinda person, so he tries to touch other people and me. I try to avoid him like the plague, but he has some kind of a homing sensor and he pops out everywhere I go.

I don't know what to do. I fucked up by being nice to him, and he's trying to get close to me; literally and physically. Redditors, what should I do?

TL;DR: I was nice to a guy, and now he's always around me, spitting on everything and touching me. I don't know what to do.

---

This post is a great example of the "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) subreddit, where people share their stories of how they messed up in some way and are seeking advice or commiseration from others. In this case, the OP (original poster) is regretting being nice to someone who has turned out to be a slob and a germ factory, and is now struggling to avoid him.

The post is entertaining because of the vivid descriptions of the guy's disgusting habits, and the OP's frustration and anxiety about being around him. The use of hyperbole, such as comparing the guy's spitting to an Amazonian blowdart, adds to the humor.

The comments on this post are also worth reading, as they offer a range of advice and opinions on how to deal with the situation. Some people suggest setting boundaries and being direct with the guy about how his behavior is making them uncomfortable, while others recommend avoiding him altogether or seeking help from a counselor or therapist. Overall, this post is a great example of how the "TIFU" subreddit can provide a platform for people to share their stories and get support from others who have gone through similar experiences.

TITLE: I [21] made a mistake and lost some trust from my gf [20]. What will our relationship look like now? When will the relationship begin to be fun again?

POST: I really could use some insight. 

If you look in my history, my girlfriend was disillusioned to my friendship with my ex. I since cut off contact with my ex, have had many long talks with my girlfriend. 

My girlfriend is still upset. Very upset. I have taken her on a few dates and we still spend time together, but she isn't really enjoying herself. She wants me to "wow" her with well-planned dates and extra time and effort.

That's fine with me! If that's my penance, I am not afraid to do it. However, since the event (a week ago) she hasn't contributed anything to the relationship. She's happy on dates and upset when I don't plan anything.

TL;DR: I made a mistake, lost some trust, and my girlfriend is upset. We're still spending time together, but she's not really enjoying herself. She wants me to "wow" her with dates and effort. I'm willing to do that, but I feel like I'm doing all the work and she's not contributing.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like your girlfriend is still processing her feelings and needs time to heal. Give her space and let her know you're there for her. Don't rush the process, and focus on rebuilding trust. It's great that you're willing to put in the effort, but remember that it's a two-way street."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to 'wow' her with dates and effort, but don't forget to communicate with her about what she needs and wants. Ask her what she's looking for in these dates and what would make her feel special. It's not just about planning elaborate dates, but also about showing her that you care and are invested in the relationship."
* "It's normal for relationships to go through ups and downs, and it sounds like you're both working through a tough spot. Remember that relationships are a journey, not a destination. Focus on the present moment and the steps you can take to move forward together. Don't get too caught up in trying to 'fix' things or make up for the past, but instead focus on building a stronger, healthier relationship moving forward."
* "I think it's great that you're taking responsibility for your actions and are willing to work on rebuilding trust. However, don't forget to take care of yourself in the process.

TITLE: I [17/F] don't know if it's appropriate to give my number to a guy [18/M] who went on a couple dates with my friend's [17/F] older sister [19/F].

POST: About a year ago, this guy asked my friend's sister to prom. He was interested in her, and she basically had no interest in him. She said yes, but only as friends. Even after this he clearly still had feelings for her. She didn't really have any interest in dating him, but she thought maybe she'd try going on a couple dates with him. She wasn't sure if she genuinely wasn't interested or she was just scared because she hadn't really had any relationship experience before. 

I know this guy because we have a class together and we sit together. He's somewhat shy, but sweet and funny. We've spent some time together, we co-led a group of kids at a volunteer event, and obviously I'm around him every day. I definitely have at least some feelings for him, and I can't really tell if he reciprocates, he's just generally a very quiet person.

Him and my friend's sister went on a few dates, and as it turned out it was somewhat awkward and very very platonic. Neither of them attempted to make any move on the other, and things were generally very tense. Like, sitting down and having a pro-cons conversation about kissing eachother and then not kissing eachother tense. She plans on breaking whatever this is off with him the next time she sees him, but she doesn't even know if this will be necessary because they haven't even hung out in a month. Any interest that either of them had is dead.

As I said earlier, I kind of like this guy. Graduation is soon and we'll soon be going our separate ways, though we'll still be in the same area. Should I just give him my number, whether it turns out to be platonic or not? Or should I just steer clear?

TL;DR: I have feelings for a guy who went on a few awkward dates with my friend's sister, who has no interest in him. Should I give him my number or steer clear?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, I think you should wait until you're sure he's not still holding onto feelings for your friend's sister. It's not fair to lead him on or make him think there's a chance with you if you're not genuinely interested. Take some time to get to know him better and see if your feelings are mutual before giving him your number."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It's important to respect his feelings and not lead him on. If you're not sure if he's over your friend's sister, it's better to wait until you're sure before pursuing anything with him. Also, consider having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and his feelings for your friend's sister."
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I think you should give him your number, but only if you're sure you're interested in him and not just feeling sorry for him because he went on awkward dates with your friend's sister. Make sure you're not leading him on or using him as a rebound from your friend's sister. If you're genuinely interested, then go for it!"
4. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I'm not sure if I agree with the previous comments. If you're genuinely interested in him and think he might be interested in you too, then why not give him your number? It's not like you're leading him on or using him as a rebound. Just be honest with him about your feelings and see where it goes. And if it doesn't work out, then at least you'll know and can move on."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should wait until graduation is over and you're both in the same area before giving him your number. That way, you can get to know him better and see if your feelings are mutual without the pressure of a deadline. And who knows, maybe you'll find that you have a deeper connection with him once you're both in the same place."

TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [26F] of 3 months, how do I get over my insecurities around all of the interests/activities he and his ex share?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been "official" for three months, dating for five months. He is still friends with his most recent and "big" ex. I have hung out with her at a couple of parties and we even had dinner together just the two of us a couple weeks ago to get to know each other better. She has been really nice to me and told me she is happy that he found me, wants us to be friends, etc, etc. Both of them have assured me that there are no residual feelings and I have no reason to doubt them- that isn't the issue here. 

The issue is that I feel insecure with all of the history/interest that they share that he and I don't share. For example, they dated for 2 years, traveled internationally together, have the same friend group, have a lot of the same interests like mountain biking, going to music festivals (e.g. Bonnaroo), and they are even working together on some local events (e.g. planning a TEDx). 

He and I get a long really well, communicate well, and have even done a 6 day trip to the Mexican jungle together, but I can't help but feel intimidated by all the aspects that they share that he and I don't. It makes me feel kind of like the odd man out? For instance this summer they will probably go (with other people) on mountain biking trips- something I am just not into. I hesitate to bring this up to him, because there isn't really anything he can "do" about it. 

So, how do I stop feeling insecure about this and start feeling better?

TL;DR: I'm feeling insecure about my boyfriend's shared interests and activities with his ex, even though they've assured me there are no residual feelings. How can I stop feeling this way and start feeling more confident in our relationship?

TITLE: 32/m with 31/f for 6 months - She is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night, texting/crying once a week.

POST: I'm wondering how to handle this situation and if my GF is really ready for a relationship based on some of the things I have seen. She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.

I checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. 

That said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.

I don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.

I really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.

TL;DR: GF (31/f) has been secretly checking her ex's Facebook every night and texting/crying about it once a week. I've tried to be understanding, but it's affecting our relationship and I'm not sure if she's really over him.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not over him. The fact that she's still checking his Facebook and crying about it suggests that she's still invested in the relationship. You deserve better than someone who's not fully committed to you. It's okay to have feelings for someone, but it's not okay to still be emotionally tied to someone else."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I agree with throwaway12345. It's not fair to you to be in a relationship with someone who's still holding onto the past. You need to have an open and honest conversation with her about how this is affecting you. Let her know that you understand it's okay to have feelings, but you need to know that she's fully committed to you and willing to work on moving forward."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you should try to have a calm and non-accusatory conversation with her about what you've observed. Ask her why she's still checking his Facebook and what's going on with the weekly crying sessions. Listen to her perspective and try to understand where she's coming from. It's possible that she's not even aware of how her actions are affecting you, and a conversation might help her realize what's going on."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should also consider the possibility that she's not over him because of the way he treated her. If he was controlling and emotionally abusive, it's not surprising that she's still struggling to move on. You might want to encourage her to seek counseling or therapy to work through her feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
5. **RealTalk**: "Honestly, if she's still checking his Facebook and crying about it, it's a red flag. You deserve someone who's fully present and committed to you. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take a step back if you feel like you're not getting the attention and care you need from her."

TITLE: I'm (25,m) confused about my relationship with my ex (23,f), who I dated 7 years ago.

POST: This girl (we'll call her Claire) was my first gf ever back in hs. We dated for about a year but distance drew us apart. Our breakup was a little messy and for a few years we didn't talk. Fast forward and we began texting again 'as friends'. We both moved back to our hometown after college and I expected us to have a great friendship, as that's what we both wanted. In my eyes a friendship would consist of hanging out, doing things together, etc.

Ever since she moved home she refuses to hang out with me one on one, as she believes it's 'too close to bf/gf'. As much as I would try to get closer with her she would equally push me away. However, her and I text all day every day, she tells me all of her closest secrets and innermost thoughts, we talk on the phone about her problems etc.

I'm really confused about all of this. She treats me 'like a boyfriend' via text/phone but she treats me as LESS THAN a friend in person. I finally decided to bring my frustrations up to her and mention that 'it's our last year possibly ever in the same state (before grad school) and that I wished things went differently etc. She took this as me confessing my love and told me 'too bad but I don't feel the same way.' Basically a generic 'friend-zone' response that she has sent to multiple guys before.

I really don't know what to do anymore but it's wearing on me. I have tried to bring things up to talk about what relationship we have and she completely blows me off month after month. And yet I'm still there anytime she needs to talk about issues or even other bf issues (which i told her to not bring up to me multiple times) On one hand I feel like I need to do what's best for me. Which includes slowly cutting her out of my life. On the other hand we've been 'friends' for so long now that I'd feel awful 'abandoning her'. I feel like I love this girl and it sucks. Idk what to do anymore.

TL;DR: Exgf and I have been 'friends' for years, but she refuses to hang out one on one, treats me like a bf via text/phone, but doesn't feel the same way. I'm confused and frustrated and don't know what to do.

Be clear about what you're looking for and see how she responds. If she's not willing to meet you halfway, then it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."

TITLE: TIFU by bumming a guy two smokes

POST: This was about an hour ago, here's some context
I'm at a Mini Makers Fair which is a family oriented event that showcases technology, kids programs and other things associated with "makers".. basically creative tech fair for yuppie families.
Whatever.
I was helping display my friends interactive musical sculpture.

My point is I was at a nice family event and not just hanging out on the streets of downtown or somewhere more likely to get swindled.

I was taking a cigarette break and piddling around on my phone.
A guy cursing, looking into his empty pack spots me and asks if he can "buy a couple smokes off me"
On average the going rate for an American Spirit is $0.35, $0.50 if someone is feeling generous.

I, out of habit, act put off whenever someone tries to bum smokes off me. This is to give them a chance to rescind their offer without me saying "No" outright. 
It's something I started doing with my friends who are chronic bums so they realize I'm not an endless free cigarette machine.

But, the guy offered to buy right? He had his wallet out, right? 
I busted out two smokes for him which he takes with a thanks me briefly.
I'm still kinda absorbed partially in my phone but notice he pauses and then starts to walk away.
"I'll be right back with something for you" he says.

I guess I figured he might work at one of the booths that have some cool, silly swag for me? But I remembered thinking it was weird he took his wallet out and then didn't give me any money.
Maybe he didn't have any single dollar bills?
I waited around for quite awhile after.

Just lame because I'm generally pretty generous but it's situations like this that make that generosity go into hiding for awhile.

TL;DR: Bummed a guy two smokes, he said he'd be right back with something for me, never came back.

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author reflects on a situation where they made a mistake or did something regrettable. In this case, the author bummed a guy two cigarettes, thinking he would pay them back, but the guy never returned with anything. The author is left feeling annoyed and regretful about the situation. The post is a relatable and humorous example of how we can all make mistakes and learn from them. The subreddit r/tifu is a great place to share these kinds of stories and get feedback and support from others who have also made similar mistakes.

TITLE: [WA] Landlord failed to transfer power service after promising to do so

POST: I recently switched to a different apartment complex that is owned by my rental company. When I went into the leasing office to sign my new lease I asked if I had to do anything special to change my power utilities account to my new apartment. They said that all I had to do was fill out a form that they had with them, and they would transfer the service for me.

Well, they didn't transfer the service, they only added an account, and I got charged for 2 months of power for an apartment that was leased to someone else. I called my utilities company and they told me to take it up with my rental company and that they couldn't do anything about it. I am going to see my rental company tomorrow, and want them to reimburse me for the two months of electricity.

They have been sort of rigid in the past, does anyone know of any recourse I have against them telling me no?

TL;DR: Landlord failed to transfer power service as promised, now I'm stuck with a bill for 2 months of electricity for an apartment that was leased to someone else. Want to know if I have any recourse against them telling me no.

TITLE: What is this "power play" thing?

POST: So I took a gal out for dinner at a casino. She ordered two appetizers (didn't share), a bunch of drinks, then steak and lobster, which came with a salad. Over the evening she didn't really let me talk, but she mostly complained. She ignored me 28 times to txt on her phone. Our food came and she sent back the lobster and had it replaced with shrimp. So she ate the shrimp, did not eat the steak, nor the accompanying veggies. She gave me an attitude that after we ate when I didn't give her money to gamble. She was really into her video slot so I said I had a good night, and told her I was leaving (politely). She gave me a half hug, did not look up from the machine to make eye contact nor did she thank me. Some other odd things she did: told me to tip more (15% wasn't enough) then complained about the service, how her legs got sweaty because it was too hot, smoked and blew towards me when she knew I am asthmatic, then ordered more complimentary bread at the end of the meal and ate it.

So I walked out of there thinking ok, we didn't click, she wasn't interested in me, I definately wasn't interested in her, as I found her behavior repugnant. No big deal, no big loss. (well actually HER loss) So a friend asked how it went and I said eh, not going to happen. Told him what happened and he said, "oh she pulled a power play on ya." I didn't think much of it at the time, but is that a new dating thing? Kinda like playing hard to get? But instead you act all domineering or self absorbed to get attention?

TL;DR: Took a girl out for dinner, she was rude, ignored me, didn't eat much, complained, and then left without even saying thanks. Friend told me she "pulled a power play" on me. What does that even mean?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Ah, yes, the power play. It's a classic move where someone tries to assert dominance or control in a relationship by being manipulative, passive-aggressive, or just plain rude. It's not a new dating thing, but it's definitely a common tactic used by some people to get what they want. In your case, it seems like she was trying to assert her dominance by being demanding, complaining, and ignoring you. The fact that she didn't even say thanks or make eye contact when you left is a clear sign of disrespect.
2. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I think your friend might have been trying to be funny, but "power play" is actually a term used in BDSM communities to describe a situation where one person takes control and dominates the other. In your case, it seems like she was just being a jerk, not trying to assert dominance in a sexual or romantic way.
3. **u/relationship_guru**: Power play or not, it's clear that this girl was not interested in you or the date. She was more concerned with getting what she wanted and ignoring your needs and boundaries. It's okay to walk away from someone who treats you poorly, and it sounds like you made the right decision. Just remember that you deserve better than someone who is going to disrespect you like that.
4. **u/throwaway1234567**: Yeah, I think you're right. It's not a power play in the classical sense, but more like a display of poor behavior. It's like she was trying to show you who's boss, but really, she just came across as entitled and rude. You did the right thing by walking away and not wasting your time on someone who doesn't respect you.
5. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I agree with the others. It's not a power play, and it's definitely not a dating tactic. It's just plain bad behavior. You deserve someone who is respectful, kind, and considerate of your feelings. Don't settle for someone who treats you poorly, and don't waste your time trying to figure out what they're trying to do. Just move on and find someone who is a better match for you.

TITLE: Seeking advice for non-traditional co-ed shower

POST: My fiancé and I don't like the notion that the wedding is all about the bride — he's getting married too! So, for instance, we will both be escorted down the aisle. 

My mom and some friends are hosting a wedding shower for us. I am adamant that it is not a *bridal* shower — it's for both of us. In keeping with our non-traditional-ness, **we would like to invite people who are important to us, no matter their genitalia**. 

My mom thinks we should invite all our friends' significant others, since it's a co-ed shower. But some of these people we haven't met or have only met a few times. They certainly wouldn't make the list of "people most important to us." 

Things get a little complicated if we don't invite the SOs, because my mom wants to put "co-ed shower" on the invitation (so she doesn't get inundated with calls like this: "Wait, did you mean to address this to Amy AND John?"), but **I don't want people with long-term SOs to feel shafted because the SO wasn't invited**. We don't exactly want it to be a "couples shower" — just a gathering of people close to us. 

Any advice? Maybe an alternate name we could give the event so people still understand it's a shower and that it's okay to come if you're a man? We don't want the guest list to get so big that it's basically another wedding. (Plus, space is an issue; it'll be held at my parents' house.)

TL;DR: We're having a non-traditional co-ed wedding shower and want to invite people important to us, regardless of gender. How do we handle the guest list and invitation wording to avoid offending anyone?

**Top comments:**

1. **"Why not just call it a 'Celebration of Love' or something similar? That way, you're conveying the inclusive vibe without making it a 'couples shower'."**
2. **"I think it's great that you're thinking about this! You could also consider having a'small group' or 'intimate gathering' instead of a traditional shower. That way, you can still have a meaningful celebration without feeling like you're excluding anyone."**
3. **"I would suggest having a 'housewarming' or 'welcome to the family' theme instead of a shower. That way, you're focusing on the idea of building a life together, rather than the specific details of the wedding."**
4. **"You could also consider having a 'potluck' or 'bring a dish to share' style event. That way, everyone can contribute and feel included, regardless of their relationship status."**
5. **"I think it's great that you're thinking about this! You could also consider having a 'game night' or'movie night' instead of a traditional shower. That way, you can still have a fun and relaxed celebration without feeling like you're excluding anyone."**

**Original poster's response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I think we're going to go with the 'Celebration of Love' idea. It's simple, yet conveys the message we want to get across. We'll also make sure to include a note on the invitation about the inclusive nature of the event, so people know what to expect. Thanks again for your help!"**

TITLE: How would I(m18) salvage friendship with girlfriend(17f) after breaking up with her after 1-1/2 year relationship?

POST: I've(18m) never had much luck with girls but I've been shaping up my life together and would like to be a little more adventurous when it comes to the relationship world. I broke up with her(17f) after a 1-1/2 year relationship and told her that this was why, ensuring her that it wasn't her. Obviously she was still upset, and now she's giving me a choice of either actually going my separate way and possibly losing her completely, or being with her. I don't want to be in a committed relationship right now, but I also love her still; neither of these options will work. I'm trying to make my own option, where we remain friends and possibly, after college, think about becoming more serious. Is this possible? And if so, how can I do it?

TL;DR: Broke up with 17-year-old girlfriend after 1-1/2 years, now she's giving me a choice between losing her or being in a relationship. Want to remain friends and possibly rekindle later, but unsure if this is possible and how to make it work.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 18 and she's 17. That's a huge age gap. You should focus on your own life and not try to salvage a relationship with someone who's still in high school."

* "I'm 19 and I went through a similar situation. I told my ex that I needed space and time to focus on myself. It was hard, but it was the best decision I ever made. You need to prioritize your own happiness and well-being."

TITLE: I'm [26/f] in US and my best friend [32/m] is not. We discovered we have deeper feelings...he went home, now wants to step back. how do you deal with it?

POST: Someone I consider to be a best friend and I actually "met" here through reddit. Some time later, we decided to meet despite a great distance between the areas we live in. After spending time together in person, we discovered deeper feelings we have for each other, and I think we were both a bit surprised. It was very intense and very real. 

Now, he is back and we're apart again. I thought it would be fine because we could still talk, skype, etc. Not the same, but I'd rather have someone like that in my life in some way than not at all. Well, he is asking if we can "cool off." I'm so confused! We had conversations before parting that we would continue talking, that things wouldn't change, etc. 

Do I just back off for awhile and wait? Do I cut all contact?

Part of me wants to say "forget it," because I was probably was being naive and stupid, but then our friendship alone means a lot.

I'm sorry this is vague and probably a rambled mess.

TL;DR: Best friend and I discovered deeper feelings, he went home, now wants to step back. How do I deal with this?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like he's trying to backpedal and reevaluate his feelings. It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed or unsure about their emotions, especially when they're not used to having romantic feelings for someone. I wouldn't cut off all contact just yet, but I would have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you value your friendship and that you're willing to take things slow, but you need some clarity on where he stands. It's possible that he just needs some space to figure things out."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "It's great that you're considering your feelings and the potential consequences of your actions. Before making any decisions, take some time to reflect on what you want from this situation. Do you want to maintain a friendship with him, or do you want to explore the possibility of a romantic relationship? Be honest with yourself and consider what would be best for your emotional well-being. If you decide that you want to pursue a romantic relationship, it's essential to communicate your feelings and boundaries clearly with him. Remember that you deserve respect and honesty in any relationship."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before, and it's always a mess. My advice is to take a step back and reevaluate your feelings. Are you really willing to settle for a friendship with this guy, or do you want to take a chance on something more? If you're not sure, then maybe it's best to give him some space and focus on yourself for a bit. Remember that you deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to make things work, not just someone who wants to 'cool off' and see what happens."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think it's great that you're considering your feelings and the potential consequences of your actions. Before making any decisions, take some time to reflect on what you want from this situation. Do you want to maintain a friendship with him, or do you want to explore the possibility of a romantic relationship? Be honest with yourself and consider what would be best for your emotional well-being. If you decide that you want to pursue a romantic relationship, it's essential to communicate your feelings and boundaries clearly with him. Remember that you deserve respect and honesty in any relationship." (Note: This comment is identical to the one from RelationshipAdviceBot, likely due to a bot posting the same response.)

**Key takeaways:**

1. Take time to reflect on your feelings and what you want from the situation.
2. Have an open and honest conversation with your best friend about how you're feeling.
3. Consider what would be best for your emotional well-being and prioritize your own needs.
4. Don't cut off all contact just yet, but be prepared to reevaluate the situation if your feelings aren't reciprocated.
5. Remember that you deserve respect and honesty in any relationship.

TITLE: CC transfer student need help with deciding on major.

POST: Hey everyone, 

This is my third year at community college and I'm going to be applying to colleges this year. 

Throughout the years at community college, I've been thinking about what kind of major I should be doing or career path after college. I've never had solid grasp on what I wanted to do, so I usually followed what my parents and friends guided me towards. 

In my first year at CC I thought about majoring in computer science, but after taking some programming classes I was shocked to find out it was completely different from what I thought computer science was. 

Then in my second year, I thought about doing electrical engineering because my dad told me it was a safe and stable major to choose, also because he works in a engineering company himself. I thought to myself this was going to be the major I'm gonna stick to, but after getting obliterated by physics classes I was discouraged and changed my mind about engineering major. 

Now here I am in my third year, still debating what major I should be considering. However, I was considering maybe majoring in mathematics because it is somewhat related to a career path I was interested in, which is cryptography.  

However, I've read about some stories about math majors who've went onto upper division classes and ended up changing their majors because it was not what they expected. I'm aware of what the upper division courses for maths are like because I've looked up some problems people post, and it does terrify me quite a bit. 

I guess I'm worried because if I do end up majoring in mathematics, I may end up switching my major when I transfer because I don't have enough guts to handle it. 

I'm sure a lot of people on here had similar problems or anxiety like me, having doubts about one's ability, how did you guys decide on your major and what advice can you guys give me? 

Sorry for my disorganized post, my thoughts are jumbled up so I can't put together my thoughts well together. I appreciate any feedback or comments.

TL;DR: CC transfer student struggling to decide on major, considering math but worried about upper division classes and potential switching majors.

TITLE: [Update 2] I [18 M] want to ask out a girl [18 F] out on a date, general tips needed.

POST: [Original](
(Clarification on this one, I didn't mean the one as the girl I wanted to marry)

TL;DR: I'm 18, and I really like this girl, 18 too. We've been friends for a while, and I think she's really cool. I want to ask her out on a date, but I'm really nervous. I was wondering if anyone could give me some general tips on how to do it smoothly.

---

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm 18, and I've been friends with this girl for a while now. We've hung out a few times, and I think she's really cool. I've been thinking about asking her out on a date, but I'm really nervous. I don't want to mess it up.

I was wondering if anyone could give me some general tips on how to ask her out. I want to make it smooth and not awkward. I don't want to scare her off or make her feel uncomfortable.

Some specific things I'm worried about are:

* What if she says no?
* What if she says yes, but it's not what she wants?
* How do I plan the date?
* What if it's a disaster?

I know it's normal to be nervous, but I want to make sure I do it right. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE 1:

Thanks for all the responses! I feel a bit better now. I think I'll just be honest with her and tell her how I feel. I'll make sure to be respectful of her feelings, regardless of what she says.

UPDATE 2:

I did it! I asked her out, and she said yes! We're going to a concert next weekend. I'm really excited. Thanks again for all the advice. It really helped me feel more confident.

TITLE: Me [20 M] really depressed, can't get ex off my mind, can't seem to want to move on.

POST: My ex dumped me about a month and a half ago. I have been with three women in the past three weeks but it really does not feel the same at all. I talked to my ex on the phone about a week ago, just telling her that her new boyfriend is a piece of shit and that he's brainwashing her into not talking to me, etc. It might sound crazy but the only reason I was with those other women was because I thought it would win back this ex that I was seeing a lot for 2 months.

Should I write my ex a love letter telling her how I feel? Should I call her once a day? Or should I just move on and try to find another girl like her? I do not want her to be the one that got away, and cannot seem to move on no matter how hard I try. She was basically my polar opposite, but I suppose that's why we were so attracted to each other.

Does true love just fade away? Why hasn't she even attempted to contact me this past month and a half when that's all I've been trying to do is to get a hold of her. Life seems so meaningless without her and I really don't know how to deal anymore. There are tons of suitable partners around me but I don't feel the same way about them to any degree.

I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. I love her, she loves me, but she can't seem to get over the fact that I asked if she was being unfaithful a couple of times. When the fight occurred I was 2 weeks behind on all of my school work and in the middle of a project, so I was stressed as hell in the first place, and then she being REALLY SARCASTIC which I struggle with regardless. These two things coupled together make me unbelievably furious, and I completely over-reacted. Not to mention how little sleep I was getting while I was with her. Should I be afraid to just show up to her house and give her the love letter I've been working on?

TL;DR: I'm 20, my ex dumped me a month and a half ago, I'm still really depressed and can't seem to move on. I've been with other women but it doesn't feel the same. I'm thinking of writing her a love letter or calling her once a day. I don't want her to be the one that got away and I'm really struggling to deal with my emotions. I love her, but she can't seem to get over the fact that I asked if she was being unfaithful a couple of times. Should I be afraid to show up at her house and give her the love letter I've been working on?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to take a step back and realize that your ex is not the same person you fell in love with. She's moved on and you need to do the same. Writing her a love letter or calling her once a day is not going to get you back together. It's just going to make you look desperate and pathetic."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but you need to focus on yourself right now. You're still grieving the loss of your relationship and that's okay. But you can't keep dwelling on the past. You need to start moving forward and finding ways to heal. That means taking care of yourself, getting out there and meeting new people, and finding new hobbies and interests. Don't be afraid to try new things and take risks. You never know what might bring you joy and fulfillment."
* "I think you should take a break from social media and the internet for a while. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that your ex is still out there and that you can get her back, but the reality is that she's moved on and you need to do the same. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own healing. You don't need to be constantly connected to the world to feel happy and fulfilled."
* "I think you should try to talk to your ex again, but this time, try to have a real conversation with her. Don't just focus on your own feelings and needs, but also try to listen to hers and understand where she's coming from. You might be surprised at what you learn and how it can help you both move forward."

TITLE: TIFU by sending my girlfriend a photo of a shirt

POST: So, this just happened two weeks ago, and I'm just now facing the shit-storm.

My girlfriend does wild land firefighting. Well, so needless to say we are in a short-term long distance relationship. 

Back story: her and I have been friends for two years. We got together in March (Pi Day!), and she spent her vacation with me during spring break. Well, she and I had lots of sex and clothes were thrown everywhere.

Last week I was cleaning my room and I found a shirt at the foot of my bed, but inside the corner of the bed frame. So, I sent my girlfriend picture of said shirt and said, "You left this here." Well, she went home yesterday, and started looking through her stuff, and she had both shirts she had brought.

She sent me a text that said, "We need to talk." This is also known as, "The four words that make your buttcheeks clench." She calls me and tells me she has both shirts and has no idea whose shirt I have. I told her, "Well, that makes two of us." I honestly don't know. 

I'm not fucking around on her. The last time I had sex was in December (more than likely this one's), and then there was that fooling around thing with that girl from work at the beginning of January, but no sex happened. I'm not fooling around on her, but I don't want her to feel like I am.

Her tone says she is going to let it go, but I'm not trying to give her a reason to doubt me.

TL;DR: I sent my girlfriend a picture of a shirt I found in my room, and now she's questioning my faithfulness.

---

This post is a great example of how a seemingly harmless action can lead to a major misunderstanding and a potentially damaging conversation. The OP (original poster) thought he was simply sending a harmless photo of a shirt, but it ended up causing his girlfriend to question his faithfulness.

The post highlights the importance of communication and trust in a relationship. The OP's girlfriend was understandably upset and felt the need to "talk" about the situation, which led to a tense conversation. The OP's honesty and willingness to listen to his girlfriend's concerns may help to resolve the issue, but it's clear that the situation has caused tension and uncertainty in their relationship.

The post also showcases the humor and relatability of the r/tifu subreddit, where users share their own stories of "Today I F**ked Up" and the community comes together to offer advice and support. The post's title, "TIFU by sending my girlfriend a photo of a shirt," is a great example of the lighthearted and humorous tone of the subreddit.

TITLE: Am I (21f) doing what is right for my daughter (3f) now that her father (23m) is dead or am I just ruining her life and my chances at potential relationships?

POST: My daughter is 3. Her dad (23m) is dead. Her dad and I(21f) were no longer together,(we were together two years but had been broken up for two years) however I am closer to his family than my own due to years of abuse and neglect with my family.

Multiple different men (26m&28m) are saying that if I want things to work out with him then I would need to cut my daughter's dad's family out of both of our lives because he and his family is going to take over their role.

 (Just to be clear I am not slutting around a lot, my daughter hasn't met any of these men... I just start talking to a guy, make it clear about her dad's family's role in her life and they basically tell me how they are going to take over that role and how her dad's family will start to not be involved. Then due to them saying how they don't want her dad's family in our lives I stop talking to them because I love her dad's family.)

Their basic reasoning is that her dad's family would undermine him and compare him to her deceased dad all the time. He doesn't know her dad's family and I know for a fact they never would. Also, the other part is that he believes he would become her only dad because he will be the one there for the majority of her life.. I feel as if they are wanting me to pretend her dad never existed and I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Am I being unrealistic thinking that all of this is wrong and that I need to avoid talking about my daughter's biological dad around her? Should I be acting like he never existed? I thought I was in the right to keep his spirit alive with my daughter because she really does act like her dad. And because I don't want her to forget him. But now I am worried that my view on this is skewed.

TL;DR: I'm a 21-year-old single mom whose 3-year-old daughter's father passed away. I'm close to his family due to my own family issues. Guys I talk to tell me I need to cut his family out of our lives to make things work with them. I don't want to erase her dad's memory and I'm worried about being unrealistic. Am I doing the right thing or am I just ruining my chances at relationships?

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're being realistic about not wanting to erase her dad's memory. It's okay to acknowledge his existence and the role he played in your daughter's life. You're not doing anything wrong by keeping his spirit alive with your daughter."
* "I understand why you're hesitant to cut his family out of your life, but it's also important to consider your daughter's well-being. If these guys are willing to take on a role in her life, it's not fair to her to have them constantly comparing her to her dad. You need to prioritize your daughter's feelings and well-being."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not 'ruining' your chances at relationships by being honest about your daughter's dad and his family. If someone can't accept that, then they're not the right person for you. You do what's best for your daughter and don't apologize for it."
* "I think you should focus on finding someone who is willing to accept and respect your daughter's relationship with her dad's family. If someone is trying to erase her dad's memory, that's a red flag. You deserve someone who will support you and your daughter's relationship with her dad's family."
* "I think you're being realistic about not wanting to erase her dad's memory. It's okay to acknowledge his existence and the role he played in your daughter's life. You're not doing anything wrong by keeping his spirit alive with your daughter." (This comment is repeated multiple times, showing that many users agree with this perspective.)

TITLE: My [15 M] and my friend [15 M] have been acting "gay" for each other as a joke between us, but he just came out and is actually gay.

POST: I have been friends with this person for a few months now, and we honestly get along very well. He's a funny guy, and we play a lot o' games together as bros. Whenever we're out together or at some sort of group gathering, we jokingly always act as though we are secretly deeply in love with each other and get all touchy. And up until now I thought he was straight, so I didn't really think much of it. (For reference, I am a bi-curious straight male.)

Anyway, today he finally came out to me and a select few as gay after realizing he felt this way roughly 2.5 years ago. I was really happy for him, because it was honestly a huge weight off his shoulders and it makes me happy knowing that he feels better about this. However, now I feel incredibly awkward. I'm not sure whether or not it's still okay to do the whole "gay couple" act with him at this point, because I don't want to play with his feelings like that knowing that it might not necessarily be an act on his part.

I am going to try talking to him when I get the chance and see what he says, but he's notorious for not giving very clear answers and I don't want to pressure him so soon after he has built up the courage to come out to me and a few others. But I don't know whether or not it's still okay to do this, and I'm not sure whether or not he might even have feelings for me, since he doesn't really do the "gay couple" thing with anyone else. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

TL;DR: My friend of 3 months just came out as gay, and we used to joke around about being in love with each other. I'm not sure if it's still okay to do this, and I don't know if he might have feelings for me.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, I think you're overthinking this. He came out as gay, but that doesn't mean he can't still be your friend. If he's okay with the 'gay couple' act, then go for it. If not, then respect his boundaries. Just be genuine and have an open conversation with him about how you're feeling."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "It's great that you're considering your friend's feelings! It's essential to respect his boundaries and decisions. If he's okay with the 'gay couple' act, then it's okay to continue doing it as a joke. However, if he's not comfortable with it, it's crucial to prioritize his feelings and respect his decision. Remember, your friendship is more important than any joke or act."
3. **u/anonymous_user**: "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your friendship. If you're genuinely happy for your friend, then you should be supporting him and respecting his identity. If you're still unsure about your feelings, maybe it's best to take some time to figure things out before continuing the friendship."
4. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you're being too sensitive. It's just a joke, and it's not like you're actually in a relationship with him. If he's okay with it, then it's okay. If not, then you can always find other ways to have fun together. Just remember to be respectful and considerate of his feelings."
5. **u/relationship_expert**: "It's great that you're taking the time to consider your friend's feelings and boundaries. Remember that your friendship is built on mutual respect and trust. If you're unsure about how to proceed, consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend about your feelings and concerns. This will help you both navigate this situation and strengthen your friendship in the long run."

TITLE: A question of character

POST: I (24f) have lived a very sheltered life,have been quite abused (in all categories), and struggle with many health issues. What I am beginning to see in not just my SO of 5 years but others is how different their characters are from mine. 

Friends, it does not really bother me much. I mean i sometimes trip out on what they say and their selection of words but I don't seem to judge them as much as my SO (obviously). 

I have been noticing that my SO, in various situations would do something that in my opinion would be morally wrong. The thing is, all of them are literally hypothetical. Like we would watch a movie or read about something and he would say, "oh if that was me I would have totally done blahblahblah". Usually the blahblahblah part is something that I find totally the wrong thing to do morally. 

I was raised in a very abusive household and yet i'd not hesitate to open doors for elderly, try to help out homeless, and I am not against the world at all. My SO is opposite but he is totally affectionate to me and it just seems like his words do not match his actions towards me and those who are close. 

Should I be worried about this? I understand everyone is different and I totally respect people for their choices but it just seems like my SO would be a villain in most hypothetical situations whereas, I would be a hero. 

Has anyone ever encountered something like this? Is it a red flag? I mean he has loved me through all my faults, disabilities and handicaps which I think takes someone special to do so. Also, he is not abusive or negative to me or anyone at all.

TL;DR: I'm noticing my SO's character is different from mine, and in hypothetical situations, he would do things I find morally wrong. Should I be worried about this? Has anyone else encountered something like this?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. Just because your SO has a different moral compass than you doesn't mean he's a bad person. Everyone has their own values and beliefs. It's okay to have differences. What's important is that he's not judging you for your differences and that he's treating you with kindness and respect.
2. **RelationshipGuru**: OP, I think you're focusing too much on hypothetical situations. What's more important is how he treats you and others in real life. Since you mentioned he's not abusive or negative, that's a good sign. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. It's possible he doesn't realize how his words might come across.
3. **ConcernedFriend**: OP, I think you should be worried about this. If your SO is consistently saying he would do things that are morally wrong, it could be a sign of a lack of empathy or a disregard for others. It's not just about hypothetical situations; it's about how he treats people in real life. Have you noticed any red flags in your relationship that you're not mentioning?
4. **RealisticRomantic**: OP, I think you're being too idealistic. Not everyone is going to share your values or morals. What's important is that your SO is a good person who treats you with kindness and respect. If you're happy in your relationship and he's not hurting you or others, then maybe it's not worth worrying about.
5. **ExperiencedAdvice**: OP, I think you should take a step back and evaluate your relationship. While it's true that everyone has their own values and beliefs, if your SO is consistently saying he would do things that are morally wrong, it could be a sign of a deeper issue. Have you noticed any other red flags in your relationship, such as a lack of empathy or a disregard for others? It might be worth having a conversation with him about your concerns.

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is concerned about her SO's character, as he often says he would do things that she finds morally wrong in hypothetical situations.
* Some commenters suggest that it's okay to have differences in values and beliefs, as long as the SO is treating the OP with kindness and respect.
* Others recommend having an open and honest conversation with the SO about the OP's concerns.
* Some commenters express concern that the SO's words may be a sign of a lack of empathy or disregard for others, and suggest that the OP evaluate her relationship and look for other red flags.

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [22F] says she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. What should I do?

POST: Just like it says on the tin. My SO of 2.5 years recently admitted to me that she didn't initially find me attractive, although she claims that changed after she got to know me.

I certainly understand that a person's overall attractiveness is a function of their personality, and one's level of attraction to a person can change over time, I'm very upset that she never felt any *physical* attraction for me. 

It's great that she's "attracted" by my personality and all, but I can't help but feel that this isn't good enough. I thought she was physically attractive right away. I feel pretty terrible about myself that she didn't feel the same way. I don't want to go on in a relationship where I feel that I'm not good enough for her.

I still love her very much, and I know she loves me. I'm pretty crushed at finding this out, and I don't know what to do about it. It seems to me that she was immature to think she could have a satisfying relationship with someone she didn't click with physically. I want her to be happy, so I can't help but wonder if we need to break it off so she can find someone who actually works for her physically.

Is this an overreaction? I think I'm emotionally compromised because I'm so upset about this. So I'm hoping for advice from a few smart people here.

What should I do? Is there a way of understanding what she's told me that doesn't make it sound so bad? What am I missing?

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 2.5 years just told me she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. I'm upset because I thought she was attractive right away. I feel like I'm not good enough for her. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I think you're overreacting. Physical attraction is just one aspect of a relationship. It's not the only thing that matters. If your girlfriend is happy with you and you're happy with her, then that's all that counts.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, it's not uncommon for people to develop feelings for someone over time. It's possible that your girlfriend didn't feel an initial physical attraction, but as she got to know you, she developed feelings for you. You should talk to her about how you're feeling and see if you can work through this together.
3. **u/skeptical_skeptic**: OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on physical attraction. There are many other things that can bring people together in a relationship. Have you considered what your girlfriend likes about you? What are your shared interests? What are your values? These are all important aspects of a relationship.
4. **u/heartbroken**: OP, I feel for you. It's tough to hear that someone you care about didn't initially find you attractive. But you need to remember that this is just one person's opinion. There are plenty of people out there who will find you attractive and love you for who you are. Don't give up on love just because of one person's opinion.
5. **u/relationshipcoach**: OP, I think you're making a big deal out of this. Physical attraction is just one aspect of a relationship. It's not the most important thing. You need to focus on building a strong connection with your girlfriend and working through any issues that come up. Don't let this one thing define your relationship.

---

**Discussion:**

The post sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many users sharing their own experiences and opinions on the matter. Some users agreed with the OP that physical attraction is an important aspect of a relationship, while others argued that it's not the only thing that matters.

Some users suggested that the OP talk to his girlfriend about how he's feeling and see if they can work through this together. Others recommended that he focus on building a strong connection with his girlfriend and not let this one thing define their relationship.

The discussion also touched on the idea that people's opinions and feelings about physical attraction can change over time, and that it's possible for someone to develop feelings for someone they didn't initially find attractive.

Overall, the discussion was a nuanced and thoughtful exploration of the complexities of relationships and physical attraction. Many users offered words of encouragement and support to the OP, and the post helped to spark a valuable conversation about the importance of communication and understanding in relationships.

TITLE: How did you escape disaster? I'll start.

POST: 8 years ago, as a sophmore, me and my buddies went to his car and smoked a bowl between classes, we show up to our next class about 5 minutes late, and the teacher being a bitch said we had to go to the office and sign in, so we do, and the office secretary obviously knew we were high so about 10 minutes after signing in, we're called into the office, I had a pipe and a 10 sack in my backpack so at this point I was shitting bricks, they placed me in this small ass 4x4 printer room with the yard duty. I knew I was screwed because the room was so small I had no chance to hide my stuff. I opened the small pocket of my backpack where everything was, and took out a pencil. I started twirling the pencil around in my hand and noticed that the yard duty was watching the pencil, so i keep doing that and then I flick it up in the air. As it falls to the ground, I reach for it, and with my other hand I grab my pipe and slide it under the printer. When my principal was done interrogating my friend I was called in. She had just escorted him to another room to sit until they figured out to do with us. I walk out the printer room, see she is across the room from her office, so I B-line into her office grab the weed and put it on the book case. Cop gets called in to search my things, and he's tripping because he keeps saying he could smell it. It was literally behind his head nose level. After searching my stuff 4 times he gives up. They lock me in the office and tell me to wait while the police officer talks to my principle. When I was alone for about 5 minutes, I took the weed off the bookcase and hid it in her desk drawer. I ended up getting suspended for being high and they tried to tell my mom I have a drug problem and wanted me to go to rehab. My mom pretty much laughed in her face and told her it's just marijuana. Never heard about it again, but the teacher did "resign" at the end of the year.

TL;DR: Got caught with weed at school, hid it in a printer room, then hid it again in the principal's desk drawer. Got suspended, but my mom didn't buy the "I have a drug problem" story.

TITLE: Moved into guy's Apt and Moving Out 1 month in. Who finds replacement?

POST: Hello,
I don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.

My question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- 
•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?
•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?
•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?
•	How can I protect myself in this situation?

I literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.

If I posted in to the incorrect subreddit, lemme know.

Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!

TL;DR: Moved into guy's Apt 1 month in, found it's not as great as thought, and found a cheaper place. Who finds replacement? How much notice? Should I tell roommate why I'm leaving? How can I protect myself?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're in a month-to-month lease, which means you can leave at any time without penalty. You don't owe your roommate any notice, but it's still considered polite to give them some time to find a new roommate. I'd say give them 2-3 weeks' notice. As for finding a replacement, it's usually the responsibility of the person leaving, but since you're not signed to a lease, you can just leave and not worry about it. Just make sure to clean the place before you go and leave it in decent condition."
2. **u/LegalEagle**: "As a legal matter, since you're not signed to a lease, you don't have any legal obligation to find a replacement. However, it's still considered polite to give your roommate some notice so they can find someone new. I'd say give them 1-2 weeks' notice. As for telling your roommate why you're leaving, it's up to you. If you want to be honest, you can tell them you found a cheaper place and it's a better fit for you. But if you don't want to be honest, you can just say you're moving for personal reasons."
3. **u/RoommateRants**: "I'm a bit surprised you didn't sign a lease, but I guess that's a whole other story. Anyway, since you're not signed to a lease, you don't have any legal obligation to find a replacement. But if you want to be a good roommate, you can try to find someone to take over your room. You can post an ad on Craigslist or use a roommate-finding service. Just make sure to screen potential roommates carefully and make sure they're a good fit for the place. As for notice, I'd say give your roommate 1-2 weeks' notice. And as for telling your roommate why you're leaving, just be honest and tell them you found a cheaper place. It's not a big deal."
4. **u/ChicagoNative**: "I'm a Chicago native, and I gotta say, $650 per month is a bit steep for a place in the city. But hey, you found a cheaper place, so that's good. As for finding a replacement, like the others said, it's usually the responsibility of the person leaving. But if you want to be a good roommate, you can try to find someone to take over your room. Just make sure to screen potential roommates carefully and make sure they're a good fit for the place. As for notice, I'd say give your roommate 1-2 weeks' notice. And as for telling your roommate why you're leaving, just be honest and tell them you found a cheaper place. It's not a big deal."

TITLE: I [m/18] got involved with a girl [f/19] in a relationship, but she doesn't know how to leave her bf.

POST: A couple of months ago a friend and I started developing feelings for each other. She had been in a relationship of 3 years and often told me how unhappy she was with the relationship and how poorly he treats her. Things between us started getting serious and their relationship started falling apart. 

Being college students on winter break, we began hanging out every day for the past month. I could tell she was finally accepting that she could leave him. We make each other very happy and often discussed our own relationship and the future. 

Just as I thought she was finally mustering up the strength to end it with him, his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Being together with him for 3 years, she is very close with his family and thinks leaving him would be too much for him to handle. She told me she doesn't want to lose me but can't risk hurting him right now. 

Obviously it's a difficult situation and I'm understanding, but I can't help being upset knowing that she isn't happy. I want to make her happy and I know I can but I'm not sure what to do at this point. And no, I don't want to hear that I shouldn't have gotten involved with her in the first place.

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a girl who's unhappy in her current relationship, but she's hesitant to leave her boyfriend due to his family situation. I want to make her happy, but I'm not sure what to do in this situation.

**Comments:**

* "I understand your frustration, but you have to consider the bigger picture. Her boyfriend's family is going through a tough time, and she's trying to be supportive. It's not just about her happiness, but also about being a good person and showing empathy."
* "I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Let her know that you understand the situation, but you also want to be with someone who is happy and fulfilled. Maybe she'll come around and realize that she's not happy in her current relationship."
* "It's not fair to expect her to leave him just because you're in a relationship with her. She has her own feelings and priorities, and you need to respect that. Maybe you should focus on building a strong connection with her and supporting her through this difficult time, rather than trying to change her mind about her current relationship."
* "I think you're being a bit selfish here. You're not considering the impact that your actions could have on her boyfriend and his family. You need to think about the bigger picture and what's best for everyone involved."
* "I'm in a similar situation, and I can tell you that it's not easy. But I would say that you need to focus on building a strong connection with her and supporting her through this difficult time. Maybe she'll come around and realize that she's not happy in her current relationship, but until then, you need to be patient and understanding."

TITLE: 19f with fiance 20m and roommate 19m- fiance and I recently got infected with scabies and have started treatment, roommate refuses

POST: Recently, my fiance  (20 m) and I (19f) moved into a new apartment with a mutual friend (20m) and somehow contracted scabies (don't know how). We've both been itchy af and have been to the doctor who confirmed that it was scabies for the both of us. Our room mate (20m) has not had symptoms of scabies bites appear yet but I have asked him to get treated as well and to treat his clothes and linen so that our apartment does not get reinfested after treatment.

My room mate refuses to buy the lotion needed to kill the mites on his skin (if there are any on him) and refuses to rewash and dry his linen and clothes. I'm scared that if he does not get treated the infestation of our apartment will not go away. I'm almost there to asking him to move out if he refuses treatment. He is not on the lease.

TL;DR: Fiance and I got scabies, roommate refuses to get treated and rewash/dry clothes and linen. I'm at a loss on what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "I would definitely have a serious talk with your roommate about the importance of getting treated and taking steps to prevent re-infestation. It's not just about you and your fiance, but also about the health and well-being of your roommate. If he's not willing to take the necessary steps, it might be best to consider finding a new roommate."
* "Have you considered talking to your roommate about the potential consequences of not getting treated? Like, if he gets infested and then goes to work or school, he could be spreading it to others. Maybe he's not thinking about the bigger picture."
* "I would also suggest talking to your landlord about the situation. If the roommate is refusing to take steps to prevent re-infestation, it could be a problem for the entire building. They might be able to help mediate the situation or even evict the roommate if necessary."
* "I would be having a serious conversation with your roommate about his refusal to get treated. If he's not willing to take care of himself and his belongings, he's not a good roommate. You and your fiance deserve better."
* "Have you considered getting a second opinion from a different doctor? Maybe they can offer some advice on how to handle the situation with your roommate."
* "I would also suggest setting some boundaries with your roommate. Like, if he's not willing to get treated, he can't use your shower or share food with you. You need to protect yourself and your fiance from the potential re-infestation."
* "I would be having a serious talk with your roommate about his refusal to get treated. If he's not willing to take care of himself and his belongings, he's not a good roommate. You and your fiance deserve better."

**Subreddit's Response:**

The subreddit community is very supportive and understanding of the situation. Many users offer advice on how to handle the situation with the roommate, from having a serious talk with him to considering finding a new roommate. Some users also suggest talking to the landlord about the situation and setting boundaries with the roommate to protect themselves and their fiance from the potential re-infestation. Overall, the community is very helpful and supportive in offering advice and guidance on how to handle the situation.

TITLE: My best friend's boyfriend is being controlling. Breaking me and my best friend apart. Any ideas?

POST: I'm 17, she's 17. Her boyfriend is 16. Me and her hang out constantly, we also share some classes together. I've also known her longer (1year). They share no classes, he's younger, and they've been dating for 1 month. 
The thing is, I write a FACEBOOK post about her and I jump-starting her car because we killed her battery;

And he gets off on a storm to her about how that's "disloyal" or something. 
He's messaging me now as we speak about the post and how he "doesn't want any problems, because it's our 1month anniversary". Fuck his problems. Any advice on what I should do? I understand that I should respect their relationship, AND I DO. But the fact that he got worked up over that is a red flag to me.

TL;DR: My best friend's boyfriend is being controlling and getting worked up over a harmless Facebook post. What should I do?

---

This post is a great example of how a seemingly harmless situation can escalate into a complex issue. The OP (original poster) is caught in the middle of their best friend's relationship, and they're struggling to navigate the situation. Here are some possible ways to approach this:

1. **Stay neutral**: As the OP mentioned, they should respect their best friend's relationship. However, they can also maintain a healthy distance from the situation. They can choose not to engage with the boyfriend's messages or comments, and focus on their own relationships and priorities.
2. **Talk to your best friend**: The OP should have an open and honest conversation with their best friend about their concerns. They can express their feelings and worries about the boyfriend's behavior, and ask their friend to address the issue. This can help the best friend realize the impact of her boyfriend's actions and potentially lead to a resolution.
3. **Set boundaries**: If the boyfriend continues to message the OP or try to control their interactions with their best friend, they can set clear boundaries. They can politely tell the boyfriend that they don't want to engage in conversations about their relationship or personal issues, and focus on their own relationships and priorities.
4. **Seek support**: The OP can talk to other trusted friends, family members, or a counselor about their concerns. They can also seek advice from online resources or support groups for people dealing with controlling relationships.
5. **Consider a mediated conversation**: If the situation is causing tension and stress, the OP and their best friend can consider having a mediated conversation with a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or family member. This can help them work through their issues and find a resolution.

Remember that every situation is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The OP should prioritize their own well-being and take steps to maintain a healthy and positive relationship with their best friend.

TITLE: Giving my[29m] gf/fiance [23f] an ultimatum - am I wrong?

POST: She has extremely controlling/manipulative parents, and she's from a foreign culture. In practice, this means that she can't actually do anything with me beyond spending a few hours together, though we've been a couple for the past couple years. "It's not right" for her to spend the night at my place, even though I reside pretty far away; "It's not right" for her to go on a trip with me to visit my family in Los Angeles, which is pretty far from the Midwest; "It's not right" for us to go on weekend trips, because that would look bad to the gossipy neighbors/community.

This is from her and her parents. I asked her to get married a while ago, and she agreed, though said she wouldn't tell her parents until after she got her Master's degree, which is a couple years from now, as she somehow owes it to them to finish not just a regular college career, but all of graduate school, before she gets married.

It's been a while, and I have her the ultimatum: either we get married next year, you give up this cultural stuff that keeps us apart and actually do some things with me, or we part ways.

She's upset, of course, and doesn't like that I've given her such an ultimatum. I feel guilty about it; should I? Am I doing the wrong thing? I love her, but I don't know how long I can go with this semi-relationship dominated by the wishes and desires of her parents (who, by the way, she resides with).

TL;DR: I gave my girlfriend an ultimatum: get married next year, or we part ways. She's upset, and I'm wondering if I did the wrong thing.

TITLE: TIFU by getting run over by an ice cream truck

POST: So, obligatory this did not happen today.

You should know I'm a guy with his pride. So when my SO started mocking my coordination for tripping over stuff, I got pretty mad and decided to prove to her that my coordination is perfect. Needless to say, just a few days later I was roaming the neighbourhood on my brand new unicycle while juggling some tennis balls (3, to be exact). 

That's where the fuckup begins. One sunny day I was riding around the area when suddenly this ice cream truck appears from behind the corner and heads for me. I could do nothing but watch the kid behind the steering wheel desperately try to stop the truck - luckily, at the last moment he realised he can simply turn the wheel, so he did not break every single one of my bones, just a few ribs and a hip dislocation. 

Turns out was also the time when a lot of illegal immigrants began to come over here - god bless you, Merkel - so some employers felt like it was a perfect opportunity and 'hired' many those people for some shitty money without any contract or training. What's even worse is that the kid driving was quite literally this - a kid. 

We finally agreed not to call the police after he promised me a free vanilla scoop every time he was around. My SO was super mad and my unicycle went straight to the garbage can, but damn me if it wasn't worth it.

TL;DR: I got run over by an ice cream truck while juggling tennis balls on a unicycle to prove my coordination to my SO. The kid driving the truck was an illegal immigrant and we agreed not to call the police in exchange for free ice cream.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that the kid was actually a very nice guy and we became good friends. He even gave me a job at his ice cream truck and I'm now the official 'unicycle juggling tennis ball guy' for the summer. My SO is still mad at me, but I'm getting free ice cream and a fun job out of it. Silver linings, right?

TITLE: TIFU By drunkenly making out in someones bathroom

POST: So this literally just happened last night and I am typing whilst recovering on my sofa. I go to pretty intense Uni, UWO, both for work and for partying and last night I went to a friends house warming party. People were chilling music was bumping etc. Essentially I consumed 1/2 a bottle of Jack Daniels and 1/2 a bottle of tequila and somehow managed to chat up a girl, will call her J. One thing lead to another and we headed to the bathroom. As we were furiously making out and taking of our clothes, I somehow managed to slip and fall straight into the tub with her, which would have been fine, if not for the fact my head slammed against the soap holder in the tub.

The thing smashes into pieces and my head starts bleeding. A lot. My entire chest is covered in my own blood in a very short span of time. I can't feel much because of the alcohol and now J is kidda freaking out (understandably). She gets toilet paper and gets we to put pressure on the wound whilst she calls an ambulance. When we are leaving, the whole party is freaking out because they think the cops will show up. I essentially spend all night at the hospital, getting stitches whilst J (bless her) keeps me company. I ended up with 18 stitches on the side of my head. But I did get to stay at Js after I got released from hospital!

TL;DR: I got drunk, made out with a girl in a bathroom, fell and hit my head on a soap holder, got 18 stitches, and ended up staying at her place. I'm still trying to process what happened.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that I'm really grateful for J's help and support throughout the whole ordeal. She's an amazing person and I'm lucky to have her in my life. And to anyone who's reading this, please be careful when drinking and make sure you're with people you trust. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to explain this to my parents...

TITLE: USPS mysteriously sent me someone else's package - readdressed it to me [US]

POST: Mysterious situation. Sorry about the text wall. Located in the United States.

A few months ago, I bid on (and won) an auction for tools and other supplies on a popular online auction website. The package was mysteriously delayed during shipping at one of USPS's sort facilities due to what I assumed was the rather extreme inclement weather.

Once I received the package, I found a letter from the postal service INSIDE the box stating that due to a mishap at the facility there were packages that became dislodged during shipping. If any problems arose to send a letter to their complaint department. The package did not contain the tools but rather an incredibly large number of sealed DVD sets to a very popular TV show. 

I contacted the seller and he had no idea what I was talking about with DVDs. He stated that he sent only the items pictured in the auction. I have no reason to believe that he was being disingenuous because when you compare the price of both items on Amazon, the overall value of the DVD sets is much, much higher.

After some back and forth with the USPS I was able to reach someone who started an official search at the three USPS sort facilities in the region. After three months they terminated the search and stated that my item was not found. I also inquired what to do with the DVDs that I received. Initially they said to keep them sealed because if my original package was found, they may need me to send the DVDs back to the sort facility. But later they essentially told me on the phone that they didn't know what to do with the DVDs.

Months have gone by, and I decided to try and recoup my money so I've started selling them locally. I've only sold a handful, but I began to wonder what kind of legal ramifications I could run into? Also I became paranoid that the DVDs may contain some kind of elicit or illegal material so I unwrapped several of them and skimmed through them on my computer. I could not find anything out of the ordinary. They appear to simply be the entire DVD set of the TV series.

TL;DR: USPS sent me someone else's package (DVD sets) instead of my original package (tools). I contacted the seller, and he had no idea what I was talking about. USPS terminated their search after three months, and I'm left with the DVDs. I'm selling them locally, but I'm worried about legal ramifications and potential illegal content.

QUESTION: What legal implications could I face for selling the DVDs? Are there any laws or regulations that I should be aware of? Should I be concerned about the potential for legal action from the original owner of the DVDs? Should I have done something differently? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

---

This post is seeking legal advice and is not intended to be taken as legal advice. It is recommended that you consult with a licensed attorney for specific guidance on your situation. However, I'll provide some general information and potential legal implications.

**Legal Implications:**

1. **Copyright Infringement:** You may be infringing on the copyright holder's rights by selling the DVDs without their permission. The Copyright Act of 1976 grants copyright holders exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. If you're selling the DVDs without permission, you could be liable for copyright infringement.
2. **Unlawful Possession:** If the DVDs contain explicit or illegal content, you may be in possession of illegal materials. Possessing or distributing such content can lead to criminal charges.
3. **Trespass to Chattels:** You may be liable for trespass to chattels if you're selling the DVDs without the owner's consent. This is a tort (civil wrong) that involves the unauthorized use or interference with someone else's property.
4. **Unfair Competition:** If you're selling the DVDs at a price lower than their original value, you may be engaging in unfair competition. This could lead to legal action from the copyright holder or the original owner.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Consult with a Lawyer:** It's essential to consult with a licensed attorney to discuss your specific situation and potential legal implications. They can help you understand your rights and obligations.
2. **Stop Selling the DVDs:** Until you've consulted with a lawyer and understand the legal implications, it's recommended that you stop selling the DVDs.
3. **Return the DVDs:** If you're concerned about the potential legal implications, you may want to consider returning the DVDs to the original owner or the copyright holder.
4. **Document Everything:** Keep a record of all correspondence, transactions, and events related to the DVDs. This can help you establish a paper trail in case of legal action.

Remember, this is not legal advice, and you should consult with a licensed attorney for specific guidance on your situation. The legal implications of selling the DVDs can be complex, and it's essential to take a cautious approach to avoid potential legal consequences.

TITLE: She [17F] likes me [17M] back but her best friend also likes me :\

POST: For the past few months, this girl (Girl 1) I go to high school with has been flirting with me and things have been going pretty well. Recently, she told her best friend (Girl 2) that she likes me and how she wants to be with me etc. 

Well, it turns out Girl 2 started liking me a little while before she found out that Girl 1 and I have been flirting for the past few months. Being the good friend that she is, Girl 2 decided to keep quiet about liking me because she didn't want to ruin/get in between me and Girl 1. 

However, recently Girl 2 finally cracked about how she liked me and told Girl 1 everything. Now Girl 1 is acting distant because she doesn't want to ruin her friendship with Girl 2. But the thing is, Girl 2 is encouraging Girl 1 to not give up on this relationship because Girl 2 knows that Girl 1 really likes me.
 
At this point, both me and Girl 1 are avoiding each other and I'm trying my best to kill these feelings I have for her because I don't want to ruin their friendship. The thing thats killing me is that we both like each other and everything would be perfect if it wasn't for this one detail :(

Even Girl 2 wants us to be together and she is mad at herself for liking me and telling Girl 1 about it in the first place. 
I'm stuck in the middle of all this and I don't know if i should back off or if I should still have hope in this entire situation.

TL;DR: Girl 1 likes me, but her best friend also likes me and told her about it. Now Girl 1 is acting distant because she doesn't want to ruin her friendship with Girl 2. I'm stuck in the middle and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you gotta talk to Girl 1 and be honest with her. Let her know how you feel and what's going on. It's not fair to keep her in the dark and make her feel like she's losing you because of her friend's feelings." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I think you should take a step back and let them work it out. It's not your problem to solve. If Girl 1 and Girl 2 can't figure out their friendship and feelings, that's on them. You can't control how others feel, just how you feel." (u/skeptical_squirrel)
* "Girl 2 is a good friend for keeping quiet about her feelings, but now she's causing drama. Maybe you should talk to her and tell her how you feel. If she's really a good friend, she'll understand and support your decision." (u/awkward_penguin)
* "This is a tough one. I think you should try to talk to Girl 1 and see how she feels. If she's still interested in you, maybe you can work something out with Girl 2. But if Girl 1 is really torn between you and her friendship, it might be best to back off and let them figure it out." (u/relationship_rookie)
* "You're 17, dude. This is a lot to handle. Maybe you should just focus on your own feelings and what you want. Don't worry too much about what others think." (u/teen_tales)

TITLE: I [24 M] broke up with my gf [22 F] of less than a month because of the trauma of being woken up by her seizures

POST: In the beginning of a wonderful relationship, I was woken up one morning by my (ex)girlfriend convulsing beside me. She had two "pre-seizures" and though I supported her completely I was mortified. It was a terrifying experience. I knew that she had had them some years back, but was not warned that this might happen.

The spark was gone - it permanently changed how I felt about her, despite my efforts to keep it alive.

The relationship had been awesome up until that point, and now I can't shake the feeling that either A: I'm an asshole and/or B: I screwed up what could have easily been the best relationship of my life to date.

TL;DR: Woke up to my girlfriend having seizures, couldn't shake the trauma, broke up with her.

---

This post is a great example of how the trauma of a significant event can impact a person's ability to continue a relationship. The OP (original poster) is struggling with the aftermath of the seizure and is questioning whether he made the right decision in breaking up with his girlfriend.

The post is also a good example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance. Many users in the comments are offering words of encouragement and understanding, while others are sharing their own experiences with trauma and how it has impacted their relationships.

Some common themes that emerge in the comments include:

* The importance of communication: Many users are emphasizing the need for open and honest communication about the seizure and its impact on the OP's feelings.
* The complexity of trauma: Users are acknowledging that trauma can be a complex and deeply personal experience, and that it's not always easy to overcome.
* The need for self-care: Several users are encouraging the OP to prioritize his own emotional well-being and to seek support if needed.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their experiences and receive guidance and support.

TITLE: I'm [21M] torn between where to go. Confused about 2 women, both [20F]. Been in a relationship with one for ~1.5 years.

POST: Hi all. So I've got quite a long story here, but I'll try and keep it as short as possible. 

So to begin, me and a woman I dated for 3 years broke up nearly 2 years ago. Contact was cut completely within 3 months, and I haven't spoken with her since. Around that time she began dating another guy. A while after this, I also began dating another woman. 

So me and this woman have dated for the past 1.5 years roughly, and things have definitely had more downs than ups. We have fought constantly, never seen eye to eye, and don't share any hobbies. 

My ex and I, on the other hand, completely got along, would have a few big fights here and there, and shared mostly the same hobbies. 

My current girlfriend and I have been on and off for the past few months, and right now we're in a hiatus. But, for the past few weeks, I've caught myself thinking about my ex more and more, and I'm not sure why. I hadn't thought about her in a long time, and lately I can't seem to get her out of my head. I legitimately miss her.

So through the grapevine, I've heard that my ex and her boyfriend aren't exactly doing the best, and things are falling apart. I want so badly to text her or something. But I just don't know if it's right. 

Can anybody give me advice here? I'm absolutely lost and confused right now. Thanks to anyone who can help!

TL;DR: I've been in a relationship with one woman for 1.5 years, but I've been thinking about my ex a lot lately. My ex is now with someone else, and I'm torn between reaching out to her or staying with my current girlfriend.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're still hung up on your ex. Take some time to reflect on why you're thinking about her so much. Is it because you genuinely miss her or because you're feeling stuck in your current relationship? Be honest with yourself."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It sounds like you're torn between two relationships that aren't exactly healthy. Take a step back and think about what you want in a relationship. Do you want to be with someone who makes you happy, or do you want to hold onto a past relationship that's no longer an option?"
3. **u/itsmeagain**: "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. You can't keep jumping from one relationship to another without taking the time to reflect on your own feelings and desires. Maybe take a break from dating for a bit and focus on yourself."
4. **u/justanotheruser**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're just not happy in your current relationship. If you're thinking about your ex more and more, it's probably because you're not fulfilled in your current relationship. Maybe it's time to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what's not working and see if you can work through your issues together."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "Also, don't forget that your ex is with someone else now. Even if you do reach out to her, it's not like you're going to get back together or anything. You're just going to be stuck in limbo, wondering what could've been. Don't do that to yourself, man."
6. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you should also consider the fact that your ex is with someone else now. It's not like she's just sitting around waiting for you to come back. She's moved on with her life, and you should do the same. Don't waste your time pining after someone who's no longer available."
7. **u/justanotheruser**: "I think you should take some time to think about what you want in a relationship. Do you want to be with someone who makes you happy, or do you want to hold onto a past relationship that's no longer an option? You can't keep living in the past, man. You need to move forward and focus on what's best for you."

TITLE: This is my mom's amazing giant kitty Bart. (He was named by the shelter.)

POST: My mom adopted him in late 2009. He was sent back from the shelter TWICE, despite the fact that the shelter strongly warned the adopting families that Bart was a mature, independent cat who didn't do well with children and needed to be the only pet. Apparently, when he was returned, it was because he was "mean." My mom adopted him, let him do his own thing in the house, didn't get in his space at all, a month after she adopted him he jumped into her lap.

Now, he follows her from room to room. He's friendly and loving to both me and her, and loves sitting in our laps- which can be a problem, because he's a HUGE cat who weighs like 18lbs! He's a giant panther cat stalking around, but he's a sweetheart, and even acknowledges and accepts strangers now (if they offer attention)!

Point being, if you're going to adopt, PLEASE make sure you listen to the shelter about the temperment of the cat. Cats are wonderful, loyal, loving creatures, but they are NOT submissive, they are NOT dogs, you CAN NOT "train" them (past a certain point), they will not BEND to you. You can support them and take care of them and they WILL love you undyingly, they will follow you around, purr in your lap and constantly try to attack your feet from under the bed. Just acknowledge that they are little people with personalities. :) Bart is a CHARACTER for sure. :)

TL;DR: My mom adopted a giant kitty named Bart who was sent back from the shelter twice due to his independent nature. Now he's a loving and loyal companion who follows her everywhere and loves sitting in her lap.

POST: I just wanted to share a picture of my cat, Luna, because her little nose is just the cutest thing. She's a 2-year-old domestic shorthair, and she's got this tiny little pink nose that's just so adorable. It's like a little button!

I love taking pictures of her because she's always posing for me, and her little nose is always the first thing I notice. It's just so cute! I've tried to get pictures of her other features, like her big green eyes and her fluffy fur, but her nose always steals the show.

I know it sounds silly, but I just can't get enough of her little nose. It's like it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen. I've even started calling her "Nosey" because of it!

TL;DR: My cat, Luna, has the most adorable little nose, and I just can't get enough of it. I love taking pictures of her and showing off her cute little face.

POST: I just wanted to share a picture of my cat, Mr. Whiskers, because he's a master of the art of napping. He's a 5-year-old domestic shorthair, and he's got this ability to fall asleep anywhere, anytime.

I've seen him fall asleep on top of a pile of laundry, on the kitchen counter, even on the floor in the middle of the room. He's got this little trick where he'll curl up into a ball and start purring, and then suddenly he'll just drop off to sleep.

I love watching him sleep because he's so adorable. He's got this little twitchy thing he does with his whiskers when he's dreaming, and it's just the cutest thing. I've even started calling him "Mr. Snoozle" because of it!

TL;DR: My cat, Mr. Whiskers, is a master of the art of napping. He can fall asleep anywhere, anytime, and he's just the cutest thing when he's sleeping. I love watching him snooze because he's so adorable.

TITLE: Help me plan our honeymoon, South America in summer?

POST: Hey /r/travel!

Me and the gf are getting married june 1st and are trying to plan the honeymoon. We have 8 weeks from end of june to middle of august to spend. Our plan is to spend 1-2 weeks home in Sweden and then go somewhere semi-adventurous for the remaining 6 weeks

Our initial plan was to go to South America, maybe start off in mexico and then finish off in peru or chile. From some reading from wikivoyage i got the feeling that most of SA has rain periods during summers.

My questions to you /r/travel are:

1. Will it rain a lot in central/northern america during july/august?
2. What would you recommend us seeing in these parts of the world? 
3. How far in advance do we need to book inca trail?

Our interests are mainly hiking/outdoors, adventures, sports and living some of the local cultures.

TL;DR: Planning our honeymoon in South America, starting in Mexico and ending in Peru/Chile. Will it rain a lot in July/August? What should we see? How far in advance do we need to book Inca Trail?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/AdventureSeeker**: Hey! Congrats on your upcoming wedding! As for your questions, July and August are actually the dry season in Mexico, so you'll have great weather for outdoor activities. For Central America, it's a bit more mixed, but you'll still have plenty of sunny days. Northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) will be in the midst of their dry season, so you'll have great weather there too. As for the Inca Trail, I'd recommend booking at least 2-3 months in advance, especially during peak season.
2. **u/SouthAmericaExpert**: I'd recommend skipping Mexico and starting in Colombia instead. The coffee region is amazing, and you can hike to the Lost City. From there, head to Ecuador for the Galapagos Islands and then Peru for the Inca Trail. Chile is a bit farther south, so you might want to save that for another trip. Make sure to book your Inca Trail permits well in advance, as they can sell out quickly.
3. **u/TravelBug**: I'd suggest considering Argentina and Uruguay instead of Chile. The weather is usually great in July and August, and you can hike in Patagonia, visit Iguazu Falls, and enjoy the wine country. You can also take a boat tour of the Perito Moreno Glacier. As for the Inca Trail, I'd recommend booking at least 4-6 months in advance to ensure availability.
4. **u/LocalInsider**: If you're interested in local cultures, I'd recommend visiting the indigenous communities in Ecuador or Colombia. You can also take a cooking class in Peru or Argentina to learn about local cuisine. Make sure to research any necessary visas or vaccinations before your trip.
5. **u/AdventureAddict**: Don't forget to consider the altitude when hiking in Peru or Ecuador. Make sure to acclimate properly and stay hydrated. You can also consider taking a guided tour to help you navigate the trails and ensure your safety.

**TL;DR:** The dry season in Mexico, Central America, and Northern South America will be perfect for your outdoor adventures. Book the Inca Trail at least 2-3 months in advance. Consider skipping Mexico and starting in Colombia instead. Argentina and Uruguay are great alternatives to Chile. Research local cultures and necessary visas/vaccinations before your trip. Don't forget to acclimate properly when hiking at high altitudes. Happy travels!

TITLE: How to be the peacemaker during mine [26/m] and gf's [26/f] terrible fights.

POST: I've been dating my gf for 11 months now and for a while I've been commuting 3.5 hours on 4 day weekends to stay at her place while I was in grad school.  Now that we spend all days together, we seem to bicker a lot.  In addition to the bickering, we'll have long 2+ hour arguments (at least once a week.  Sometimes 2 days in a row) that always, ALWAYS end with me thinking "this is fucking crazy" and just apologizing and eating my words and feelings to settle down the argument.  

In 11 months, I don't think once she's started the compromise/apology/or anything to end the argument.  She thinks I'm generally selfish and that I "paint her out to be a bitch."  And sometimes she'll straight up lecture me like I'm a child.  

It's really hard to always have to be the first one to say sorry.  And then take the blame for the whole argument.  

Sometimes she even throws stuff when she's really mad.  I'm also beginning to think she doesn't respect me at all.  

The worst part is - I'm TERRIFIED of being alone.  Before I met her, I had no real friends, no life, I spent way too much time on the computer.  With her, I can be engaged soon, be living with her in an apt, have a dog (her awesome dog), and cool friends (her really nice friends).  Without her, I'd live at my parents for a while, have very rare hangouts with very few friends, be lonely as hell.  She's a great package deal.  And the thing is, I really don't think I could do better than her at all.  She's beautiful, smart, and when we do get along, it's like a fairy tale.  We have a real strong connection and compatibility when we're getting along which is about 85% of the time.

TL;DR: I'm 26, been dating my 26 year old girlfriend for 11 months. We have terrible fights, and I'm always the one apologizing and taking the blame. She never compromises or apologizes. She thinks I'm selfish and paints me out to be a bad guy. I'm terrified of being alone and feel like I'm stuck in this toxic relationship.

---

This post is a classic example of a person seeking relationship advice, specifically on how to navigate a toxic dynamic in their relationship.

The use of specific examples and details helps to illustrate the dynamic between the OP and their girlfriend, making it easier for readers to understand the situation and offer helpful advice.

Some potential responses to this post might include:

* Encouraging the OP to set boundaries and communicate their needs and feelings more clearly to their girlfriend.
* Suggesting that the OP seek counseling or therapy to work through their feelings of insecurity and fear of being alone.
* Advising the OP to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship, considering whether it is truly healthy and fulfilling for them.
* Offering words of encouragement and support, acknowledging the OP's feelings and validating their experiences.

TITLE: Our friend [22M] is an an abusive relationship with [21F]. What can we do?

POST: I am friends with a soft spoken guy - we'll call him Chad - in our social group (all friends from college) who is in an emotionally abusive relationship. His girlfriend Christina pushes him around, dictates his schedule, speaks on his behalf, and has no qualms with tearing him down in front of everyone. A few incidents have occurred over the past few months that have really made the fact that Christina is emotionally manipulative and abusive hit home. The only problem? Chad either doesn't see it, or he's too afraid to leave for fear that we will choose her over him.

My boyfriend and I want to help Chad, but we worry that Christina is keeping him from interacting with us. Our invitations to him to hang out have gone unanswered and he often seems nervous to speak with us when in a group setting. We've decided that the best course of action is to get him alone, to talk to him, and to tell him that *we are here*, we see what's going on, and we want to help. He won't be alone if he leaves Christina; he will still have us (at the very least) there as a support system.

Of course, if this goes badly (if Chad doesn't leave and Christina finds out what's happened), it will cause **massive** chaos in our friend group. We will probably be unceremoniously punted from our social circle. 

What should we do? My boyfriend and I have discussed this at length, and we genuinely feel that someone needs to reach out to him and let him know that he is not alone. Emotional abuse can be absolutely soul searing, and we want to offer him a life jacket if he needs one. At the same time, we realize that this may be the beginning of the end of our group of friends. How can we approach this delicately?

TL;DR: Friend in an emotionally abusive relationship, we want to help but worried about the potential fallout if Christina finds out. How can we approach this situation without causing more harm?

---

This post is an example of a complex and sensitive issue that can arise in a social group. The original poster (OP) is concerned about their friend Chad's well-being and wants to help him leave his abusive girlfriend Christina. However, they are also worried about the potential consequences of intervening, including being ostracized from their social group.

The post highlights the challenges of addressing emotional abuse, which can be a difficult and delicate issue to navigate. The OP is seeking advice on how to approach the situation without causing more harm or driving a wedge between themselves and their friend.

The comments on this post are varied and thought-provoking, with some users offering support and encouragement for the OP's efforts to help Chad, while others caution against intervening and suggest that the OP should prioritize their own well-being and safety. Some users also share their own experiences with emotional abuse and offer words of wisdom and support.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities and challenges that can arise in social relationships, and the importance of approaching sensitive issues with empathy, understanding, and caution.

I've been applying to jobs I want for 2 years now, with 0 luck...I spend hours on my cover letter (even researching organization mission statements), I tailor my resume, I research the recruiter's name (but not always)...but everything feels like a dead-end. I think its because my current job is at the bottom of the totem pole and isn't related to what I want to do. I have 2 degrees and I've started a hobby website related to my career interests, but so far, still no luck.

TL;DR: I'm stuck in a dead-end job, can't seem to get hired for anything I want, and feel like I'm wasting my time.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Have you considered taking a course or getting certified in your desired field? Sometimes having a specific skillset can make you more attractive to potential employers. Also, have you tried networking? Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with people in your desired field. It's not just about having the right qualifications, but also about building connections and making yourself known."
2. **u/Redditor99**: "I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I realized that I was focusing too much on the job itself and not enough on the company culture. I started researching companies that aligned with my values and interests, and I reached out to people who worked there. I ended up getting an interview and eventually landed a job that I love. Don't give up! Keep applying, and don't be afraid to take risks and try new things."
3. **u/JobSearchWarrior**: "I've been in your shoes before, and I know how frustrating it can be. But here's the thing: it's not just about the job itself, it's about the industry and the company. Sometimes, it takes a little creativity and outside-the-box thinking to get noticed. Have you considered freelancing or taking on a side project? This can help you build your portfolio and get your foot in the door. Also, don't be afraid to reach out to people in your desired field and ask for advice or guidance. People are often willing to help, especially if you're passionate and dedicated."
4. **u/Unstuck**: "I think you're focusing too much on the job itself and not enough on your own personal growth. What are you doing to improve yourself and your skills? Are you reading books, taking online courses, or attending workshops? Sometimes, it's not about the job, but about becoming a better version of yourself. Focus on building your skills and confidence, and the right job will come along. Also, don't be afraid to take a break and recharge. Sometimes, we just need to step back and refocus."
5. **u/JobHuntress**: "I've been in your shoes before, and I know how tough it can be. But here's the thing: it's not just about the job itself, it's about the people you meet and the connections you make. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of luck and being in the right place at the right time. But don't give up! Keep applying, and don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. And most importantly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to take a few setbacks, and it's okay to not have it all figured out just yet."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post offer a range of advice and perspectives on how to become unstuck and move forward. Some commenters suggest taking a course or getting certified in a desired field, while others recommend networking and building connections.

TITLE: Past and present drug users/abusers/ and dealers, what are your craziest drug-related stories?

POST: An ex-friend of mine (let's call him rob) got hurt real bad a while back and was prescribed perc's for the pain. He wasn't into the idea of getting hooked on them so he barely took the pills. One day someone asked him for a free pill, and that's where the downfall began. Eventually and slowly Rob started to distribute the pills and began selling them. After seeing how fast the money came (over 20 grand in one month) he pretty much was the biggest perc connection in the area. 

At this point he was buying them illegally rather than getting them prescribed, so when his suppliers weren't able to meet the, he got about 20 grand together and flew to florida to get his pills. After finding a "reliable dealer" and testing some of the perc's, he was happy and bought them, then flew back. 

First deal back in my state, was a major one. Rob went to meet up with the buyer, and when they went to exchange the product, the pills... Were fake. All of them. In a single blow all his business was gone. 

Now this is where Robs luck truly runs out. Being a semi-small town where this was all happening, the cops caught wind after a few months. Rob had quit the dealing due to the fake pills, but barely a few days later, while Rob was at a fellow drug-dealers house waiting for pizza, things got suspicious. Their regular pizza guy wasn't the one deliviring, but it was a guy in his mid-40's. For some reason Rob opened the door, and immediatelywas bum rushed by 10 cops. 

Both Rob and his friend were placed under arrest. The cops found the 10000 fake percs, and looked like they hit the jackpot, thinking they were real. Fast-forward after court, percs were found as fake and all Rob got was a year in jail for possessing fake drugs.

TL;DR: Friend gets prescribed perc's, starts selling them, gets into trouble with fake pills, and gets arrested.

TITLE: Sketchy job offer

POST: Long time lurker, first post ever. I'm looking for a bit of help trying to figure out if this potential job is legitimate. Regardless of my desperation, I'm typically rational when it comes to making big life decisions but last week, I received an email from a recruiter about a potential "Project Management" position from a VC from Delaware and all I had to do was apply on their website if I was interested. I was already sketched out but 2 things checked out: 1. Recruiter had a corporate email and 2. The website seemed really legit, so I thought that it wouldn't hurt to apply. There was no financial information requested, only my address and phone number as well as my references.

On Monday, I received another email, asking to schedule a phone interview. At this point, a lot of emotions take over and I request for a call at their soonest availability. The next day, I receive the call right on schedule by a female with a heavy Russian-ish accent. I was asked a couple basic questions like my typical workday and my career goals. It was very brief, 8-10 minutes but I immediately felt that I was being scammed. After the phone call I do even more research and found that the site has been active for only 21 days.

Today, I got an email about the next step from a Sr. in Human Resources. Attached was a contract for a one-month paid training which is apparently a part of their "screening process" before they decide to hire full time. Again no financial info was asked from me, just e-sign the document.

The document says that the corporate address is in Kowloon and I haven't been able to find ANY contacts on linkedin but they included a bunch of address for the new office in Los Angeles. I'm going to call all the numbers to see if I could speak with anyone. How should I go about all of this to find out if this is a real job and also a what is the best way to protect myself if it isn't?

TL;DR: Got a job offer from a VC in Delaware, applied, had a phone interview, and now they're asking me to sign a contract for a one-month paid training. The website is only 21 days old and I can't find any contacts on LinkedIn. Should I be concerned and how can I protect myself?

---

**Comments:**

* "This is definitely a scam. Don't sign anything or give them any more information. Report the website and the recruiter to the relevant authorities."
* "I would recommend being cautious, but not necessarily dismissing it as a scam. It's possible that it's a new company that's not well-established yet. Try to get more information about the company and the role before making a decision."
* "I would be very skeptical of a company that asks you to sign a contract before even offering you the job. Legitimate companies typically don't ask for that kind of commitment before the job is even confirmed."
* "I would recommend doing some more research on the company and the role before making a decision. You can also try to contact the company directly to ask more questions and get a better sense of what they're looking for."
* "I would be very cautious of a company that is asking for your personal information, such as your address and phone number, before even offering you the job. Legitimate companies typically don't ask for that kind of information until after the job is confirmed."



**Conclusion:**

The post is about a potential job offer from a VC in Delaware, which seems suspicious due to the lack of information about the company and the role. The OP is concerned about the legitimacy of the job and is seeking advice on how to protect themselves. The comments are divided, with some people advising the OP to be cautious but not dismissing it as a scam, while others are more skeptical and recommend reporting the website and recruiter to the authorities. The OP is advised to do more research on the company and the role, and to be cautious of companies that ask for personal information before offering the job.

TITLE: [Freshman Advice] Partying/Early Social Questions

POST: Hey everybody!

I'm going to preface this with the fact that I'm a great student, I'm on top of my studies, and I'm currently in the process of applying to clubs and getting involved with organizations around campus, that said:

My first two weeks of college has been, well, much more uneventful than I expected. I have been looking for opportunities to go party on the weekends (nothing too stupid I promise) but I can't seem to find anything. It feels like frats run the party scene at my school (UF), and the only way to have any fun on a Friday/Saturday night or tailgate is to be a part of one. Basically

TL;DR: Freshman looking for party opportunities on campus, but feeling like frats run the show and it's hard to find non-frat events.

---

REPLY 1:

Hey fellow Gator! I totally feel you. I was in the same boat last year, but I found a few ways to get involved and have some fun without being part of a frat.

First, check out the Student Activities and Involvement Center (SAIC) on campus. They have a ton of events and activities throughout the semester, from concerts to game nights to volunteer opportunities. You can also check out their social media pages to stay up-to-date on upcoming events.

Second, look into joining a student organization that aligns with your interests. There are tons of clubs and orgs on campus that focus on everything from music to community service to gaming. You can find a list of all the orgs on the SAIC website.

Finally, don't be afraid to reach out to upperclassmen or older students in your major and ask them about their experiences. They might have some great advice or know of some fun events that aren't necessarily frat-related.

Hope this helps, and good luck with your party search!

REPLY 2:

Hey! I'm a junior at UF and I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in your shoes before, and it can be tough to find non-frat events.

One thing that might help is to look into the different cultural organizations on campus. There are tons of groups that focus on specific cultures, like Latinx, Asian American, or African American. They often have their own events and parties that are super fun and inclusive.

Another option is to check out the music scene on campus. There are tons of student-run music organizations that put on shows and concerts throughout the semester. You can also look into the different music genres and find a group that aligns with your tastes.

Lastly, don't be afraid to put yourself out there and make some new friends! Join a club or org that you're interested in, and attend some of their events. You never know who you might meet and what kind of fun you might have.

Good luck, and I hope you find some awesome events to attend!

Hey! I'm a senior at UF and I've been in your shoes before. I know it can be tough to find non-frat events, but I've found that the best way to do it is to just get out there and start attending events.

TITLE: What is an appropriate and healthy way that I [31 M] can officially break up with my ex GF [30F] of 2 years.

POST: GF on and off for 2 years and I have had major issues with her flirting through texts and various forms of social media... Every time I confronted her about it she only hid it better or took it to a different social media platform.... Have broken up many times and got back together with the intent on her working on it... This last time I decided this is it, however we said we would take a month 'break' of no contact to see if we really wanted this, then meet up and talk about our plans.....

I don't want to meet up but she keeps insisting we do, seeing her would make my heart decide for me and I know I will end up with her again, or at the very least, sleep with her again... I know thats not healthy. I love this woman, deeply, if not for the lack of trust and her decision to continue the flirty behavior, I would more than likely marry her. I want her to really work on herself and grow and be happy with her life after this break. I want to break up formally with her but I'm not sure how to do so in a healthy way. She says she needs closure but I don't know what to say. I'm not going to see her face to face, I dont even want to talk on the phone. But I want to break up in a healthy contructive way where we both leave this better than when we came in.... 

Help?

TL;DR: 2 year on-again, off-again relationship with GF who has major trust issues. Want to break up formally but don't know how to do so in a healthy way. Want to avoid meeting up or talking on the phone.

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're doing the right thing by not wanting to meet up or talk on the phone. It's understandable that you don't want to be tempted to get back together. Instead, you could write her a heartfelt letter explaining your feelings and reasons for breaking up. This way, she'll have closure and can process her emotions without you being present. Make sure to be honest and clear about your feelings, but also be kind and respectful. Remember, you're doing this for your own well-being and growth, not to hurt her."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the letter idea. You could also consider sending her a text message or email explaining your decision. Keep it simple and straightforward, but also be sure to acknowledge her feelings and let her know that you appreciate the good times you had together. Remember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and don't feel obligated to have a long, drawn-out conversation. You've done what's best for you, and that's something to be proud of."
3. **u/sadbuttrue**: "I think you're being really brave by recognizing that you need to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. It's not easy to admit when something isn't working, especially when it's someone you love. Remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationships, and it's okay to take the time you need to focus on yourself. Don't worry too much about what she'll think or how she'll react - focus on your own growth and healing. You got this!"

**Key takeaways:**

* Write a heartfelt letter or send a respectful text/email to break up with your ex in a healthy and constructive way.
* Prioritize your own emotional well-being and don't feel obligated to have a long, drawn-out conversation.
* Acknowledge your ex's feelings and let them know that you appreciate the good times you had together.
* Remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationships, and it's okay to take the time you need to focus on yourself.

TITLE: I [M17] have dated this girl [F17] twice in this year and she dumped me twice, we are still friends, I realize I still liked her a lot, should I just ask her out again? Help

POST: We're both currently enrolled in high school. Me and her dated for several weeks during the end of the last year's school year. After summer break, school started and we had classes together and we both became friends again, eventually we got back together, but then she dumped me again only after a short period of time (less than a month) cause of something I did which was not serious at all. Semester one passed, we are still friends to this day. And I feel like I still really adore her and such. I'm just wondering whether I should just tell her that I like her again or should just forget her and start new relationship.

TL;DR: Dated girl twice, got dumped twice, still friends, still have feelings for her, should I ask her out again?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you gotta take a step back and think about why you keep getting dumped. Is it because you're not good enough for her or is it because you're not the right fit? Maybe it's time to focus on yourself and find someone who appreciates you for who you are.
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: Hi there! It sounds like you're still reeling from the breakups and haven't fully processed your emotions. Before you ask her out again, take some time to reflect on what you learned from the previous relationships. What did you do wrong? What can you improve on? Also, consider whether you're ready to take on the potential risks and challenges that come with dating someone who's already rejected you twice.
3. **SarcasticSally**: Girl, bye. You're 17 and you've already been dumped twice? Maybe you're just not ready for a relationship. Take some time to focus on yourself, your friends, and your own personal growth. Don't be afraid to take a break from dating and focus on becoming the best version of yourself.
4. **ConcernedCousin**: I think you should take some time to think about why you're still holding onto these feelings. Are you doing it because you genuinely care for her or because you're afraid of being alone? Maybe you should try to focus on building a stronger connection with someone else and see if that helps you move on.
5. **RationalRuth**: I think you should ask yourself if you're willing to take the risk of getting rejected again. If the answer is no, then maybe it's best to move on and focus on other relationships. But if you're willing to take the risk, then go for it! Just make sure you're prepared for any outcome and don't get your hopes up too high.

---

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are a mix of advice, concern, and skepticism. Some people think the OP should take a step back and focus on themselves, while others think they should take a chance and ask her out again. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that they need to do some reflection and self-examination before making a move.

TITLE: This girl I'm seeing [26F] wants to stop seeing me bc of my financial situation. I'm [24M]

POST: So I've been seeing this girl for almost a month and we really like each other, but ever since I've been hanging out with her my credit card dept has increased by 1500 dollars....on top of that I also owe 10000 in dept to student loans + car payments. I want to get rid of this dept asap, this way I'll be able to build my capital. 

So when I told her that I want to cut down on my spending she said that it was a huge turn off for her and that what I said is a dealbreaker. 

So should I just let the two of us break up, while I'm still not fully emotionally attached to her, or should I find a compromise with her? Or should I allow us to break up without resistance because she couldn't understand that I need to work on my finances (knowing that this issue would cause problems in the long run)?

TL;DR: Girl I'm seeing wants to break up with me because of my financial situation. I'm trying to figure out if I should let her go or find a compromise.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not willing to work with you on this issue, and that's a red flag. If she's already saying it's a dealbreaker, it's likely she's not interested in being in a relationship with someone who's struggling financially. You deserve someone who's willing to support you through tough times, not someone who's going to judge you for it."
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I think you're being a bit too focused on your credit card debt. Have you considered talking to her about your financial goals and how you plan to achieve them? Maybe she's not understanding the bigger picture. You could also offer to work together to find ways to reduce your expenses and increase your income. It's possible she's not aware of the sacrifices you're making to pay off your debt."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to 'fix' your financial situation before you can be in a relationship. It's okay to have debt, and it's okay to be working on paying it off. What's important is that you're taking steps to improve your situation and that you're being honest with your partner about it. You don't need to 'fix' everything before you can be in a relationship. Just be open and honest with her about your financial situation and see if she's willing to work with you."
4. **u/realisticexpectations**: "I think you're being a bit too optimistic about your financial situation. You owe 10,000 in student loans and 1500 on your credit card. That's a lot of debt. It's not just about 'cutting down on spending' - it's about making a plan to pay off that debt. You need to be realistic about your financial situation and stop pretending like it's not a big deal. If your partner can't understand that, then maybe she's not the right person for you."

**Conclusion:**

The post highlights the challenges of navigating financial issues in a relationship. The OP is torn between letting the relationship go or finding a compromise with his partner. The top comments offer a range of perspectives, from advising the OP to prioritize his financial goals to suggesting that he should be more open and honest with his partner about his financial situation. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the OP's priorities and what he is willing to compromise on in his relationship.

TITLE: Dropped out of college as of a weeks ago, what can I do?

POST: *week

I was looking to major in Computer Science Engineering but couldn't even get through my statistics and Physics course.    I now have 33 credits and a C- average.  My college was one that was wellknown for it's engineering program.  I've made one SQL database in my entire life, and have only had novice experience in Java.  I am lost and don't know what I want to (and still can) pursue at this point.

I am feeling dejected and down.  The college was all I ever wanted, it gave me grant that paid for the tuition completely and most of room and board.  I am regretting and blaming myself for being unmotivated and didn't seek help until it was too late.  I know and it's all my fault.
I also cannot pay for college out of my own pocket.

Reddit, what can I do?

TL;DR: Dropped out of college due to lack of motivation and struggling with courses.  Feeling lost and regretful.  What can I do now?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to realize that college isn't for you. You can always go back to school later if you want to. In the meantime, you can try to gain some work experience in the field you're interested in. You can also try to learn new skills online, like coding, and build some projects to showcase your skills. Remember, it's not the end of the world, and you can always pivot and try something new."
2. **u/CodeNewbie**: "I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I was struggling in my computer science courses and felt like I was the only one who didn't get it. But then I realized that I didn't have to be a CS major to work in tech. I started taking online courses and building projects, and now I'm working as a software engineer. You can do the same thing. There are tons of free resources online, like Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and Coursera. You can also try to find internships or entry-level jobs in the field you're interested in. Don't give up!"
3. **u/Engineer42**: "I'm an engineer and I can tell you that it's not just about the grades. It's about the passion and the drive to learn. If you're not enjoying it, then it's not worth it. You can always go back to school later if you want to, but for now, try to focus on building your skills and gaining experience. You can also try to find a job in a related field, like IT or data analysis. Remember, it's okay to take a break and re-evaluate your goals. You're not alone in this."
4. **u/Anonymous123456**: "I'm a college dropout too. I dropped out of my business program because I realized that I didn't want to be in business. It was a tough decision, but it was the right one for me. You can always go back to school later if you want to, but for now, try to focus on building your skills and gaining experience. You can also try to find a job in a related field, like marketing or finance. Remember, it's okay to take a break and re-evaluate your goals. You're not alone in this."

TITLE: TIFU by not paying attention to my Facebook messages

POST: I am currently deployed to Afghanistan, and the military life has been pretty hard on my marriage. I've been having a lot of my mind and you could almost say borderline depressed. There is a lot of stuff that I can't just tell my wife, especially over a social network site, but I don't lie to her. I tell her I have a lot on my mind and I will tell her all about it when I get home. I didn't think it meant anything beyond that. My job here is a desk job, and I get a phone call from my supervisor about the 15th rumor of when we are actually going home. So, I message my wife, "oh my jesus, I just don't care anymore!" What I then noticed is that she sent something just before that that went along the lines of, "I think I know what's been on your mind. I know we haven't had the best marriage due to your deployments but we've been through too much just to give up." Of course right after I see that, I attempted to correct myself. I typed 2 words and then, out of nowhere, power outage. Our internet went down for numerous hours and I think my wife thinks I really don't care about our marriage anymore. When it finally came back up, I got to send the message I meant to send and apologized. She hasn't messaged me back yet...

TL;DR: I'm deployed in Afghanistan and my marriage is struggling due to my deployments. I sent a message to my wife saying "I just don't care anymore" without realizing she had sent a message saying she knew what was on my mind and that she thought we should give up on our marriage. I didn't mean to send that message, but due to a power outage, it was sent before I could correct it. Now my wife thinks I don't care about our marriage anymore and hasn't messaged me back yet.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) is deployed in Afghanistan and is struggling with his marriage due to the stress and distance of being away from his wife. He tries to send a message to his wife saying that he's overwhelmed and needs to talk to her when he gets home, but due to a power outage, the message is sent before he can correct it.

The OP's mistake is that he doesn't pay attention to his Facebook messages and doesn't realize that his wife has sent a message that is relevant to the conversation he's trying to have. He also doesn't consider the impact that his message might have on his wife, especially given the sensitive topic of their marriage.

The post is relatable because it shows how easily mistakes can happen, especially when we're under stress or distracted. It also highlights the importance of communication and attention to detail in relationships. The OP's mistake has the potential to cause harm to his marriage, and it's a good reminder to be more mindful and considerate in our online interactions.

TITLE: I [24M] told my roommate to move out by May, my girlfriend [29F] wanted by the end of February, and is now calling the relationship over.

POST: Long story. Ultimately, my girlfriend who I have been with for about 7 months now, has never liked my roommate and thinks he is the devil, full of darkness. I will grant her this, his drinking habits do bring in some darkness and have caused problems. I see this need for roommate shift, and me wanting to live alone (and eventually with her) as our lifestyle choices no longer matching up. To her, I choose my roommates wellness over hers. I gave a date I felt comfortable with since it is my grad school graduation month, which I decided going in I would want to live alone afterwards, but to her, I am a pussy and surrendered. I see it as me having a heart for a long time friend.

TL;DR: I told my roommate to move out by May, my girlfriend wanted him out by the end of February, and now she's calling the relationship over because I didn't prioritize her wishes over my roommate's well-being.

TITLE: Me [19 M] may have some serious feelings for my hairdresser [21-23 F] I want to spend new years together and I need some serious advise!

POST: So currently I am 19 years old. I think she between 21-23, not married, and has been cutting my hair for a few months. She always gives me dollars off my next hair cut and hums ever so sweetly. She talks to me about making up our own stories and intrigues me ever so. I can't get her out of my head and as I was walking out I heard her say "no". As I left I got a burst of inspiration and wrote my name with my phone number. Rapping it in a dollar I told the other person to make sure she gets this. There is a small chance I may have wrote the wrong number down. Regardless, I want to call up the hair cutting place and ask if she is there. If she is, I can buy some hair jell and ask her out. Would this be wise? I need advise!
Still no call the next day...I really want to spend new years eve with her. Should I put forth more effort to contact her? I really hope that I can build a relationship and explore my sexual fantasies with this individual. She is all I can think about. Reddit, I really need advice to handle this situation. I am so lost.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my hairdresser, want to spend new years with her, but she said "no" and I'm unsure what to do. Should I call the salon and ask if she's there? Should I put forth more effort to contact her?

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Dude, you're 19 and she's 21-23. That's a big age gap. You're still in high school, she's probably in college or working. You need to focus on your own life and priorities before getting into a relationship with someone who's basically an adult. Take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings.
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: I understand your feelings, but you need to respect her boundaries. She said "no" for a reason. Don't push the issue and don't stalk her. If you really want to spend New Year's Eve with her, try to have a casual conversation with her next time you get your hair cut. Ask her if she's free and if she'd like to grab coffee or something. Don't be pushy or aggressive.
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: Bro, you're 19 and you're already thinking about your "sexual fantasies" with someone who's basically an adult? You're not even out of high school yet! Focus on your own life, your education, and your future before getting into a relationship with someone who's older and more experienced. You're not ready for this.
4. **u/optimistic_pessimist**: I think you're being a bit too eager. Take a step back and think about why you're so invested in this person. Is it because you really like her, or is it because you're bored and looking for excitement? Make sure you're not just chasing a thrill. If you really do like her, then try to have a casual conversation with her and see where it goes. But don't be disappointed if she says no again.
5. **u/relationship_coach**: I think you're putting too much pressure on this situation. You're 19, she's 21-23, and you're basically asking her to go out with you on New Year's Eve. That's a lot to ask. Take a step back, relax, and focus on building a connection with her. Don't try to force anything. If it's meant to be, it'll happen naturally. And if not, then that's okay too. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you. Just be patient and don't get discouraged. Good luck!

TITLE: an old flame [27M] and I [21F] are considering a FWB situation, but I'm a little uneasy.

POST: brief background: met James earlier this year through OkCupid. we went on a phenomenal date, had great sex, and were both pretty into each other. James is bipolar and lives two hours away, and a few days after our great date, he told me that he didn't think he was stable enough for a relationship with that much distance (he's an artist so money is sporadic). I was pretty bummed, deleted him off of Facebook, and moved on.

fast forward to last week. I started dating someone after James and that relationship ended last week. by coincidence, a few days later James reached out to me to ask how I was and to say he'd been thinking about me. we decide we should hang out in the next few days and meet in the middle at a hotel (to spare the distance and because I needed to get out of my house). we get drunk, have sex, cuddle, have a great time, even spend the next day together going to a few shops.

now James and I are talking about striking up a FWB arrangement, but I guess I'm a little concerned. the emotions weren't there when we hung out last week but I think that has a lot to do with my relationship recently ending and I have a feeling that if we have sex regularly knowing that we already had strong feelings for each other at one point, it's going to turn into a relationship. I guess I just don't know if you can have one without the other in this situation.

any advice? anyone been in this situation and can share their experience? I wouldn't be opposed to a relationship with James way down the line and I think he knows that, but obviously with the distance and his instability, it's a little hard to gauge.

TL;DR: had a great date with an old flame, we had sex, and now we're considering a FWB arrangement. I'm a little uneasy because I think our strong feelings for each other might resurface and turn into a relationship. Has anyone been in this situation and can offer some advice?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I've been in a similar situation before. I think it's great that you're considering the potential consequences of getting involved with James again. It's true that strong feelings can resurface, but it's also possible that you can maintain a healthy FWB arrangement without it turning into a relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with James about your concerns and see how he feels about it. It's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not getting into something that's going to cause you more harm than good.
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: I think you're being very responsible by considering the potential risks of getting involved with James again. It's great that you're thinking about your own emotional well-being and the potential consequences of your actions. I would suggest setting some boundaries and having an open and honest conversation with James about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. It's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not getting into something that's going to cause you more harm than good.
3. **u/old_flame**: I'm the OP. I think I'm going to take the advice of u/throwaway123456 and u/relationship_advisor and have an open and honest conversation with James about my concerns. I also think I'm going to set some boundaries and make sure we're both on the same page before we move forward. Thanks for the advice, everyone!
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I'm a little skeptical about this whole situation. I think you're getting caught up in the idea of having a FWB arrangement with James because you're still hung up on him. I would suggest taking some time to focus on yourself and your own emotional well-being before getting involved with someone else. It's also important to remember that you deserve better than someone who is unstable and unreliable.
5. **u/realistic_rachel**: I think you're being very realistic about the situation. It's true that strong feelings can resurface, but it's also possible that you can maintain a healthy FWB arrangement without it turning into a relationship. I would suggest setting some boundaries and having an open and honest conversation with James about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. It's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not getting into something that's going to cause you more harm than good.

**Conclusion:** The OP is considering a FWB arrangement with an old flame, but is uneasy about the potential consequences of getting involved with someone who has strong feelings for them. The comments offer advice and support, with some people suggesting that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with James about their concerns, while others are more skeptical about the situation. Ultimately, the OP decides to take the advice of the commenters and have a conversation with James about their feelings and boundaries. The situation is complex, and the OP is trying to navigate it in a way that is best for their own emotional well-being.

TITLE: My [30 F] colleague [28 F] is cherry-picking my responsibilities at work - what do I do?

POST: I've been working at my current company in the marketing department for 5 months, colleague in question has been there for one year. The company is a start up and only two years old. 

Recently, my colleague was given a lateral promotion of sorts: She's going from running our digital marketing to managing brand communications, as the former role wasn't really working out.  The head of our department (who hired me but didn't get along with her) resigned a few months ago. My colleague is temporarily being managed by the CEO, who told her to write her own job description.

Since this shift in her role a month ago, she's been suggesting to me and others that she now has some management authority over me and the work I do. It started with unwanted suggestions on how I should do my job and her cutting me off in meetings (she talks LOADS) but now is escalating to her trying to take elements that were originally in my job description for herself (i.e. blogger outreach) and delegating tasks to me. She's positioning herself as middle management but as far as I know no one has officially given her this authority.

It's clear to me that she has no direction in what she's supposed to be doing and is therefore trying to make herself look busy/important, but I'm finding it increasingly challenging to deal with her. Some of my colleagues have noticed this behaviour from her too and one said she's toxic to the business, so I'm trying not to take it personally.  However, the management team love her so I'm hesitant to say anything to my temporary manager. I realised today, though, that I am now miserable in a job I used to enjoy. What should I do? Should I try to talk to her or just bite the bullet and go to my manager?

TL;DR: Colleague is cherry-picking my responsibilities, positioning herself as middle management without official authority. I'm miserable and unsure what to do.

* "It sounds like your colleague is trying to assert dominance and control. You might want to try setting some boundaries and being clear about what you're responsible for." (This comment suggests that the OP should take a more assertive approach and clearly communicate their responsibilities to their colleague.)
* "I would try to talk to your colleague and explain how her behavior is affecting you. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact she's having and will be willing to change her behavior once she understands." (This comment encourages the OP to try to have a conversation with their colleague and work out a solution together.)

Overall, the comments in this post provide a range of perspectives and suggestions for how to address the situation, and the OP is able to get a sense of what might work best for them. The post also highlights the importance of communication and setting boundaries in resolving conflicts and improving relationships.

TITLE: [17/m] Lost [16/f] contact info!

POST: Okay so i am asking, and i'm going to try to request advise in the most non-creepy way i can think of. Here goes nothing. So basically i am 17 and i went on a vacation with my family. While in branson i met the most amazing girl in my life. She looked stunning and we had everything in common i.e. we talked the entire day without really doing much else. I could tell we were an instant click so by the end o the day she gave me her phone number and she told me where she lived which, coincidentally, is about half an hour away from me. When we said our goodbye it felt like the da best eva especially considering i didn't know what would happen. The next day my phone crashes and by the time i get it fixed my parents changed the carrier company so my sim card got wiped. I started freaking out because i don't remember her last name or her phone number. The thing i have to go on is her first name her neighborhood what high school and what she looks like. Does anyone know how to i can find her? I already tried social networking but to no avail.

TL;DR: I met an amazing girl on vacation, we clicked, and she gave me her phone number. But my phone crashed and I lost all my contacts, including her number. I don't remember her last name, but I have her first name, neighborhood, high school, and a description of what she looks like. How can I find her?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* **Don't stalk her**: Many users advised the OP to respect the girl's privacy and not try to find her through social media or other means. They warned that stalking is illegal and can lead to serious consequences.
* **Try to remember more details**: Some users suggested that the OP try to remember more details about the girl, such as her interests, hobbies, or any specific conversations they had. This could help him narrow down his search and increase the chances of finding her.
* **Post on local online forums or social media groups**: A few users suggested that the OP post on local online forums or social media groups, such as Facebook groups or Reddit forums, to see if anyone recognizes the girl or knows how to get in touch with her.
* **Be patient and don't get discouraged**: Many users encouraged the OP to be patient and not get discouraged if he doesn't find the girl right away. They reminded him that it's okay to take his time and that finding someone special can take time and effort.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS:**

* **Consider reaching out to mutual friends or acquaintances**: If the OP remembers any mutual friends or acquaintances who were also on the vacation, he could try reaching out to them to see if they know how to get in touch with the girl.
* **Be honest and respectful in any attempts to contact her**: If the OP does manage to find the girl, he should be honest and respectful in his approach. He should introduce himself, explain how he found her, and be clear about his intentions.
* **Remember that it's okay if it doesn't work out**: Even if the OP does find the girl, there's no guarantee that they'll hit it off or that a relationship will develop. He should be prepared for the possibility that it might not work out and focus on building a connection with her if they do meet again.

TITLE: Agreed to meetup Saturday but haven't heard from since

POST: Hello reddit..
I need some advice. I've been talking with this girl for about 2 weeks now. We went out last weekend and it went great. We were working on setting up another date and she told me that she was concerned about distance (its about a 30 minute drive). I messaged her back and said that i agree with her but there are ways around it. Anyways, after that she messaged me that sue would like to try and said that maybe we could set something up for Saturday (tomorrow) i replied that that sounded great and i was looking forward to it. I havent heard anything since (this was tuesday night). Ive texted her a couple of times just wishing her a good day at work (no more than once a day). I'm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to text her again but its now been about 5 texts since her last response. Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: Set up meetup for Saturday, haven't heard from her since Tuesday night. What do I do?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I'd say give her some space. It's been 5 days since your last conversation and she's been busy with work. Maybe she's just overwhelmed or dealing with something personal. Don't be too clingy, but also don't give up. If you really want to see her, you could try sending a casual 'hey, hope you're doing well' text and see if she responds."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's possible she's just busy or dealing with something. But also, it's possible she's lost interest. If you really want to see her, you could try sending a text asking if everything is okay. Something like 'Hey, just wanted to check in and make sure everything is okay. You seemed really excited about Saturday and I'm looking forward to it.' If she doesn't respond, it might be a sign that she's not interested."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm going to be a little harsh here, but if you haven't heard from her in 5 days, it's probably a sign that she's not interested. I know it's hard to accept, but sometimes people just lose interest or change their minds. Don't get your hopes up and just move on. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."
4. **OptimisticOllie**: "I think you should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just really busy or something came up. Try sending her a text asking if everything is okay and see if she responds. If she doesn't, then maybe she's not interested. But don't give up hope just yet!"

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for all the advice guys! I think I'll try giving her some space and see if she reaches out. If not, I'll just have to accept that maybe she's not interested. Thanks for the reality check, SkepticalSally. I'll keep you all posted on what happens."

TITLE: Me [21 M] hanging out with a bunch of girls too much a bad thing?

POST: I came home after being away the last couple of years. During my time away I developed a lot of confidence particularly around girls. I have been getting a decent amount of attention from girls who I feel are expressing interest, and I have dated some of them, whilst being friendly and texting others. 

I'm currently single and I wouldn't mind having a girlfriend but I'm just kind of going with the flow right now. Basically, I see a lot of potentials but I'm not really worried about making any moves, however I can sense signals. I'm just worried about making friends with too many girls and fear that I may be leading some on while I'm just happy being friends. I find myself hanging out with a lot of girls, I just enjoy their company more than guys. Is it bad to have too many friends that are girls? 

I am not trying to brag. I'm just a little concerned as to where this may be heading. Does reddit have any ideas/thoughts/ways to handle this?

TL;DR: 21M, been away for a couple of years, gained confidence around girls, currently single, hanging out with a lot of girls, worried about leading some on and making friends with too many girls.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not bad to have a lot of female friends. It's great that you've developed a sense of confidence around them. Just make sure to communicate openly and honestly with them about your intentions. If you're just looking for friends, say so. If you're interested in something more, say that too. Don't lead anyone on, but also don't shut down opportunities. You can always clarify what you're looking for in a conversation."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "I think it's great that you're enjoying the company of girls! Just remember that some girls might have different intentions than others. Be respectful and considerate of their feelings, and don't be afraid to set boundaries if needed. Also, don't be too hard on yourself if you do accidentally lead someone on - just apologize and move forward."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I think it's awesome that you're being honest about your concerns! It's always better to be upfront and clear about your intentions. Just remember that some girls might be looking for something more serious, while others might just be looking for a friend. Be respectful of their boundaries and don't pressure anyone into something they're not comfortable with. And hey, who knows, you might find someone special along the way!"
4. **GirlPower**: "I think it's amazing that you're embracing your confidence and enjoying the company of girls! Just remember to be respectful and considerate of their feelings, and don't be afraid to set boundaries if needed. And hey, who knows, you might find someone special along the way!"

**Key takeaways:**

* It's not inherently bad to have a lot of female friends, but it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your intentions.
* Be respectful and considerate of the feelings of the girls you're hanging out with, and don't be afraid to set boundaries if needed.
* Don't lead anyone on, but also don't shut down opportunities - be clear about what you're looking for in a conversation.
* It's okay to have different intentions with different girls, and it's important to respect their boundaries and feelings.

TITLE: Me [24/M] and my closest friend [20/F] of 1 1/2 years - she doesn't want a relationship (with anyone, just not me) but has feelings for me.

POST: Her and i got into a fight a few months ago and we both told each other we have feelings for each other, so naturally I asked her out. She told me she doesn't want one even though she has strong feelings for me. Whenever her and I get really close to each other she pulls away and we fight. this is a continuous cycle. I finally asked her why she does it and she told me it's because she doesn't want to get hurt again. she wants to be friends but is too scared to date again.

   I do like her but just being friends is also torturing me. I want to prove to her that some people can be trusted. She said she doesn't want to lose me but I just don't know what to do. I told her i needed to be alone for a while to think of my next move. I don't want to lose her either but just being friends isn't enough.

   Maybe I'm being childish but its killing me inside that she won't even though she flat at told me she does. Should i give her some space? Maybe I need to move on. I just don't know.

TL;DR: Me and my closest friend have feelings for each other but she doesn't want a relationship. We get close, fight, and repeat. I want to prove to her that some people can be trusted but she's too scared to date again. I'm torn between giving her space and moving on.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you're being a bit too invested in this situation. You've already had an honest conversation with her about your feelings, and she's made it clear she doesn't want a relationship. It's not about proving to her that you're trustworthy, it's about respecting her boundaries. Give her space and focus on yourself. You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it."
2. **u/sadpanda123**: "I feel for you, OP. It's tough to see someone you care about not feeling the same way. But you're right, just being friends isn't enough for you. Maybe it's time to take a step back and focus on yourself. You deserve to be in a relationship where both parties are on the same page. Don't give up on love, but also don't waste your time on someone who doesn't want the same things as you."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're misunderstanding what 'not wanting a relationship' means. It doesn't mean she doesn't have feelings for you, it means she's not ready or willing to commit to a romantic relationship. You need to respect her boundaries and focus on building a healthy friendship. If she's willing to work on her issues and become more open to relationships in the future, then maybe there's a chance for something more. But for now, just be there for her as a friend and see where things go."
4. **u/itsjustme123**: "OP, I think you're being a bit too clingy. You've already had a conversation about your feelings, and she's made it clear she doesn't want a relationship. It's not about proving to her that you're trustworthy, it's about respecting her decision. Give her space and focus on yourself. You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it."
5. **u/heartbroken123**: "OP, I feel your pain. It's tough to see someone you care about not feeling the same way. But you're right, just being friends isn't enough for you. Maybe it's time to take a step back and focus on yourself. You deserve to be in a relationship where both parties are on the same page. Don't give up on love, but also don't waste your time on someone who doesn't want the same things as you."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit's overall sentiment is that OP should respect his friend's boundaries and focus on building a healthy friendship. Many commenters agree that just being friends isn't enough for OP, and that he should focus on himself and move on if his friend is not willing to reciprocate his feelings. Some commenters also suggest that OP should give his friend space and not pressure her into a relationship if she's not ready. Overall, the subreddit's advice is to prioritize self-care and respect boundaries.

TITLE: foreman won't talk to me

POST: Hey so I started this job two years ago. I am thinking of going elsewhere. I just wanted to confirm with you guys that I'm making a good choice.

When I started there, there was a co worker who started 4 months before who would berate me and yell at me and my foreman would go around telling everyone that this co worker was the best and best worker they have ever seen.
I went and told my boss about the verbal abuse and harassment after a month this co worker quit.

For the next 8 months this foreman than would glare at me and tell me to work harder and tell me I wasn't a good worker, among other things.
I did tell him to treat me fairly and that hey this isn't right.

So things settled for a while. Now for the last three months. He doesn't even talk to me at all anymore. He will talk through our work lead to talk to me.
I have tried talking to him but all i get is one word answers

I take it he's either just hates me or is intimidated to talk to me cause I stand up for myself.

I have been looking for a new job and might have a new one in two months. But it does eat me up a bit that it has gotten to this point and oh yeah he is nice to everyone (just wish he would grow up and talk to me about the problems he's having in his head with me)

TL;DR: Foreman won't talk to me after I stood up for myself and reported verbal abuse. I'm looking for a new job and it's eating me up that it's gotten this far.

TITLE: Long distance BF of 3 years (18M) doesn't seem that excited to see me (18F)

POST: My long-distance boyfriend is home for the weekend but he doesn't seem that excited to see me. I met him on his way back from the coach station yesterday evening, after I'd been at college and work. I just wanted to hug him and kiss him straight away, but he kind of just ignored that / didn't reciprocate. Example: I pulled him towards me and kissed him when we were walking up my street, just because I haven't kissed him for 3 weeks and I wanted to. It wasn't forced or anything, but then he kept saying we should stop because we're in the middle of the street (it was 10:30pm, no one else around) and we should'save it for later' (I'm at college/work 'later').He also said the same thing, and that I was getting 'carried away', when we were kissing after he walked me home. Isn't that a good thing?

He is pretty shy and does tend to internalise a lot, but we're very close and open with each other. 

We've only been apart 3 weeks this time but found it more difficult than other times. It was all 'I miss you' texts, but now he's home... I don't know. 

I don't know if I've just got unrealistic expectations of what his reaction'should' be. I kind of want him to jump on me and hug me and kiss me. I guess I just didn't feel that wanted. BUT I don't know if I'm just over romanticising / idealising the situation. 

Note: we've been together 3 years and have been long distance for 4 months.

TL;DR: Long distance boyfriend of 3 years doesn't seem that excited to see me after 3 weeks apart. I feel like he's not reciprocating my affection and it's making me feel unwanted. Am I just over romanticising or is this normal?

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like he's just being shy and not knowing how to express his emotions. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."
* "I think it's normal to feel a little underwhelmed when you're apart for a long time and then suddenly see each other again. It's like your body and mind are adjusting to being together again. Maybe try to relax and not put too much pressure on the situation."
* "It's possible that he's just not feeling the same level of excitement as you are right now. Maybe try to focus on the things you're grateful for in your relationship and see if that helps shift your perspective."
* "I think it's great that you're communicating your feelings with him! It's important to be open and honest in any relationship. Maybe try to find some common ground and see if you can work through this together."
* "It's possible that he's just going through a tough time and isn't feeling his usual self. Maybe try to be patient and understanding, and see if things improve over time."
* "I think it's normal to feel a little disappointed or underwhelmed when you're apart for a long time and then suddenly see each other again. Maybe try to focus on the things you're looking forward to doing together and see if that helps shift your perspective."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post suggest that the OP's feelings are normal and that it's possible that her boyfriend is just being shy or going through a tough time. The comments encourage the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about how she's feeling and to focus on the positive aspects of their relationship. The post also highlights the importance of communication and understanding in any relationship.

TITLE: Me [29:M] recently broke up with my gf [28:F] and now I don't know if I'm regretting it or just missing her...

POST: Here's the post about our breakup a few weeks ago - 

Now I find myself thinking about her more and more each day. I know there were parts that weren't great, because I can read that post. However, we've had a little bit of contact here and there, but nothing about the breakup. Just chit chat things about finding a place to live and stuff. We're still friends on Facebook and Twitter and she *seems* like she's doing all right, but maybe she's just doing that to make me feel less guilty...? I don't know.

I guess I'm just not sure what it is I'm feeling. I thought I'd be able to just move on and be fine because I was never really emotionally invested. Am I just bothered because she *seems* all right or do I really care more than I think I do? I want to send her an email (yes, an email of all things) and tell her what I'm going through and that maybe I'd like to hang out some time soon. I'm just afraid of building her hope (and mine?) up and then letting us both down if that feeling isn't there again...I'm not sure what i want to do here and I just don't know exactly what it is I'm going through. 

Should I send her an email? Should I try and get together with her and see if something is there? Should I even try? Or should I just delete her from social media and invoke a strict NC? Any advice would be decent.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, still thinking about her and unsure if I'm regretting it or just missing her. Want to know if I should send her an email, hang out, or just move on.

TITLE: TIFU by fishing down my top for money to pay for cigarettes.

POST: My mother and I recently passed an enjoyable week in Spain. On our last evening there, she remembered that my father had asked her to buy him some tobacco, as it's cheaper there than at home. So we wandered along the city streets of Madrid until we found a tobacco shop. I waited outside, then after a while she beckoned me in. She was twenty euros short, and remembered that she had given me 50 euros for emergencies. Which I had placed in my passport-carrier around my waist, under my clothes. While in airports getting out my passport simply involved lifting up my top slightly to remove my passport, on this evening I had chosen to wear a dress. Given that reaching under my dress to the purse would involve flashing my underwear to a shop of Spaniards, I decided that the most decent option was to plunge my hand down the top my dress, rummage for a while finding the zip on the passport holder, extracting the note and closing the zip, then to slowly remove my hand holding the 50 euro note without accidentally pulling up the dress. This attracted a fair few stares, and I was thankful to leave shortly afterwards.

TL;DR: I had to fish down my top to get 50 euros from my passport holder to pay for my dad's cigarettes, and it attracted some awkward stares in a Spanish tobacco shop.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my GF [20F] for 4 years, she wants to explore the outside world but I still love her so much

POST: My girlfriend who has been with me for 4 years since we were 16 started showing signs of lost interest, her texts are short and short and simple despite me sending long texts and she sometimes find me clingy and annoying although I didn't do anything different from the past 4 years. I txted her my feelings and she said we should give each other some time and space, and that she doesnt want to commit to anything for her life because we're only 20 and she wants to explore since we're both each other's first.

I still love her a lot and we agreed to just give each other a week but I cannot resist myself from sending her our memories or wanting to talk to her. My heart stings really bad because she was a big big part of my life for a long time and now my life feels meaningless when I go to work or school. 

I feel horrible every minute especially when I wake up and when I'm at home alone, what should I do about this? Should I wait at her house or txt her today ( its been 3 days )? I feel so helpless, lonely and sad and all I want is her..

TITLE: (19m) I have some unresolved issues and it is plaguing my relationship with my (18f) girlfriend...

POST: So, I don't usually post this kind of stuff but I honestly don't know who to turn to for help. Since I was 14 I have had a crush on my best friend (well... more than a crush) and she has had the same feelings for me. However, we were both too scared to make the first move and entered a bit of a stalemate for four years before she got asked out by some guy and I tried to move on. I started dating my girlfriend shortly afterwards and it lasted about 8 months, then things fell on the rocks on account of an acquaintance of ours and she dumped me. We are giving it a second go but things are still really shaky and one of the biggest problems is the situation with my aforementioned best friend... We still have strong feelings for each other and almost every night after she's had a few and I'm honestly too exhausted to give a damn (pretending not to have feelings is hard ok?) we always turn to talking about how things could have been and how we each wanted the other to make the first move. My girlfriend has started to notice the tension and fully expects me to dump her though I have no intention of doing so... Also I should mention that one of my exes came out of the woodwork, falsely accused me of sleeping with and impregnating her and told my current girlfriend who now has no faith in me at all. Her parents also hate me due to the original scandal with the mutual acquaintance and for some reason, she is blaming herself for all of this and wants me to dump her while also not wanting me to dump her... CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME? Thank you in advance...

TL;DR: I have unresolved feelings for my best friend who I've had a crush on since 14. We never made a move and I started dating my current girlfriend. We're giving it a second try but the tension between me and my best friend is causing issues. My girlfriend has lost faith in me due to false accusations from an ex and her parents hate me. I don't know what to do.

TITLE: Hit a wall, or fell off a cliff, during my marathon training

POST: I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?

TL;DR: I've been training for my first half and full marathons, but after a two-week trip, I can't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing steam. I've tried to troubleshoot and have a few guesses, but I'm worried I've hit a wall or fallen off a cliff. Help! 

**Comments:**

* "I think it's the change of bed. I had a similar experience when I switched hotels for a work trip. Try running on a new route or at a different time to see if that helps."
* "I had a similar experience when I switched to morning runs. It took me a few weeks to adjust, but once I did, I was back to my normal self. Try sticking to your new morning routine and see if it improves."
* "I think it's the diet change. When I increased my calorie intake, I felt like I was carrying extra weight and my runs suffered. Try going back to your old diet and see if that helps."
* "I had a similar experience when I reduced my alcohol consumption. It took me a few weeks to adjust, but once I did, I felt more energetic and my runs improved. Try increasing your water intake and see if that helps."
* "I think it's a combination of factors. Try to identify what's changed and see if you can adjust back to your normal routine. Good luck with your training!"
* "I had a similar experience when I changed my running shoes. Try switching back to your old shoes and see if that helps."
* "I think it's the stress of travel. Try to relax and see if that helps. You can also try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine, like yoga or meditation."
* "I had a similar experience when I changed my running route. Try running on a new route and see if that helps."
* "I think it's the lack of consistency. Try to stick to your normal running routine and see if that helps. Consistency is key when it comes to training for a marathon."
* "I had a similar experience when I changed my running pace. Try to go back to your normal pace and see if that helps."
* "I think it's the lack of rest. Try to get more rest and see if that helps. You can also try to incorporate some rest days into your routine."
* "I had a similar experience when I changed my running distance. Try to go back to your normal distance and see if that helps."
* "I think it's the lack of variety. Try to mix up your runs and see if that helps. You can also try to incorporate some strength training into your routine."

TITLE: I've [23 M] started dating a lovely woman [23 F], what does she mean?

POST: OK, so I've started to date (4 dates so far) this woman who is really nice. We met at a college extra curricular lecture and things have been going swimmingly. My issue is me I believe, and I really could do with some advice.

So I'm really inexperienced with women and I'm pretty much flying by the seat of my pants right now and just trying to keep my head above the water so I'm doing my best to try and not scare this woman away. In my quest to do this, I've realised that I haven't really initialised any physical contact and it has all come from her. So for instance, at the end of the second date she gave me a peck on the cheek as way of saying good night. After the fourth date, I was still scared of offending her by holding her hand and putting my arm around her (I not a smooth man!) and she ended to date by just gunning for it and sucking my face off (totally not complaining!). Anyway, I decided to text her that I really like her and that the reason I haven't made a move yet is because I wasn't sure she'd appreciate it. She text back saying that she's not looking to rush into anything and moving slowly is maybe the way to go but she really enjoyed the evening as is looking forward to our next date. What does she mean by this?

TL;DR: I'm a 23-year-old guy who's dating a 23-year-old woman. I'm inexperienced and haven't initiated any physical contact. She's been making the moves. I texted her saying I like her and that I was hesitant to make a move. She said she's not looking to rush into anything and moving slowly is maybe the way to go. What does she mean by this?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "She means she's not looking to rush into anything, like sex or a serious relationship. She's enjoying the slow pace and getting to know you better. Don't overthink it, just keep being yourself and see where things go."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "I think you're reading too much into it. She's just saying that she's not in a rush to get physical or serious. It's not a rejection, it's just a sign that she's taking things slow and enjoying the process. Keep being respectful and see where things go."
3. **u/awkward_dude**: "Dude, I feel you. I'm in a similar situation. I think she's just saying that she's not looking to rush into anything because she's not ready for a serious relationship. It's not a bad thing, just means she's taking her time. Keep being yourself and don't worry too much about it."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit too optimistic here. She might be saying that she's not looking to rush into anything because she's not interested in you romantically. Don't get your hopes up too high, just keep being respectful and see how things go."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're reading the situation correctly. She's saying that she's not looking to rush into anything because she's taking things slow and getting to know you better. It's a sign that she's interested in you, just not in a rush to get physical or serious. Keep being respectful and see where things go."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I was just overthinking things. I'll just keep being myself and see where things go. I'm really enjoying getting to know her and I think we have a good connection. I'll just take things slow and see what happens. Thanks again for the advice!"

TITLE: Tricked into monogamy

POST: 26, f here. I started having sex with this 31 year old guy I know through friends, thinking he was casual about relationships. 1.5 years later I suddenly find myself hearing about how I'm spending too much time with other guys and he doesn't feel like I'm that into him. I do try to make him feel loved, but I thought we agreed from the start that this isn't what we want.

We both want this relationship, but disagree on the terms. I don't want to be exclusive, but I want him. Why is it that the one who wants the exclusivity always seems to be more in a position to make demands, even when otherwise was specified from the start? The advice I get is "Leave, you want different things" or "If you like him he should be enough". Why is the jealous one assumed to be the one who'd have the hardest time giving the other person what they need? 

And yes, we have talked. He won't have it and he's making me feel like the one that's breaking us up. 

I'm not talking about fucking lots of guys, even kissing is off the table.

TL;DR: Tricked into monogamy, want to keep the relationship but not exclusive, partner wants exclusivity and is making demands.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're in a situation where you're not getting what you want, and that's okay. It's not uncommon for people to change their minds or have different expectations. If you're not ready to commit to exclusivity, it might be best to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and boundaries. If they're not willing to compromise, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "It's not uncommon for people to feel trapped or stuck in a situation where they're not getting what they want. In this case, it sounds like you're feeling trapped in a monogamous relationship that you didn't initially agree to. It's important to remember that you have the power to change your own life and make decisions that align with your own desires and needs. If you're not happy with the current state of your relationship, it might be time to consider making some changes or having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and boundaries."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure why you're surprised that the person who wants exclusivity is making demands. It's not uncommon for people to want to feel secure and committed in a relationship. If you're not willing to commit to exclusivity, it's understandable that your partner might feel frustrated or hurt. It's important to remember that relationships are about compromise and communication. If you're not willing to work together to find a solution that works for both of you, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."

TITLE: (18/M) Don't know if I should pursue her(17/F), some opinions would be nice.

POST: So I just want to clarify that no I'm not a anti-social guy who is being friendzoned by a girl who is out of my league.

So I'm taking a friend of mine who is super pretty to my matric dance(prom) and I started becoming more interested in her after I asked her to go with me on a date. So I asked her and we are planning to go on a date after I finish writing my exams and before the dance(prom), and she seemed keen when I asked her so I guess that's something to go on. Also at the beginning of the year my one friend tried to set the both of us up to go out and from what he told me she was interested in me but it never happened because we just weren't comfortable with each other then and it was difficult to speak to her at first.

Now the problems start with the fact that I'm moving next year to another city 12 hours away from where we live to go to varsity. Now I stay committed when I get into relationships but long distance would be tough on me and I'm not sure about her. I brought it up with her before I asked her out that I'm going to be leaving and she seemed pretty disappointed by it.

The second problem for me is that this year was also the first time I've been in love with someone and the first time a girl rejected me when I asked her out - this is a long complicated story I don't wanna explain XD. Anyway some days she would pop up in my mind and I would get bummed out about it and also somebody in my grade is bringing her to the dance so that kinda sucks a little. After I stopped speaking to this girl that I fell in love with the girl I'm taking to the dance seemed to become a little bit more interested in me and started talking to me more often.

TL;DR: I'm taking a girl to my matric dance, we're going on a date before the dance, but I'm worried about the distance we'll have to deal with next year when I move away. I'm also worried about the fact that I've never been in a relationship before and I'm not sure if I'm ready for one. Some advice would be nice.

* "Dude, you're 18 and she's 17. That's a big age gap. You should probably focus on your own life and not get too caught up in a relationship right now."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just enjoy the date and see where things go. You can always reassess the situation when you're in a different city next year."
* "I'm not sure if you're ready for a relationship either. You've never been in one before and you're moving away soon. Maybe you should focus on yourself and your own goals before getting into something serious."
* "I think you're being too focused on the distance thing. If you really care about her, you'll find a way to make it work. But if you're not willing to put in the effort, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship."
* "I'm not sure if I would pursue a relationship with someone who is moving away soon. It's a lot of uncertainty and stress. Maybe you should focus on building a connection with her and see if it's worth the risk."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're 18, it's normal to not know what you want. Just enjoy the date and see where things go. You can always reassess the situation later."
* "I'm not sure if I would recommend pursuing a relationship with someone who is 17. It's a big age gap and it's not always easy to navigate. Maybe you should focus on building a connection with her and see if it's worth the risk."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just enjoy the date and see where things go. You can always reassess the situation when you're in a different city next year." (again)

This post is a good example of how people on the internet can provide conflicting and sometimes unhelpful advice. Some people are telling the OP to focus on himself and his own goals, while others are telling him to just enjoy the date and see where things go. Some people are also bringing up the age gap between the OP and the girl he's interested in, which could be a valid concern. Overall, it's a good idea for the OP to take all of this advice with a grain of salt and make his own decision about what to do.

TITLE: My (22M) girlfriend (20F) of one year can't be alone and I am afraid it will drive us apart.

POST: I wanna preface this by saying I have two different questions,  but they both seem to stem from the same issue. 

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly a year now and the relationship has been great. We're both pretty different people,  but we have been able to work out whatever issues have come up except for this one; she cannot be alone and I feel like a dick when I need alone time. 

I spend nearly every waking moment with her and while I love the time we spend together,  I need some time to focus on myself and do some things I enjoy, like video games, that she doesn't want to be a part of. I rarely get any such time because she needs someone to be with her. 
She has some pretty severe depression and while shes on medication for it, there are times that it only helps so much. There have been nights where she has talked about killing herself or starting drugs and I rush to her. When its normal and I leave, she is sad, but tells me its okay. I feel like a dick for taking time for myself and worry because I want her to be okay. I don't know how to convey that I need space for myself without making her think I don't want to spend time with her.      

This leads me to my second problem; I'm leaving for law school in about six months and im very worried about leaving her alone and being unable to be there for her. 

I have tried to bring it up before,  but she threw it back to me and said I was calling her crazy and that I wanted to break up with her. I'm just very scared of her doing something serious to herself when I can't be there for her and I don't want any resentment to come from this. I told her she needs to work on this, but her reasoning is that shes going to be okay the next day so it's okay, I disagree though. She has admitted that she can't be alone which frustrates me even more that she won't try to get help. I don't want to do a long distance relationship only for her to tell me that she needs someone around.

TL;DR: Girlfriend can't be alone and I need some time for myself. She has depression and I'm worried about leaving her alone for law school. I don't know how to convey that I need space without making her think I don't want to spend time with her.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not a bad person for needing alone time. It's normal and healthy. You need to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and what you need. Maybe you can find ways to compromise, like setting aside dedicated time for her and then taking some time for yourself. It's not about abandoning her, it's about taking care of yourself too."
* "I think you're being really understanding and empathetic towards her struggles with depression. It's great that you're willing to support her. However, you also need to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Maybe you can suggest therapy for her, or even couples therapy, to help her work through her feelings of loneliness and anxiety. It's not about abandoning her, it's about helping her find ways to cope and feel more comfortable being alone."
* "I think you're being really selfish here. You're not considering the fact that she's struggling with depression and needs someone to be there for her. You're not thinking about how she's going to feel when you leave for law school and she's left alone. You need to put her needs before your own and be there for her, even if it's hard for you."
* "I think you're being really unfair to her. You're not giving her the support and understanding she needs. You're not considering the fact that she's struggling with depression and needs someone to be there for her. You need to be more understanding and empathetic towards her struggles."
* "I think you're being really brave for sharing this and seeking help. It's not easy to talk about these things, but it's important to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Maybe you can find ways to compromise, like setting aside dedicated time for her and then taking some time for yourself. It's not about abandoning her, it's about taking care of yourself too."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people agreeing that the OP needs to prioritize his own needs and well-being, while others think he's being selfish and not considering his girlfriend's struggles with depression. Some people suggest that the OP and his girlfriend should seek couples therapy to work through their issues, while others think that the OP should be more understanding and empathetic towards his girlfriend's struggles. Ultimately, the OP needs to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his needs and boundaries, and work together to find a compromise that works for both of them.

TITLE: Having relationship problema because of too much sex

POST: Its kinda odd that our relationship has been starting to hit rocky shores because of this topic but it seems very reasonable. My girlfriend and I (both 17) are starting to have relationship problems, as we are starting to fight more, get in more arguments and just frankly not get along too well. 

We've been dating for more than a year and our sex life has been better than excellent. But it's starting to come to the point now that she feels that all I am interested in half the time is just having sex since it is all we do. Whenever were at each others houses we always have sex like its a given as to what we would do that day. She thinks that it's starting to take a toll on our relationship as we can't do anything but have sex like hangout without it. Obviously I love her so very much and don't want our relationship to end but it seems its very close to the finish. 

I really want to change our ways because I do believe half of it is my fault because of how horny I am. (trust me she is also very horny too) I don't know why but it always seems I get too heated in the moment and want to rip my clothes off and have sex with her but I really need to control that now since she sees the negatives of only having sex. we both go to school at the moment so we don't spend that much time together other than school so when we do see each other we are going to have sex. what should I do if I want to try and fix my relationship as its too based on the sex we have? (ofc its not the ONLY thing we do but it is a good portion) I love her and I really want to fix things as I understand how she feels and how she thinks our relationship is too based on sex. Would love to hear some of your guyss opinions and stories.

TL;DR: 17-year-old guy having relationship problems because sex is taking over his relationship. He wants to fix things and make it more balanced.

RESPONSES:

1. **OP's friend**: Dude, I'm glad you're recognizing the problem and wanting to fix it. It's not uncommon for young couples to get caught up in the excitement of sex, but it's great that you're willing to work on it. Have you talked to your girlfriend about how you feel? Maybe you can start by having an open and honest conversation about your desires and boundaries. It might be helpful to set some rules or boundaries for when you're together, like taking breaks from sex or doing other activities together. Remember, communication is key in any relationship.

2. **Relationship expert**: Hi OP, I'm glad you're seeking help for your relationship. It's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to work on it. One thing you might consider is setting aside dedicated time for non-sexual activities together. This could be as simple as going for a walk, watching a movie, or playing a game. This can help you reconnect and build intimacy in other ways. Additionally, you might consider having a conversation with your girlfriend about what she needs from your relationship. Is there something specific that's making her feel like the relationship is too focused on sex? By listening to her concerns and working together, you can find a balance that works for both of you.

3. **Anonymous poster**: OP, I'm 25 and I went through a similar situation with my ex. We were both super horny and it was all we did, but it started to take a toll on our relationship. I think what helped us was setting boundaries and making a conscious effort to do other things together. We started going on hikes, trying new restaurants, and just doing normal couple stuff. It wasn't easy, but it helped us reconnect and find a balance. I think it's great that you're recognizing the problem and wanting to fix it. Just remember that it's okay to take things slow and not rush into sex all the time. You can still be intimate and loving without having sex every time you're together.

4. **Skeptical poster**: OP, I'm not sure I buy this whole "we're too focused on sex" thing. You're 17, you're in high school, and you're dating a girl who's also 17. Of course you're going to want to have sex! It's natural. Maybe you're just getting bored with the relationship and looking for an excuse to break up. I'm not saying that's the case, but it's something to consider. Have you tried doing other things together? Like, have you gone on a date or done something fun that doesn't involve sex? If not, maybe you should try that before blaming the sex for your relationship problems.

5. **Supportive poster**: OP, I'm glad you're recognizing the problem and wanting to work on it. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're not happy in a relationship. I think it's great that you're willing to make changes and find a balance. Remember that relationships are a journey, and it's okay to have ups and downs. Just keep communicating with your girlfriend and working together to find what works for both of you. And hey, if all else fails, you can always try couples therapy! It's a great way to work through issues and find a solution that works for both of you. Good luck, OP!

TITLE: TIFU by letting 13 year old girls play with my DJ set before my show.

POST: So I was playing a bar mitzvah, it was actually my first DJ gig as an official DJ, I'd played house parties and stuff but this was my first time getting paid. Anyway, for all the parties I used a pair of computer speakers, Alesis Elevate 3s if you must know, but this was a bigger venue so I decided to use a different setup. 

I used my big huge Klipsch kt-lcr speakers but I couldn't find an amplifier, so I used my AM/FM stereo, a fairly nice one from the 90's, I'd been DJing with this setup in my bedroom for a while and everything worked fine if you kept the bass down a little. 

I got to the party a little bit too early and I was still setting up. The bar mitzvah kid's twin comes up with one of her friends and asks if they can play with my set. It's all setup so I thought "Eh, what could possibly go wrong" I delve under the mess of wires and cords to setup a few lights when I smell a plasticy smell and start to see smoke.

The noise starts to spontaneously weird out, the bass cutting in and out, until it just stops altogether. Anyway I come out from under the set and look at my board, the girls had cranked the bass and were scratching. I couldn't really tell about the bass, the speakers were pretty bassy and they were scratching. I shooed them off and thought maybe they were messing with the high-pass. I cue up another song and I hear a groan from my setup and then smell more smoke. I finally see it.

My FM/AM receiver is in flames. I immediately unplug it and start waving away the smoke, the fire has already started to go out. I wait a couple minutes for it to cool then try to play something else, but the lights on the stereo won't even come on. I had to play the rest of the show through the bar mitzvah's crappy bass amp.

TL;DR: I let 13 year old girls play with my DJ set before my show and they managed to set my FM/AM receiver on fire.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a humorous and relatable tale of how they messed up in a situation. In this case, the OP let 13-year-old girls play with their DJ set before a show, which resulted in them setting the FM/AM receiver on fire.

The post is well-written and engaging, with a clear and concise summary of what happened. The OP also includes some fun details, such as the type of speakers they used and the fact that they had to play the rest of the show through the bar mitzvah's crappy bass amp.

The post has received a lot of attention and engagement on the subreddit, with many users commenting and sharing their own similar experiences. The post has also been upvoted many times, indicating that it is a popular and well-received story. Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story and is a fun and relatable read.

TITLE: I need some advice!!

POST: I wanna start off with a back story. I've been overweight for as long as I can remember... I really first noticed it when I was about 9-10 years old at that point I tried to become more active but shortly lost it when my dad got a new job. Around that same time I had also expressed to my mom that I felt food was the only friend I had and was the only friend that could move with us. Fast forward to when I was a freshman in HS I became increasingly more active because I didn't have a bus to take me to school and back. At this point my mom decided to put the family on weight watchers and we got a gym membership.  I went from being 230 lbs to being 175! I felt awesome but still had a bit more to go! I kept most of that weight off for a year until my mom stopped trying anymore and started making and buying crap foods. 
I'm now 22 years, 5'11", and a whopping 250 lbs. I'm done with it! I want to lose the weight! I envision myself about 100 lbs smaller! My biggest road blocks at this point, my husband doesn't need to lose weight, healthy food is expensive, and I have a slipped vertebra and bulging disc in my lower back.. exercising too much causes excruciating pain. 

Basically I need advice.  What should I do, how should I do it, is there anything that's helped jumpstart your weight lose endeavours? I know I just need to do it, but how?  How can I just do something when it feels like all odds are stacked against me...?

TL;DR: I'm 22, 250 lbs, and I'm done with being overweight. I've tried before, but I've hit a wall. I'm looking for advice on how to start and maintain a weight loss journey, despite my husband not needing to lose weight, healthy food being expensive, and having a slipped vertebra and bulging disc in my lower back that makes exercising too much painful.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT COMMUNITY:**

1. **Start small**: Don't try to change everything at once. Start with small, achievable goals, like taking a 10-minute walk each day or replacing one unhealthy meal with a healthy one.
2. **Consult a doctor**: Before starting any new exercise or diet plan, consult with your doctor, especially considering your slipped vertebra and bulging disc. They can help you create a personalized plan that takes your health concerns into account.
3. **Focus on progress, not perfection**: It's okay to have setbacks or not see immediate results. Focus on the progress you're making, and celebrate small victories along the way.
4. **Find healthy, affordable food options**: Look for affordable, healthy food options like beans, lentils, and frozen vegetables. You can also try meal prepping or cooking in bulk to save time and money.
5. **Find exercises that work for you**: Consider low-impact exercises like yoga, swimming, or cycling, which may be easier on your back. You can also try bodyweight exercises or resistance band workouts.
6. **Support system**: Having a supportive partner can make a big difference. Try to involve your husband in your weight loss journey, even if it's just by being a sounding board for your progress and struggles.
7. **Celebrate milestones**: Celebrate your small victories along the way, like reaching a new low weight or completing a challenging workout. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.
8. **Be patient**: Losing weight and maintaining weight loss takes time. Be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged by setbacks or plateaus.
9. **Seek online resources**: There are many online resources and communities dedicated to weight loss and healthy living. Look for recipes, workout plans, and motivational stories to help inspire and guide you.
10. **Remember, you're not alone**: Many people have successfully lost weight and maintained their weight loss. Remember that you're not alone in your journey, and there are people who understand and can support you.

---

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:**

* **Weight loss apps**: Consider using weight loss apps like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, or Weight Watchers to track your progress, set goals, and receive support.
* **Online communities**: Join online communities like Reddit's r/loseit, r/weightloss, or r/fitness to connect with others who are on a similar journey.
* **Health and wellness websites**: Visit websites like the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, or the National Institute on Aging for reliable information on healthy living and weight loss.
* **Consult a registered dietitian**: Consider consulting a registered dietitian or a nutritionist to create a personalized meal plan that meets your dietary needs and preferences.

TITLE: [19F] I have a gross girly crush on a co-worker [21M] but I don't know whether to give up or pursue

POST: Throwaway because my manager is a redditor.

I started work at a college job a few months ago, first started off because I needed money, but now I really love it and I would hate to leave my job. My shifts are timetabled around availability and lectures so sometimes I won't see some of the people on my team for weeks at a time. Worked my first shift with one of my coworkers a couple months ago and my first reaction was that he is totally my type but I should just get over it because I should be professional. Work a couple more shifts with him and we talk during the breaks about our interests, and he'd always greet me with a smile and ask me about my day. He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.

Then I fucked up and caught feelings. 

Here's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work.

TL;DR: I have a crush on a coworker who I haven't seen in months, and I don't know whether to pursue it or just forget about it.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's been months since you've seen him, and you're still holding onto these feelings. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether this crush is worth pursuing. You're right that it could make things awkward at work, and it's not like you're going to see him every day anyway."
* "I think you should try to talk to him when you see him again. Just casually, like 'hey, how's it going?' or something. If he seems interested, then maybe you can take it from there. But if he doesn't seem interested, then it's probably best to just leave it alone."
* "I don't think it's weird to have feelings for someone, even if you haven't seen them in a while. But I do think you should be careful about how you approach it. Maybe try to get to know him better as a person before you start thinking about romantic feelings. And definitely don't do anything that could make things awkward at work."
* "I think you should just focus on your work and not worry about it too much. You're right that he's graduating soon, so it's not like it's going to be a long-term thing anyway. Just enjoy your time at work and don't stress too much about it."
* "I think you should try to get to know him better as a person before you start thinking about romantic feelings. Maybe try to find some common interests or hobbies that you both enjoy. And definitely don't do anything that could make things awkward at work."

---

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'm going to take your advice and try to talk to him casually when I see him again. I'll just try to get to know him better as a person and see if there's any mutual interest. And if not, then I'll just leave it alone and focus on my work. Thanks for the help!

TITLE: I (21m) seeking advices with (21f) i've been seeing/dating.

POST: so i (21m)'ve been seeing this girl (21f), we went on couple dates and its pretty clear that we like each other, the problem is that after our lunch date today, she drove us back to her college, and about to go to a show with her friend, i was gonna meet up with my mate from the same college, anyway, of the all the recent times we caught up, we either end it with kisses or at least hug, but nope she didnt do either today, the scenario was us two and her friend, i thought she was in a rush so didn't worry about it coz i was planning to see her again after i caught up with my mate. i asked her when does the show finish, she told me its 3hrs ish, i told her i might still be around, told her to text me when it finishes. time forward 3hrs(we actually studied in the 3hrs time), didnt get a reply from her, so i started leaving her college, on the way out, of course she is on her way back, this time with our common friend (20f), so we(3 of us) chatted for a bit(like normal friend convo for couple minutes) it was getting weird, so i was like ok im gonna go now, i was expecting she'd come give me a hug or something but nope again, she's acting like we are normal friends and still havent heard from her....

so what do you guys think? we actually never discussed what we are, but i know for sure she's not that type of girl who wants a fling, she wants something serious. now i think about it, when there are people around us who know her, she wouldn't hold my hand or anything intimate, only when we are alone, she'd let me hold her hands and make out.

TL;DR: I've been seeing this girl, we've had a good connection, but after our last date, she didn't give me a hug or kiss, and when I saw her with our common friend, she acted like we're just friends. I'm worried that she's not interested in me or that she's playing games.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, it sounds like she's not interested in you. She's been playing it cool and not making any moves when you're around others. If she wanted something serious, she'd be making an effort to show you affection in front of others too. I'd take this as a sign that she's not the one for you."
2. **u/datingadviceguru**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It's possible that she's not interested in you, but it's also possible that she's just not comfortable showing affection in public. However, if she's not making an effort to see you or communicate with you, it's likely that she's not interested. I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see how she responds."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I think you're overthinking this. Maybe she just didn't feel like being all lovey-dovey in front of her friend. And maybe she was just busy and forgot to text you. Don't read too much into it. Just chill and see how things go. If she's not interested, you'll find out soon enough."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just shy or not used to showing affection in public. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's just not used to expressing her feelings in a way that you're expecting. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her and see where it takes you."
5. **u/realistic_rick**: "I think you're being too clingy. You've only been seeing her for a few dates, and you're already expecting her to be all affectionate and stuff. Chill out, dude. Just enjoy the ride and see where things go. If she's not interested, you'll find out soon enough. Don't put too much pressure on it."

TITLE: Friend (M/19) talking to girl that hit on me (M/19) previously. Do I tell him?

POST: So I am extremely good friends with one of my bros. I used to work at a low paying job and I knew this girl who also worked there. She texted me multiple times and it was kind of weird. She seemed a little bit like a slut but I'm not one to judge. I was 100% not interested in her but she kept texting. It never went anywhere just so you guys know.

However, my friend went out on a date tonight and I found out that it's the same girl! I know if she ever hangs out with our "friend group" she will recognize me and it will be weird. Should I tell him that the girl tried to hit on me? Do I sweep it under the carpet and not tell him? I personally don't think it's a big deal but it could get weird if they become more serious. I want the best for my friend and I don't want him to have his heart broken by a girl who is a slut and doesn't want the best for him

TL;DR: Friend went on a date with a girl who hit on me previously. Should I tell him or keep it to myself?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma that many people face in their personal relationships. The OP (original poster) is torn between whether to tell his friend about the girl's previous advances or to keep it to himself.

The post highlights the complexity of the situation, as the OP is unsure of how his friend will react to the information. He is also concerned about the potential consequences of telling his friend, including the possibility of ruining their friendship or causing his friend to become upset or angry.

The post also raises questions about the nature of the girl and her intentions. The OP describes her as "a little bit like a slut," which suggests that he may have a negative view of her. However, he also acknowledges that he is not one to judge and that he was not interested in her advances.

Overall, the post is an example of the kinds of complex and nuanced situations that people often face in their personal relationships. It highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of our actions and the need to communicate openly and honestly with those around us.

TITLE: Playing tug-of-war with kids over stuff they're not supposed to be playing with... what do?

POST: I don't have a ton of experience babysitting, but I'm about to become an au pair and I want to work out a couple kinks.

How do you deal with kids who won't give you something they're not supposed to have when you ask for it? For example, I'm babysitting my little cousins tonight and I had to yank the remote control out of a 20-month-old's hands. I asked her for the remote (her brother was watching the TV or I wouldn't have cared) and tried to take it from her gently, but I ended up having to yank it away from her with more force than I would have liked to use with someone so little. The resulting tantrum was epic. I didn't like grabbing something from her somewhat harshly and was wondering if there's a better way to go about getting them to drop something they won't return. Or am I just being a sissy?

Thanks!

TL;DR: How do you deal with kids who won't give you something they're not supposed to have when you ask for it? I yanked a remote control away from a 20-month-old and got an epic tantrum. Is there a better way to handle this?

---

**Comments:**

* "Oh girl, you're not being a sissy at all! 20 months is a great age for tantrums, and it's normal for them to test boundaries. Next time, try saying 'I see you're really enjoying that remote! Can I help you find something else to play with?' and then offer an alternative toy. Sometimes they just need a little redirection."
* "I'm an au pair too, and I've learned that when they're really attached to something, it's better to just let them have it for a little while. Like, if they're obsessed with a certain toy, just let them play with it for 10 minutes and then take it away. It's better than trying to take it away abruptly. Also, try to make eye contact and speak calmly when asking for something back. It helps them feel more secure."
* "I'm a mom of three, and I can attest that tantrums are just part of the job! But seriously, try using a 'gentle but firm' approach. When you ask for the remote, say 'I need the remote, sweetie. Can you give it to me?' and then use a gentle but firm tone when taking it away. Don't apologize or make excuses, just be calm and assertive. And remember, it's okay to say 'no' sometimes!"
* "I've found that when kids are really attached to something, it's often because they're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. Try to identify what's causing the attachment and address that instead of just taking the thing away. For example, if they're attached to the remote because they're feeling anxious about the TV turning off, try to find a way to calm them down before taking the remote away."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all so much for your responses! I really appreciate the advice and reassurance. I think I was worried that I was being too soft or too harsh, but it sounds like I was just doing what I needed to do in the moment. I'll definitely try some of the strategies you all suggested, like offering alternatives and using a gentle but firm tone. And I love the idea of identifying what's causing the attachment and addressing that instead of just taking the thing away. Thanks again for your help and support!"

TITLE: I (M/23) have serious troubles (on my part) communicating and relating to my mother.

POST: I have never really been able to talk to my mom easily. My parents divorced when I was about 3, and I have always been a bit of a troublesome and angry kid (and now adult). She is way more extroverted than I am and talks far more than I do. She has always been understanding, helpful, and supportive of whatever I do (despite being quite controlling of my life), but for some fucked up reason I resent her. Whenever her and I are alone I feel agitated, frustrated, and annoyed, so I just can't have a proper conversation without getting sarcastic and snippy, and shooting down what she says.

I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me, and it has been eating me up for my whole life and I don't know how to fix it. It feels like there is a mental block in my mind that prevents me from having a positive relationship with her, and I feel like I need some sort of therapy to fix it. She has been nothing but tolerant of me my entire life, despite me being a shithead most of the time.

The thing is I want to be able to relate to her, and I know that's all she wants, but my mind will absolutely not let me do it. Whenever I'm by myself I hate myself for being such a bad son. Has anybody had any experience with this, or have any advice about it? Thanks.

I'm fully aware of how much of a bad son this makes me, but I can't change it.

TL;DR: I have trouble communicating and relating to my mother due to my own issues, and I'm looking for advice on how to overcome this.

---

**Comments:**

* "Hey OP, I'm not a therapist, but I can tell you that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with relating to their parents, especially if there was a divorce involved. It sounds like you're aware of your own flaws and are willing to work on it, which is a huge step. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you work through some of these issues and develop healthier communication habits."
* "I can totally relate to this. I had a similar situation with my mom, and it wasn't until I started seeing a therapist that I was able to work through some of the underlying issues. One thing that helped me was to start small - instead of trying to have a huge, deep conversation with my mom, I started with small, everyday interactions. Like, we'd talk about our days or what we were watching on TV. It wasn't about having some profound conversation, but just about being present and engaged with each other. Maybe try that with your mom?"
* "OP, I think it's really brave of you to acknowledge your own flaws and be willing to work on them. That takes a lot of courage. I'm not a therapist, but I do think that therapy could be really helpful for you. It might also be helpful to try to understand where your mom is coming from - like, what's driving her behavior and what's she trying to get from you? Sometimes, when we can understand the other person's perspective, it can help us feel less resentful and more empathetic."
* "I think it's great that you're aware of your own flaws and are willing to work on them. That's the first step to making positive changes. Have you considered journaling or writing about your feelings and thoughts? Sometimes putting your thoughts down on paper can help you process and understand them better. You could also try talking to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings - sometimes just sharing your thoughts with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and understood."
* "OP, I think it's really important to remember that you're not alone in this. A lot of people struggle with relating to their parents, and it's not because there's anything wrong with you. It's just that relationships can be complicated, and it takes work to build and maintain them. I think it's great that you're willing to put in the effort to improve your relationship with your mom. Keep being honest with yourself and trying to work through your issues, and I'm sure you'll get there eventually."

TITLE: TIFU by falling asleep in my bros bed

POST: Alright, so this happened two days ago, on saturday afternoon. To set the scene, I go to a pretty large school in the south and the weekends pretty consist of drinking a lot and socializing. I got to the house where a few of my bros live at around 4 and to kill the time we decided to through a movie on and chill until it was time to start drinking and go out. HBO recently started carrying Bulletproof Monk so we throw that on. Turns out its fucking awful. I end up falling asleep on the end of his bed laying ~~horizontally~~ like a dog.

     Falling asleep was the beginning of my fuck up. I briefly remember a nightmare of being chased by some hellacious creature, I turn back to look at it while running, but cannot find it. I look forward. BANG I hit something.

     So I come to stumbling up the stairs of my bud's house with a massive headache, not knowing what the fuck has happened to me. I  rub my head (much to my chagrin it feels like its been beaten worse Denver in the super bowl last year) and find my hand covered in blood. I basically fall into the living room where all my friends are drinking and ask what the hell is going on and what happened. I simply can't talk and am concussed as fuck. I walk into the bathroom to find a major gash at the top of my head and blood all down my face. The next thirty minutes is comprised of me being in complete shock, not knowing where I am, and wondering what happened to me. I finally gather myself and start cutting up with my friends. This is when the guy who's room I fell asleep in walks through the front door holding a golf club... Not pointing fingers, but seriously, i'm suspicious now. 

**TIFU** by falling asleep on a bed doggy style, having my best friend hit me in the head with his golf club and being majorly concussed.

TL;DR: Fell asleep on my bro's bed, had a nightmare, hit my head, and woke up with a concussion. My bro might have hit me with his golf club. 

**Edit:** I just got a text from my bro saying "Dude, I'm really sorry about what happened. I didn't hit you with my golf club, but I did find you on my bed and I was really freaked out. I didn't know what to do, so I just left you there and went to get some help. I'm really sorry, man." I guess I'm just glad it wasn't him. Still, I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a headache for the rest of my life. 

**Edit 2:** I just got a second text from my bro saying "Also, I think you might have hit your head on the ceiling fan. I'm really sorry, man." I guess that explains the blood and the concussion. I'm just glad I didn't die. 

**Edit 3:** I just got a third text from my bro saying "Dude, I'm really sorry again. I think I'm going to have to tell our friends what happened. I don't want to, but I think it's the right thing to do. I'll talk to you later, man." I guess I'm going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 4:** I just got a fourth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just told our friends what happened. They're all laughing and joking about it. I'm really sorry, man. I didn't mean to make you look like a fool." I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the embarrassment of my actions. 

**Edit 5:** I just got a fifth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 6:** I just got a sixth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 7:** I just got a seventh text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 8:** I just got a eighth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 9:** I just got a ninth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 10:** I just got a tenth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 11:** I just got a eleventh text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

**Edit 12:** I just got a twelfth text from my bro saying "Dude, I just got a text from our friend saying 'I'm still laughing about that time you fell asleep on your bro's bed and hit your head on the ceiling fan.' I guess I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences of my actions.

TITLE: I'[M21] worried and she's [19] confused

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been going together for a little over one month and things have begun to get a little hot and heavy. Passionate make out sessions, heavy petting, etc. Now as things got pretty intense I see the definite signs of arousal, erect nipples, heavy breathing, dilated pupils, and she seems to be getting a little wet under her jeans.

 We break from anything more serious because time has become a factor but we just talk about what we enjoyed i learn some things about what turned her on but then she drops that she has considered herself asexual, but based on what both of us have seen that night she's in an interesting place.

To me she was clearly aroused and might have proceeded further, and she's not too sure what happened either as it's not how things usually are for her. I'm giving her time to think about everything and don't plan on pressuring her one way or another. I care about her enough to be fine with her if she feels like having sex with me or not. I just want other peoples input to assuage my worries, I'm just a worrying person.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been getting pretty intimate, but she's recently revealed she's asexual. She seemed aroused, but is unsure what happened and I'm worried about how to handle the situation.

COMMENTS:

* "Asexuality is a spectrum, and it's totally possible for someone to experience arousal without identifying as sexual. It's great that you're respecting her boundaries and giving her space to think about her feelings. Just remember to communicate openly and honestly with her about your own desires and boundaries."
* "I'm asexual and I can attest that it's not uncommon for us to experience arousal, especially in situations where we feel comfortable and connected with someone. It's not necessarily a contradiction to being asexual, but rather a sign that our brains are wired to respond to certain stimuli. It's great that you're taking the time to understand her feelings and boundaries."
* "It's awesome that you're prioritizing her feelings and boundaries over your own desires. That takes a lot of maturity and respect. Just remember to communicate openly and honestly with her about your own desires and boundaries, and try not to put too much pressure on her to make a decision."
* "I think it's great that you're giving her space to think about her feelings and boundaries. It's not uncommon for people to experience conflicting desires or feelings, especially when it comes to intimacy. Just remember to be patient and understanding, and try not to take it personally if she decides that she's not ready to engage in sexual activity."
* "I'm a little concerned that you're putting too much pressure on yourself to 'handle the situation' and 'assuage your worries.' It sounds like you're doing a great job of being respectful and understanding, and that's all you can really do. Try to focus on being present and supportive for your girlfriend, and trust that she'll make the right decision for herself."

Overall, the comments are supportive and understanding, with many people sharing their own experiences with asexuality and offering words of encouragement and advice. The OP is praised for being respectful and understanding, and is encouraged to continue communicating openly and honestly with his girlfriend. The comments also highlight the importance of patience and understanding in navigating complex emotional situations.

TITLE: Can we have a "Post Your Dress" thread?

POST: Hello /r/weddingplanning!

I am very new to this sub and I am obsessed! I'm not engaged yet myself but SO and I have talked a lot about it and it is in our near future for sure :) ANYWAYS. I'm specifically fascinated by all the wedding dress photos that people have been posting. One thing that I find myself constantly wondering as someone who will be shopping for one is 'WOW, how much does that beautiful thing cost??' **So I'm wondering if y'all would be ever so kind as to post photos of you wearing your dress as well as including the following info: dress name, cost, place of purchase, size?, and any other info you'd like to include regarding the dress.** I think this will be great to see all the posts in one place (and feed my new wedding planning obsession) :)

I realize that there are already subs dedicated to wedding dresses but they are so small. So I'm posting here in the hopes that we can get many people posting their dresses and then we can all gush over them in one place. 

And a side note on future individual dress posts:
Is anyone interested in making a'requirement' that dress posts include'stats' in the post title? Similar to how /r/progresspics requires body stats so we understand the context. This would include things that I mentioned above like dress name, price, place of purchase, etc. Can even include dress size for more context (unless poster is uncomfortable sharing that info). What do you think?

TL;DR: Can we have a "Post Your Dress" thread where people share photos of their wedding dresses along with details like dress name, cost, place of purchase, size, and any other info they'd like to share? Would love to see all the posts in one place and get inspiration for my own dress search!

* The thread becomes a popular and engaging part of the subreddit, with many users sharing their dresses and providing feedback and support to one another.

TITLE: Why don't self posts get karma?

POST: I understand that they used to and that people [complained] because there were lots of "vote up if" type posts that were getting karma. Removing karma from them, however, does not appear to have changed things. They've always been reported and deleted (none are on in the pages [archived by archive.org] for the time before it was removed). They still show up from time to time (despite it actually saying right above where I'm typing this "*Beginning your title with "vote up if" is violation of intergalactic law.*"), then they get reported and removed.

However, one effect that this has influenced is the creation of rage comics and an increase in screenshots. I've even noticed that increase just over the last year. Now, I'm not saying that they wouldn't happen if self posts got karma, nor that they are always inappropriate, but it is evident that there are some things that would be better as self posts that are instead posted as screen shots or rage comics and it's hard to not think that the lack of karma for self posts plays a part in this.

So, I think we should revisit this decision. It seems to me that self posts add original content to reddit and should be encouraged. This very, and very popular, subreddit is a perfect example. It accepts nothing *but* self posts. [IAmA] is another perfect example of a popular subreddit that is affected by this that is also quite popular. So, is there any reason we shouldn't start letting self posts get karma? If there is not, what kind of karma would be the most appropriate for them?

TL;DR: Self posts used to get karma, but were removed due to abuse. However, they still show up and are often reported and removed. I think we should reconsider this decision and allow self posts to get karma, as they add original content and are often used in popular subreddits.

---

This post is a discussion about the lack of karma for self posts on Reddit, a social news and discussion website. The author argues that self posts, which are posts made by the same user who created the post, should be allowed to get karma, as they add original content to the site and are often used in popular subreddits. The author notes that self posts were previously allowed to get karma, but were removed due to abuse, and that they still show up and are often reported and removed. The author suggests that the lack of karma for self posts may have contributed to the increase in screenshots and rage comics, and that allowing self posts to get karma could encourage more original content on the site.

The post is written in a clear and concise manner, and the author provides examples of popular subreddits that use self posts, such as r/AskReddit and r/IAmA. The author also acknowledges that there may be some abuse of self posts, but argues that this is not a reason to completely eliminate them. Overall, the post is well-written and presents a thoughtful and well-reasoned argument for allowing self posts to get karma.

TITLE: TIFU By not checking the showtimes online

POST: Little backstory: I live in Malaysia, work in Brunei (Google it if you don't know where these countries are)

So I watched Deadpool last week during the holidays with my friends and it was freaking awesome. Now that my holiday is over and I'm back at my work place, I've decided to watch it again with my colleagues.

I was hyping them up with all the fun Deadpool facts on the way to the cinema and they were super excited to watch it. Until we reach the cinema and noticed there were no showing of Deadpool. A quick Google revealed that it is banned in Brunei. Now I got 5 angry co -workers blaming me for getting them all excited for nothing.

TL;DR: I got my colleagues all excited to watch Deadpool, but it's banned in Brunei, so we couldn't watch it.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a story about a mistake they made and the consequences that followed. In this case, the author didn't check the showtimes online before heading to the cinema with their colleagues, and they ended up getting them all excited for a movie that is banned in Brunei.

The post is relatable and entertaining, and the author's use of humor and self-deprecation makes it an enjoyable read. The comments section is also filled with people sharing their own "TIFU" stories and offering words of encouragement and advice.

Overall, this post is a great example of how a well-written and engaging "TIFU" story can bring people together and create a sense of community on Reddit.

TITLE: Girlfriend has never instigated sex.  Not once.   Advice from women pleeeasseee.

POST: I am 21 and she is 20, we have been dating for about 19months.  

This being said, we are a very sexually active couple, being a 21-year old male, I have the sex-drive of a 21-year old male.   Because of this I know she is completely comfortable with sex, never once has she denied it and she is always into it, but not even once in almost *two years* has she instigated it.  I have brought it up to her so many times and everytime she just says sorry, but then it's instantly forgotten about and *nothing* changes.

I can't figure out what to do because theres clearly not much I can do to fix it if telling her about how much it bothers me has never changed anything in the long course of time that she has known its bothered me.

If you are wondering why it bothers me it is quite simple: I see sex, when in a relationship, as a very important thing and as the most explicit way to show someone you care about them if you're willing to let them see you completely naked and you will please them.  Therefore I get greatly bothered by her never putting even an ounce of effort in to starting it off, not even making out.  I have *every single time* for almost 2 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Girlfriend has never instigated sex in almost 2 years, despite being comfortable with it.  I've brought it up multiple times, but nothing changes.  I'm bothered by this and don't know what to do.

---

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're putting way too much pressure on sex being the most important way to show someone you care. It's not the only way, and it's not even the most important way for many people. Maybe try having a conversation with her about what makes her feel loved and appreciated, and see if there are other ways you can show her that you care."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for women to not initiate sex, especially if they're not feeling it. Maybe try asking her what's going on and why she's not feeling like initiating sex. It could be something as simple as she's not feeling well or she's stressed about something else. Don't assume it's because she doesn't care about you."
* "I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Sex is not the only way to show someone you care. Maybe try focusing on other ways to connect with her, like having meaningful conversations or doing things she enjoys. You might find that you're more fulfilled in the relationship and that sex becomes less of an issue."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for women to feel pressure to initiate sex, especially if their partner is not initiating it. Maybe try taking the pressure off and just being present with each other. You might find that sex becomes more natural and enjoyable when you're not putting so much pressure on it."
* "I think you need to have a conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on and why she's not initiating sex. It's possible that there's something going on that you're not aware of, and it's important to communicate openly and honestly with each other. Don't assume that she's not initiating sex because she doesn't care about you, because that's not necessarily true."

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [24F] for ten years broke-up six months ago; now I feel angry to myself and can't talk to people

POST: Hi.

When I was in fifth grade, at 2005, a beautiful girl asked me to be her friend; and we were together until six months ago, that's around 9-10 years. I can't remember the times I wasn't with her. I don't have a memory which doesn't include her.

I was never comfortable around people, and only with her I was relaxed, I could talk comfortably only with her, and we always said that we won't leave each ever. I was very happy.

And things start to get bad. I couldn't met her expectations. She got depressed, and I couldn't help her; I couldn't find correct words to say to her, and I couldn't make her happy. After the treatment for her depression, she (correctly) left me, and blocked me everywhere except one messaging service.

After that, I was just making myself believe that she'll be back, we'll be together and happy again. But she clearly isn't. Recently she told me that she's with someone else, he loves her very much etc. 

And there's me now. My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.

She isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.

Actually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.

Have a nice day everyone.

TL;DR: I was with my girlfriend for 10 years, we broke up 6 months ago, and I'm struggling to cope with the loss. I feel angry and numb, and I don't know how to move on. I'm seeking advice and support.

REPLIES:

1. **OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you had a deep and meaningful relationship with your girlfriend, and it's natural that you're struggling to adjust to life without her.**

2. **I think it's amazing that you're taking the first step to talk about your feelings. That takes a lot of courage.**

3. **It's okay to feel angry, and it's okay to feel numb. Those are valid emotions. What's important is that you're acknowledging them and taking small steps towards healing.**

4. **I think it's great that you're focusing on your job and education. That's a great way to keep yourself occupied and give yourself a sense of purpose.**

5. **Remember that you don't have to do this alone. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies.**

6. **It's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. You don't have to rush into anything or try to fill the void with someone else. Just focus on healing and becoming the best version of yourself.**

7. **I hope you find some comfort in knowing that you're not alone in this. Many people have gone through similar experiences and have come out stronger on the other side.**

8. **Remember that your worth and identity are not defined by your relationship with your girlfriend. You are a unique and valuable person, and you deserve to be happy and fulfilled.**

9. **It's okay to feel lost and unsure of what the future holds. But try to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time. You got this!**

10. **Keep in mind that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend that everything is fine when it's not. You're strong and capable, and you can get through this.**



The OP (original poster) is sharing his story of a 10-year relationship that ended six months ago. He's struggling to cope with the loss and is feeling angry and numb. The community is offering support and advice, reminding him that it's okay to feel these emotions and that he's not alone. They're encouraging him to focus on himself, take small steps towards healing, and consider seeking professional help if needed. The comments are filled with empathy, understanding, and a sense of community, which can be a powerful tool in the healing process.

TITLE: TIFU by having my friend change one word in a document

POST: So since it's hack your school network week I figured I'd make my first post this. This happened last year and there is a little backstory. My school has a gaming club and they download computer games (illegally) and put them on a folder in the commons folder on our schools network. So any ways me and my friend would always go to his moms room (she is a computer teacher and has a bunch of computers and let's us on our phones and shit). We on occasion would play games from the gaming club folder  until one day all the games were deleted because they were pirated but they left a note saying why they were deleted. Here is the FU.anybody is able to edit the document so I tell my friend "hey you should change one word."(badass right). He agreed to do it and changed. 2 days later the gaming club lady is at his moms room pissed off. When he changed the word it apparently said he created the document. Anyways she had our IT guys inspect every computer to see what actually happens and then proceeds to tell us "this is what happens to my gaming club when kids decide to hack the school server". needless my friends mom was really pissed when we told her what actually happens

TL;DR: I told my friend to change one word in a document, he changed the creator to himself, and now the gaming club lady is mad and our IT guys are investigating.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a story about how they and their friend tried to hack the school network, but ended up causing more problems than they anticipated. The post is relatable, entertaining, and provides a good laugh.

The story starts with the OP explaining the backstory of the gaming club and how they would play games on the school network. They then mention that the games were deleted because they were pirated, and a note was left explaining why. The OP then shares how they and their friend tried to hack the document, and how it ended up causing more problems than they anticipated.

The post is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and a good use of humor. The OP uses a conversational tone, which makes the post feel more like a story being told than a formal report. The use of colloquial language and slang (e.g. "badass right", "shit") adds to the post's humor and makes it feel more relatable.

Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story, and it's a good reminder to always think carefully before taking action, especially when it comes to technology. It's also a good reminder to always be careful when sharing personal stories online, as they can be easily misinterpreted or misunderstood.

TITLE: Redditors, have you ever thought of a genius invention on your own, that later in life you found out made someone else rich?

POST: Hi reddit, I'm 19 and I currently go to Virginia Tech University in the U.S. Ever since I was little i would always come up with inventions in my mind that I didn't have the ability to make myself and would never share for no particular reason with people that could. One that I remember, that recently I found out had been invented was a machine that would tell people how many parking spaces were available and where those parking spaces were in a parking garage. I'd always hate going to the mall with my family and being stuck searching floor after floor of the garage for a spot, and thought that what if someone could create a small sensor like an invisible laser that you could install over every parking space to signal whether a car was under it or not, if the space was free it would light up and direct cars to it. This was 5 or 6 years ago when I was in middle school. The first time i saw one of those boards that tell you if a garage was full I thought to myself, wow that could've been my idea that got me rich, if only I capatilized on the thought. Yesterday as I was parking my car I noticed green lights over spaces that were free and red lights over spaces that weren't...someone had invented what I thought of years ago and put it into reality. Of course someone else deserves the money for the hard work, it just sucks to think that could've been me. Any of you have any similar stories to share?

TL;DR: OP had an idea for a parking space sensor system in middle school, and recently saw it in action at a parking garage. They're wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience where they came up with an idea that was later made into a successful invention by someone else.

TITLE: Redditors, what's the most creative or innovative thing you've ever done in your life?

POST: Hi fellow Redditors, I'm 25 and I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of things in my life that I'm proud of, but there's one thing that stands out to me as the most creative and innovative thing I've ever done. When I was 18, I decided to build a treehouse in my backyard. It wasn't just any treehouse, though - it was a fully functional, multi-story treehouse with a rope bridge, a secret passageway, and even a working elevator. I spent months designing and building it, and it was an incredible experience. I learned so much about carpentry, engineering, and problem-solving, and it was an amazing feeling to see my vision come to life. The best part was that it became a gathering place for my friends and family, and we would have the best times up there, having picnics, playing games, and just enjoying each other's company. I've always been proud of what I accomplished, and I think it's a great example of what can happen when you combine creativity, innovation, and hard work. So, Redditors, what's the most creative or innovative thing you've ever done in your life? I'd love to hear your stories!

TITLE: Redditors, what's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done in your life?

POST: Hey fellow Redditors, I'm 28 and I've done some pretty crazy things in my life, but there's one thing that stands out to me as the most ridiculous. When I was 22, I decided to try to break the world record for most hamburgers eaten in one sitting. I spent weeks training my stomach, eating massive amounts of food and drinking gallons of water to prepare. On the day of the attempt, I showed up at the local diner and started chomping down on those bad boys. I ended up eating 21 hamburgers in 30 minutes, which was a new record at the time. It was an incredible feeling, but also a really stupid one. I ended up getting food poisoning and had to spend the next 3 days in bed, feeling like I was going to die. It was definitely a ridiculous thing to do, but it's a great story to tell and it's a reminder that sometimes you just have to take risks and be a little crazy. So, Redditors, what's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done in your life? I'd love to hear your stories!

POST: Hey fellow Redditors, I'm 29 and I've always been a bit of a planner. I like to have a schedule and stick to it, but there was one time when I did something completely spontaneous and it ended up being one of the best experiences of my life. It was a few years ago, and I was on a road trip with some friends. We were driving through the mountains, and we saw a sign that said "Hot Springs - 10 miles". We decided to take a detour and check it out, and it ended up being this amazing natural hot spring in the middle of nowhere. We spent hours soaking in the water, relaxing and enjoying each other's company. It was such a great experience, and it was all because we decided to take a chance and go off the beaten path.

TITLE: Girlfriend and her ex.

POST: Hi,
Throwaway account. I'm M/22. I was with my girlfriend for about a year then we split because she went travelling. We are now back together and met up overseas and travelled for a few weeks then she has a few weeks travelling by herself before she returns home.

I have noticed she keeps in touch with her ex-boyfriends, one in particular, who she has told me a bit about but overall been very closed about it. She is going to his country visit. All she has told me is that she is staying with a "friend" there who she met when she lived there. I'm about 90% sure it's him.

My issue is not that I mind her seeing an ex boyfriend, it's that she is not open about it and still doesn't tell me when I ask her who she is staying with. 

What is the best way to bring up the fact that this makes me uncomfortable? I am going to try to address this on skype.
I've tried not to blather on too much but ask if I have forgotten any important details.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is going to visit an ex-boyfriend in his country, not telling me who she is staying with, making me uncomfortable.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your girlfriend is still not fully committed to your relationship. She's not being open with you about her plans, and it's understandable that it makes you uncomfortable. You should have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you feel. Let her know that you value transparency and honesty in your relationship, and that her secrecy is causing you to feel uncertain and insecure. It's possible that she's not even aware of the impact her actions are having on you, so it's important to communicate your feelings clearly and respectfully."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's not about being jealous or possessive, it's about feeling left out and unsure of what's going on. You should express your concerns to your girlfriend and ask her why she's not being open with you. It's possible that she's not thinking about the impact her actions are having on you, or that she's not aware of how her secrecy is making you feel. Try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her, and see if you can come to a understanding. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
3. **NotMyProblem**: "I don't think it's a big deal. She's an adult, she can do what she wants. If you're really that uncomfortable, maybe you should reevaluate whether this relationship is right for you. It's not like she's cheating on you or anything. Just chill out and focus on your own life."
4. **ConcernedFriend**: "I think you should be honest with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's not about being jealous or possessive, it's about feeling left out and unsure of what's going on. You should express your concerns to her and ask her why she's not being open with you. It's possible that she's not thinking about the impact her actions are having on you, or that she's not aware of how her secrecy is making you feel. Try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her, and see if you can come to a understanding. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
5. **Experienced**: "I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's not about being jealous or possessive. It's about feeling left out and unsure of what's going on. You should express your concerns to your girlfriend and ask her why she's not being open with you. It's possible that she's not thinking about the impact her actions are having on you, or that she's not aware of how her secrecy is making you feel. Try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her, and see if you can come to a understanding. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."---

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are generally supportive and encouraging, with many users advising the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings.

TITLE: 3 weeks later, my boss still hasn't given me a contract to sign. WTF should I do?

POST: This is a post that first started here:

I like my new job, it's with a respected firm led by a well-regarded local professor... but it's been three weeks and I still don't have a hiring contract to sign. I'm not sure what to do. He asked for all other hiring documentation (I9s, proof of insurance, voided check, etc.) but hasn't gotten a proper hiring contract for me to sign. He's been "editing it" since last week. I wrote to him in an informal email that the end of the week (today) is my personal deadline to complete paperwork, and it's almost 11 (Half day) and I don't have anything. I'm confused and hurt - this is not how you treat people, especially build trust with new employees. He's really well-respected, and this could be a lucrative post-graduate career should I stay, but how can I (and him) respect myself if I do without a contract for much longer? 

I plan to send an email saying that I've enjoyed the work thus far and am available next week as planned pending the receipt of a contract to sign, etc. Is this too demanding for a newbie? Am I a pushover? 
WTF do I do and still hold my head high, here at work and in general?
Also, if I send that email, will it fuck up our relationship as mentor-mentee?

TL;DR: 3 weeks in, no contract to sign, boss "editing" it, personal deadline today, unsure what to do. Should I send an email stating my concerns and availability pending contract receipt?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I would send the email you're planning to send. It's reasonable to expect a contract after 3 weeks. You're not being demanding, you're being professional. If your boss has an issue with it, that's a red flag."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "Hey there! It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure about what to do. I'd suggest sending that email you're planning to send. It's a clear and respectful way to communicate your concerns. If your boss is still 'editing' the contract after 3 weeks, it's reasonable to wonder if they're stalling or if there's an issue. You deserve a contract to sign before committing to the job. Remember, you're not being pushy, you're being assertive."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I'd say send the email, but also consider having a conversation with your boss in person. Sometimes, emails can come across as formal or impersonal. Having a conversation can help clear the air and show that you're willing to work together to find a solution."
4. **u/another_random_user**: "I'm a bit surprised that your boss hasn't given you a contract yet. That's not normal. I'd send the email and also consider talking to HR or someone else in the company to see if they can help facilitate the process. You deserve a contract, and it's not fair to expect you to start working without one."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "Also, don't forget that you can always negotiate the terms of the contract if you're not happy with something. It's not uncommon for new employees to have some clauses changed or added. Just make sure you're clear about what you're comfortable with and what you're not."

**Conclusion:**

The post received a lot of support and advice from the community. Many users agreed that sending the email was a reasonable and professional way to communicate concerns. Some users also suggested having a conversation with the boss in person to clear the air and show willingness to work together. The community also emphasized the importance of having a contract and not being pushed around by a boss who is not respecting the employee's needs. Overall, the post received a lot of helpful and supportive comments that helped the OP feel less alone and more empowered to take action.

TITLE: How do I respond to people I work with asking how old I am? (26f)

POST: I started college when I was 17 and knew what I wanted to do right off the bat, so at this point I've been in my field for nearly a decade (I had a job in college in my field). I also got married at 19 and had my first child at 20, and I'm very good at my job (I'm a graphic designer/marketer) so I am in a position in life that is usually normal for someone about five or more years older than I am.

I feel capable at my job and in my element running meetings with men twice my age, but every once in awhile someone I work with in some capacity will ask me how old I am. Frankly, I don't want to tell people, I'd rather it be ambiguous. I've noticed a marked difference in the way people respond to me once they have confirmed that yes, I'm younger than they think I am and don't just have a fantastic skin care regimen. How do I respond? Do I lie? Do I just live with it? Is there any professional way at all to respond to that question without saying 'none of your business'?

TL;DR: I'm 26, but people at work keep asking me how old I am and it makes me uncomfortable. How do I respond without lying or saying it's none of their business?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, I think it's okay to just say 'I'd rather not share that' or 'it's not relevant to our conversation.' You don't owe anyone an explanation, and it's not like it's a requirement for doing your job. Just be firm but polite, and I think people will respect your boundaries."
* "I've been in similar situations and I've found that saying 'I'm focusing on my work, not my age' usually does the trick. It's a way of redirecting the conversation back to what matters, which is your skills and abilities as a professional."
* "I'm a bit older than you, but I've had people ask me how old I am too. I usually just laugh it off and say 'I'm old enough to know better, but young enough to not give a damn.' It's a lighthearted way to deflect the question and show that you're not bothered by it."
* "I think it's okay to be honest, but also to frame it in a way that makes it clear you're not trying to hide anything. For example, you could say 'I'm 26, but I've been in the industry for a while and I've worked hard to get where I am. I think my experience and skills are what matter most, not my age.' This way, you're still sharing your age, but you're also emphasizing your qualifications and accomplishments."
* "I've found that people who ask about your age are usually doing it out of curiosity or to try to put you in a certain box. If you don't give them the answer they're looking for, they'll often move on to something else. So, I think it's okay to just smile and say 'I'm happy to focus on my work, not my age.' It's a way of asserting your professionalism and confidence, and it usually does the trick."

This post and its comments provide a range of responses to the question of how to handle people asking about one's age at work. Some commenters suggest being direct and firm, while others recommend framing the answer in a way that emphasizes one's skills and qualifications. The post itself expresses a desire to avoid sharing one's age, but also acknowledges that honesty may be the best policy. Overall, the conversation is focused on finding a way to respond to the question that is professional, confident, and assertive.

TITLE: ELI5 Why is it some people get assignment done in no time and others take forever?

POST: I always considered myself pretty average when it comes to assignment (you know like 5 page long essays) I really never had any motivation, but I can tell you for sure, and this holds true even at university: It takes me 1h per page, search / planning included. 

If I have a 5 page essay, it will take me 5 to 7h (depending if I take breaks)

Today, I did 3 assignments of 4 pages in 14hours, two of which I had to research sources. 

I really don't mean to brag and this kind of "ability?" always made my work feel worthless, as I feel like I'm putting no effort in it.

When speaking to classmates, they planned 3 days for 1 of the assignment, now I do proclaim the same thing to my family, but truth is the 3 days would be spent playing video games and what not, and the actual work will pretty much always be done day before due.

TL;DR: I can do 5 page essays in 5-7h, while others take 3 days. Why is that?

**ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**

Hey there, little buddy! So, you're wondering why some people can finish their homework really fast, while others take a lot longer? Well, let me tell you a secret: it's not just about how smart you are or how much time you have. It's about how you work and how you think!

Imagine you're building a Lego castle. Some people might start by building the whole castle first, then add the details. Others might start with the details, like the windows and doors, and then build the castle around them. Both ways can work, but they take different amounts of time and effort.

When it comes to homework, some people might be "castle builders." They like to plan everything out, research a lot, and then write their essay in one go. This can take a lot of time, but it's like building the whole castle first. Others might be "detail builders." They like to start with the main ideas, write a little bit, and then add more details as they go along. This can also work, but it might take less time overall.

Another thing that can affect how fast someone does their homework is their "work style." Some people might be "sprinters." They like to work really fast and get everything done quickly. Others might be "marathon runners." They like to work steadily and take breaks along the way. Both styles can be effective, but they require different approaches.

So, why do some people finish their homework really fast, while others take a lot longer? It's because they have different ways of working and thinking. Some people might be more organized, while others might be more spontaneous. Some people might be better at planning, while others might be better at improvising.

The most important thing is to find what works best for you and stick to it. Whether you're a "castle builder" or a "detail builder," whether you're a "sprinter" or a "marathon runner," the key is to find a way that makes you feel happy and confident. And remember, it's okay to take your time and ask for help if you need it!

TITLE: Reddit, I met my soul mate and was so in awe with him.. until I found out he dropped out of community college and has been a full-time cashier ever since. I'm a doctor who makes six digits.

POST: We talked for hours and shared our interests, many of which we share. I became so infatuated with everything about him.. he is literally a male version of me. Then I found out he dropped out of community college and has been working as a cashier at a convenience store ever since.

Reddit, is it wrong that I suddenly became unattracted to him? Comparably, I have a high-paying job and I feel like taking this relationship any further, and even possibly to marriage, just couldn't work out. I feel *terrible* but does anyone understand my situation that can offer advice on what I should do? Am I wrong to think about it from a logical point of view, rather than a "this could be my soul mate" point?

TL;DR: Met someone who shares my interests, but found out he dropped out of community college and has been working as a cashier. I'm a doctor with a high-paying job and feel like our lifestyles are too different. Should I continue the relationship or not?

COMMENT 1:
"Ah, the classic 'I'm a high-achiever and I expect my partner to be just as high-achieving' complex. Newsflash: people come from different backgrounds and have different goals. Maybe he's happy being a cashier and doesn't want to pursue higher education. Maybe he's not interested in being a doctor. Maybe he's just a nice guy who likes you for who you are, not for your job title. You're not wrong to think about it logically, but maybe you should also consider the possibility that he's not defined by his job or education level. Give him a chance to prove himself to you beyond his career."

COMMENT 2:
"I'm a doctor too, and I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed in your reaction. You're a doctor, for crying out loud! You should know better than to judge someone based on their job or education level. What about his personality, values, and goals? Are those not important to you? It sounds like you're more interested in his bank account than his character. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating your priorities. Maybe you're not as compatible as you think you are."

COMMENT 3:
"I'm not a doctor, but I do work in a high-stress job and I've been in relationships with people from different backgrounds. I think it's great that you're considering the practicalities of the relationship, but don't dismiss him entirely just yet. Maybe you could have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and see how he responds. Maybe he's been holding back because he's afraid of your reaction. Maybe he's willing to work together to find a solution. Don't give up on him just yet."

COMMENT 4:
"I'm a cashier, and I have to say, I'm a bit offended by your post. Just because someone works in a 'lower' paying job doesn't mean they're any less worthy of love or respect. Maybe he's happy with his job and doesn't want to pursue higher education. Maybe he's just not interested in being a doctor. Maybe he's a great guy who loves you for who you are, not for your job title. You're not wrong to think about it logically, but maybe you should also consider the possibility that he's not defined by his job or education level. Give him a chance to prove himself to you beyond his career."

COMMENT 5:
"I'm a doctor too, and I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by your reaction. You're a doctor, for crying out loud! You should know better than to judge someone based on their job or education level. What about his personality, values, and goals? Are those not important to you? It sounds like you're more interested in his bank account than his character. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating your priorities. Maybe you're not as compatible as you think you are." (This comment is identical to COMMENT 2, but with a different username)

Reddit users are divided on whether the OP is justified in being unattracted to their partner due to their job and education level. Some users argue that it's unfair to judge someone based on their job or education level, and that there are more important factors to consider in a relationship. Others argue that the OP has a right to consider the practicalities of the relationship and that their partner's job and education level may not be compatible with their own. The discussion highlights the complexities of relationships and the importance of considering multiple factors when evaluating compatibility.

TITLE: I [M 18] just found a girl [F 18] whom I've only met a few times on FB recently-after two years of not talking.

POST: So the first time I met this girl about 2 years go at church- I felt an instant connection with her. I finally found her on Facebook and we've been talking. She's ok with hanging out-and I dont think I'm in the friend-zone because she's so open to go out. But she just posted a relationship update to make it "Facebook" official. What would be a good plan? We're getting together in a little over a month to shop around at a record store, a hippie shop, etc. I just feel like even though I don't know her that well it was like a spiritual and emotional connection. But she's in a relationship which I assume is serious. Should I assert my feelings for her when we meet up? I'm not sure what to do-in my mind she's life partner/wife material because she seems perfect for me. At this point in y life I really don't want a girlfriend or children but she makes me think otherwise.

TL;DR: I met a girl 2 years ago at church, we reconnected on FB, and she just made her relationship official on Facebook. I feel a strong connection with her, but she's in a serious relationship. Should I assert my feelings for her when we meet up?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 18. Take a step back and reevaluate your priorities. You don't want to get into a situation where you're trying to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. It's not fair to her or you. Just enjoy the friendship and see where it goes."
* "I understand the connection, but you need to respect her relationship. If you're feeling this strongly, maybe you should take some time to reflect on why you're so drawn to her. Is it because of who she is as a person or because of the idea of being with her? You might find that you're not ready for a serious relationship like this."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. But be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. You need to respect her relationship and her boundaries. If she's not interested, it's okay to move on and focus on your own personal growth."
* "I'm not sure what to say, but I think you should take a step back and focus on yourself. You're 18, you're young, and you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't get caught up in the idea of being with someone who's already taken. You deserve someone who's all yours."
* "I think you should try to talk to her about how you're feeling, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. You need to respect her relationship and her boundaries. If she's not interested, it's okay to move on and focus on your own personal growth."



**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are generally advising the OP to take a step back and reevaluate his priorities. Many commenters are suggesting that he should focus on himself and his own personal growth rather than pursuing someone who's already in a relationship. Others are advising him to have an open and honest conversation with the girl about how he's feeling, but also to be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. Overall, the comments are encouraging the OP to prioritize his own well-being and to be respectful of the girl's relationship and boundaries.

TITLE: Reddit, who is the most important person in your life, and why?

POST: Mine is simple, my kids. I will always remember the one day my daughter made me feel like the best dad in the world. I sometimes have to go back to work late at night to attend meetings (I work for a place with offices around the world) and one day I was home before my family was done with school. I decided to make some dinner and leave it for them and while I was making it I spotted some cookie dough in the fridge. I thought it would be nice to leave them cookies. So when my wife picks the kids up from daycare she said my daughter seemed to have a rough day (as rough as a 5 year old can have, I guess) and was very grumpy/sad. When they got home my son smelled the curry I had made and got very excited and then my daughter found the cookies. I had left a little note saying to enjoy the cookies and sorry for having to work late. My daughter started to cry and said she was so happy. My wife took a short video and sent it to me at work. I have never felt more needed and counted upon, then that. I know that these kids will cause me all kinds of worry throughout our lives, but I wouldn't trade that feeling of unconditional love for anything.

TL;DR: OP's kids make him feel like the most important person in his life because of the unconditional love they show him.

COMMENTS:

* "That's amazing! I'm sure your kids will always remember that moment and cherish the feeling of being loved and cared for by their dad."
* "I'm getting emotional just reading this. It's amazing how much love and appreciation we can get from our kids, isn't it?"
* "I'm a dad too and I can totally relate to this. There's nothing better than making your kids happy and feeling like you're making a difference in their lives."
* "This is so beautiful. I'm sure your kids will grow up to be amazing people because of the love and support you're giving them."
* "I'm not a dad yet, but this post has made me realize how important it is to be there for your kids and make them feel loved and appreciated. Thanks for sharing this story!"

This post is a heartwarming and relatable story about the importance of family and the unconditional love that children can show towards their parents. The OP's story about making cookies for his kids and receiving a video of their happy reaction is a sweet and touching moment that highlights the joy and fulfillment that comes from being a parent. The comments are also filled with positive and supportive responses, with many people sharing their own experiences and emotions in response to the post. Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of content that can bring people together and make them feel good.

TITLE: My disabled little sister is getting bullied. What advice can I give her?

POST: My little sister is 14 years old and has cerebral palsy. She is functionally fine except for her legs. She's been in a wheel chair most of her life but can walk, albeit not very far, with a frame. My mum is quite overprotective of her and she doesn't go out of the house except for school and the times I take her to the movies or whatnot. 

Her only real friend is a kid named Jordan who she only knows because he is the kid of one of my mums friends. He's a few years younger than her and they don't go to the same school.

I live with my girlfriend and don't see my sister as much as I once did but when I went to visit last weekend she told me she was getting bullied at school. Apparently a lot of the kids have taken to calling her a lesbian and this is upsetting her quite a bit. I asked my mum about it and she said it's been going on for awhile and she's spoken to her teachers about it. But this doesn't seem to have done anything.

We didn't actually discuss whether she was a lesbian or not, apart from the fact that that is just not a conversation I want to have with ANY person that is 11 years my junior, especially not my baby sister it's just not something that really concerns either of us. We've talked about being gay in the past, as our next door neighbors are a gay couple that come over just about every other day, and she is very much of the opinion that it just doesn't matter who you love, as long you're happy.

There wasn't really a lot of advice I could give her outside of "aim for the throat". I too was bullied at school and eventually it stopped because I started to pummel the people doing it, but as you can imagine that's not really something I can tell my sister to do, even if she was actually capable of doing it.

So basically has anyone got any advice I can give to her?

TL;DR: My 14 year old sister with cerebral palsy is getting bullied at school and I'm at a loss for what to say to her. She's being called a lesbian and it's really upsetting her. I don't want to tell her to fight back because that's not a solution and I don't want to tell her to ignore it because that's not going to work either. Any advice would be appreciated.

TITLE: Whats your best "control your fucking kid" moment you have ever seen? Here's mine..

POST: So the people across the street from me have ended up adopting about 5 kids. The youngest one (about 5) constantly runs all around the neighborhood annoying the shit out of everyone. Her parents are never home and she is allowed to do basically what ever she wants (I'm pretty sure she has some metal issues as well). So about an hour ago I hear some sirens and I look out the window to see an ambulance in front of the house down the street. I go outside and stand on the driveway to get a better view and what do I see? The little brat of a kid is running around the EMTs and actually trying to go into the house where they are working. While all of this is happening her parents and older siblings are no where to be found. I really wish they would just move already...

TL;DR: The kid across the street is a handful and her parents are never home, so I got to see an ambulance show up and the kid try to run into the house where the EMTs were working.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "That's insane. I can understand why you're frustrated. It's not fair to the neighbors or the kid herself to have to deal with that kind of chaos."
* "I'm surprised the parents aren't getting in trouble for this. It's not like the kid is just being a normal kid, she's being a handful and causing problems for others."
* "I feel for the kid, though. She's probably just acting out because she's not getting the attention she needs. Maybe the parents should take a closer look at their parenting style."
* "I'm not saying the kid is innocent, but it's not like she's the only one who's ever acted out. We've all been there at some point. Maybe the parents should try to find ways to channel her energy in a positive way."
* "I'm with you on this one. If the parents can't even be bothered to keep an eye on their kid, they shouldn't have that many kids. It's not fair to the kid or the neighbors."

This post is an example of a "control your fucking kid" moment, where the author is frustrated with the behavior of a child and feels that the parents are not doing enough to control or discipline the child. The post is also an example of a "neighborhood drama" post, where the author is sharing a story about a situation that is affecting their daily life and is seeking validation and support from the community. The post is likely to generate a lot of comments and responses from other Redditors who have had similar experiences or have strong opinions on the topic.

TITLE: Any got a snappy, subtle comeback for a juvenile and jealous fellow suitor? (in text?)

POST: So this girl I know was in a picture with me in one of those poses, you know, where one of you is holding the camera at arms length? It got posted on facebook, real cute. Anyway, another guy we both know who is younger than us by 4 years has a massive crush on her. He spends way more time with her than I do, because I work a lot, and it's pretty obvious to everyone.

Thing is, though, this girl is real flirty to other guys, particularly me, partly because I'm the next-most present person, but also because I'm just swell. He doesn't like it. And as the immature bozo he is, he takes potshots at me occasionally (in words of course) especially when the flirting is afoot. Now, I'm not one to bother getting into it with him (he's like 6'5'') because that will surely get me nowhere.

That was my position on it UNTIL he commented on the photo. In it, we happen to be dressed as avatars for a halloween party, and it just so happens that I have reddish long hair so I just braided it rather than get a black wig. I commented in the pic that I look crazy. Well this wise guy, who was also at the party as an avatar painted blue, decides to comment on it with, "you're covered in blue makeup and have your hair braided like a kindergarten school girl... I think your crazy is more internal than aesthetic."

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I thought he was a friendly dude I'd laugh it off, agree and all. But no. Now it's posted on facebook for the internets to see it. LAME NO THX. So I feel the need to post a snappy but subtle comeback. AND YOU CAN HELP!

TL;DR: Jealous suitor takes potshots at me, comments on a photo saying I'm crazy, and I need a snappy comeback. Help!

TITLE: TIFU by having a shitty morning and going to McDonald's

POST: About two days ago actually I had a really shitty morning.

Firstly my alarm does not go off. So I didn't have breakfast. Rush to the train station and I miss my train by 15 seconds.

So, minding my own business as I finally make it to my campus I decide to hit up McDonald's (their hash browns are really nice in Australia).
So as I'm walking down campus to get breakfast I hear a whirling sound. Wheels. Roller blades?

I turn my head around and for about half a second I spot a little girl maybe 4 or 5 years old on a scooter. Then suddenly everything stops and I hear a sickening bang. I didn't feel anything so I thought I imagined it but sure enough she had fallen over, her little razor scooter tipped over with her.

I freak out and ask her if she's okay, if she's bleeding, if her parents are nearby. On the inside I was swearing like a sailor.

Luckily her dad was not too far behind, along with the girl's little sister. She wasn't hurt, there was no bleeding and by the end of it they're all consoling me instead.

TL;DR: I had a crappy morning, missed my train, and then I accidentally caused a little girl to fall off her scooter. I'm still shaken.

TITLE: [28/F] Trying to be classy. And date several guys at once.

POST: I recently got out of a long term relationship and am sick of being a serial monogamist. My goal for right now is to go out on actual dates (dinner, drinks, coffee) with different men, and go out on several dates and get to know them as people, and then selectively get physical with them if it feels right. Its working pretty well: I've made it clear to them that I am in no way ready for a commitment and they've each acknowledged that.

Except I finally slept with one. And he's very into me. And texts me all the time. I hate texting in general and frequently don't return texts.  (I have told him that I suck at texting but still texts me all the time). Now I'm feeling like I'm going to break his heart, even though expectations were on the table. 

Do I (1) need an attitude adjustment because I've been clear about my expectations with each person or (2) am I playing with fire and potentially being irresponsible by engaging with people in a romantic context and then only responding to their texts/calls when it suits me? (I'm also a genuinely busy person).

I am open to general advice as well on actual dating and balancing sex and communication. (The only person I know who went on a lot of actual dates is my very old/old fashioned grandmother, and she definitely could not relate to a Tinder world.)

TL;DR: I'm trying to date multiple guys at once, but one of them is getting too attached and I don't know how to handle it.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're playing with fire. You've been clear about your expectations, but it's not fair to lead someone on and then ignore their texts/calls. If you're not interested in pursuing something serious with this guy, it's better to be upfront and kind about it. You can't just use someone for a good time and then ghost them."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit unfair to yourself. You've been clear about your expectations, and he's still choosing to pursue you. That's on him, not you. If he can't handle the fact that you're not interested in a serious relationship, then maybe he's not the right guy for you. As for the texting, maybe try to be more considerate and respond to his texts in a timely manner. It's not about being 'classy' or 'busy', it's about being respectful."
3. **dating_expert**: "I think you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. You want to date multiple guys, but you also want to be exclusive with one of them. It's not sustainable or fair to either party. You need to decide what you want and be honest with yourself and others. If you're not ready for a serious relationship, then maybe you should focus on casual hookups or friendships instead of trying to date multiple guys."
4. **honest_hannah**: "I think you're being a bit selfish. You're using these guys for a good time and then ignoring them when you're done. That's not okay. If you're not interested in pursuing something serious with someone, then it's better to be upfront and kind about it. You can't just use people for your own entertainment and then discard them when you're done."
5. **classy_caroline**: "I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. You've been clear about your expectations, and he's still choosing to pursue you. That's on him, not you. As for the texting, maybe try to be more considerate and respond to his texts in a timely manner. It's not about being 'classy' or 'busy', it's about being respectful. And if he can't handle the fact that you're not interested in a serious relationship, then maybe he's not the right guy for you."

TITLE: [31 F] with friend [24 F] want her happy but don't want to lead her on

POST: We've seen each other around, but only recently are we friends.  Yes, there's attraction there (she's lesbian, I'm non-cis). 
I'm in a long term committed relationship (friend is aware).
She's in a 2 yr committed relationship.
Her girlfriend treats her poorly. She's aware of it.  She's unhappy.

I'm a supportive person, and even the most basic nice things you say to friends (you look nice! thanks for the delicious dinner! It's cool you like "x") is shocking to her. 

I want her to find someone who treats her right.  Treats her how she deserves.  It's too early for me to butt in specifically. But I want to drop hints that she deserves better, without implying that I am that something better.

What makes it so difficult is that if I had met her earlier in my life this wouldn't even be a debate.

Any Ideas?

TL;DR: Friend in unhappy relationship, I'm in a committed relationship, I want her to find someone who treats her right, but don't want to lead her on.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're already doing a great job by being a supportive friend. You're not leading her on, you're just being a good listener and showing her kindness. That's all anyone can ask for. Don't worry too much about it, just keep being your awesome self"
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're overthinking this. You're not in a position to 'find her someone better' or 'be that something better'. Your role is to be a supportive friend. If she's unhappy in her relationship, that's not your problem to fix. Just be there for her and let her know you care. The rest will take care of itself"
3. **u/lesbianpower**: "As a lesbian, I have to say that it's refreshing to see someone who is genuinely supportive of their friend's happiness, regardless of their own relationship status. You're not leading her on, you're just being a good friend. Keep being you and let her know that you're there for her, no matter what"
4. **u/awkward_situation**: "I think you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Be honest with her, but also be respectful of her relationship. Let her know that you care about her and want her to be happy, but that you're not in a position to be anything more than friends. That way, she knows where you stand and can make her own decisions"
5. **u/relationship_expert**: "I think you're doing the right thing by not trying to 'fix' her relationship or find her someone better. That's not your role. Instead, focus on being a supportive friend and let her know that you're there for her, no matter what. If she's unhappy in her relationship, that's a sign that she needs to re-evaluate her priorities and make some changes. You can't force someone to leave a bad relationship, but you can be there to support her when she's ready to make a change"

TITLE: I just noticed I don't have full access to my boyfriend's facebook profile. Should I be concerned?

POST: I'm pretty sure this is a stupid thing to be concerned about in the grand scheme of things, but I could use some input.

I was looking for one of his friends who got married recently (couldn't remember her amended last name, but I knew they were facebook friends) so I went to his profile to check his friends and locate her. But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. 

Now, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them. 

The thing is, I don't think I'm an overly clingy girlfriend (and he has said numerous times that I'm not). I don't try to control every aspect of his life. So I'm not sure why I no longer have full access. 

I'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.

Is it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide? I'm not going to fly off the handle; it's just that his track record has been such that this could be nothing, or it could be SUPER HUGE, and I won't know until it's too late.

TL;DR: Boyfriend's Facebook profile won't let me see his friends list. Is it normal for him to have privacy filters set? Should I ask him about it? Is it possible he has something to hide?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "Honestly, it's probably just an oversight. People forget to update their privacy settings all the time. If you're really concerned, you could try asking him about it in a non-accusatory way. Like, 'Hey, I noticed I couldn't see your friends list on Facebook. Is there a reason for that?'"
2. "I think you're overthinking this. It's probably just a mistake. But if you're really worried, you could try asking him about it. Just don't make it a big deal or accuse him of hiding something. That could lead to defensiveness and make things worse."
3. "I'm a bit surprised you're concerned about this. If he's really hiding something, it's probably not something you need to know. But if you're really curious, you could try asking him about it. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not want to talk about it."
4. "I think you're being a bit paranoid. It's probably just an oversight. But if you're really concerned, you could try asking him about it. Just don't make it a big deal or accuse him of hiding something. That could lead to defensiveness and make things worse."
5. "I think you should just talk to him about it. Ask him if it was an oversight or if there's a reason for it. And if he says it's an oversight, just drop it. If he says there's a reason, try to understand where he's coming from. Communication is key in any relationship."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit's overall sentiment is that the OP is overthinking the situation and that it's probably just an oversight. Many users suggest asking the boyfriend about it in a non-accusatory way, but also caution against making a big deal out of it or accusing him of hiding something. The subreddit's tone is generally supportive and encouraging of open communication in relationships.

TITLE: TIFU by taking my ex out for dinner

POST: Ok. So like many posts this FU was not today, but back in December. 

BACKSTORY: I had dated this girl freshman year of Highschool. Things were good, but I broke up with her out of peer pressure. I was a self conscious Freshman with little self esteem. I regretted it for years, and the fact we ended up being FWB a couple times did not help. 

So we both get through our first semester of college, myself at a school in Tx, her in Ok. Didn't see each other often, but we did snapchat back and forth once and a while. Well over break she says she is tired of being single, her ex was shitty, blah blah blah. I offer to take her out.

We both dress up, and I took her to this little seafood restaurant, and go see a movie after. The movie I wanted to see so that wasn't really a problem. But I paid for all of it. Every dime.

Throughout the course of the evening all the repressed feelings I had resurfaced, we kissed, it was a bomb time. 

At the end she asks me to drive her to her ex's place. Are you kidding me?!? Which then she calls me right after break to tell me she's dating him again. 

So cool, now I have this slight feeling of desire, mixed with the burning hatred from being screwed.

TL;DR: Took my ex out for dinner, had a great time, and then she went back to her ex. 

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't take your ex out for dinner, unless you're prepared to relive all the feelings you thought you'd left behind.

**Comments:**

* "TIFU by thinking you could just take your ex out for dinner and not have any feelings resurface"

TITLE: I [17 M] just read a comment that makes me feel quite hopeless.. /r/relationships, is it true that it's always the same experience you have with someone you like?

POST: >Those who have dated a lot (and the people who made Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) will tell you that you end up desiring the same type of person over and over again. It's the same restaurants, the same conversations, the same jokes, the same view of familiar places, the same stories of your childhood told to a slightly different person with slightly different looks and habits. A slightly obscure author said, "I like young girls. Their stories are shorter."

Is this true? Because it makes me lose all hope of ever having a meaningful relationship with anyone if all I'm ever gonna find in someone else is just some lesser version of [this](

Hell, I got depressed watching Her because the main character seemed to be doing and saying things almost exactly the same as I did. So if she (a girl I liked ) is all that  I'm gonna see in someone else, then what's the point in any of this?

TL;DR: I read a comment that says you always end up with the same type of person, and it makes me feel hopeless about ever having a meaningful relationship.

---

**Response 1:**

Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's scary to think that we might be stuck in a pattern of attracting the same type of person over and over again. But here's the thing: relationships are complex, and people are complex. Just because you might find yourself drawn to similar types of people doesn't mean you're doomed to repeat the same patterns.

Think about it this way: maybe you're not attracted to the same type of person, but rather the same qualities or characteristics that you find appealing. Those qualities might be present in different people, and it's up to you to recognize and appreciate them.

And don't forget that relationships are about growth and evolution, not just about finding someone who checks all the boxes. You can still have a meaningful relationship with someone even if they're not a carbon copy of someone you've dated before.

So, instead of feeling hopeless, try to focus on what you can learn from your experiences and how you can grow as a person. And who knows, you might just find someone who brings new and exciting things to the table.

**Response 2:**

OP, I totally get why you're feeling hopeless. It can be really disheartening to think that we might be stuck in a pattern of attracting the same type of person. But here's the thing: relationships are about connection and growth, not just about finding someone who checks all the boxes.

So, instead of feeling hopeless, try to focus on what you can learn from your experiences and how you can grow as a person. And who knows, you might just find someone who brings new and exciting things to the table.

**Response 3:**

OP, I totally get why you're feeling hopeless. It can be really disheartening to think that we might be stuck in a pattern of attracting the same type of person. But here's the thing: relationships are about connection and growth, not just about finding someone who checks all the boxes.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my [26 F]. Chemistry/kissing problem. Is it just not meant to be?

POST: A girl that I've known for a few years and I began hooking up recently. I'm extremely attracted to her; we have tons in common and just generally get on great and have become very close. However, the kissing is just..awkward. 

We both have different styles and both want to seem to lead. We acknowledged it and tried to work on it. I kissed her my way and she tried to follow suit but we just weren't synching up and couldn't get into a rhythm. She got paranoid then and wouldn't kiss me the way she usually goes about it.

She's pretty much conceded that it's a deal breaker and that we just don't have sexual chemistry. I'm not so sure. Yes, it was awkward but I wanted to work on it and hopefully we'd eventually get there, and I was still turned on during it.

Everything else is perfect apart from this one thing.  I really thought I might have something with this girl.  It's something that's never ever happened either of us before.. kissing just comes naturally right? Or at least you usually adjust to what's happening. Maybe we put too much pressure on fixing it?

Just wondering what peoples thoughts are on this? Are people sometimes just meant to be very good friends? Is it a sign of no sexual chemistry?

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have a great relationship but we're having trouble with kissing. We've tried to work on it but it's still awkward. She thinks it's a deal breaker, but I'm not so sure. What do you guys think?

**Comments:**

* "I think it's a sign of no sexual chemistry. If it's not working out, it's probably not meant to be. You can't force it."
* "I think it's worth having a conversation about what you both want and need. Maybe there's something specific that's causing the awkwardness. Don't give up yet!"
* "I've been in similar situations before and it's usually because one person is more aggressive or dominant in their kissing style. Maybe try compromising and finding a middle ground?"
* "I think it's a sign of no sexual chemistry, but it's also possible that you're just not compatible in that way. It's not the end of the world, though. You can still have a great relationship without the romance."
* "I think it's worth trying to work on it, but also be honest with yourself about whether it's really worth it. If it's causing more stress than joy, maybe it's not meant to be."
* "I've been in a relationship where we had to work on our kissing style and it took some time, but we eventually got there. Don't give up yet!"
* "I think it's a sign of no sexual chemistry, but it's also possible that you're just not comfortable with each other's kissing style. Maybe try some other forms of intimacy to see if that works better for you both."

**Subreddit Insights:**

* The post received 200+ comments, with a mix of opinions on whether the couple should work on their kissing issues or accept that it's not meant to be.
* Many commenters emphasized the importance of communication and compromise in relationships, suggesting that the couple try to find a middle ground or work on their individual kissing styles.
* Some commenters were more skeptical, suggesting that if the kissing is still awkward after trying to work on it, it may be a sign of no sexual chemistry.
* The post also sparked a discussion about the importance of intimacy and romance in relationships, with some commenters sharing their own experiences and opinions on the matter. Overall, the subreddit community provided a supportive and thought-provoking space for the OP to share their concerns and receive feedback.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my [25F] together 5 months and she has issues over FB photos and posts from past relationship.

POST: So this girl and I have been in a pretty serious relationship for the past 5ish months. She is a little older and has a 5 year old girl from a past relationship that I have just fallen in love with. I have always wanted kids and this has given me a taste of what it is like to be a Daddy.

We both love each other very much and the kid and I both love each other as well. I have taken the little girl fishing, to the zoo, on walks with the dog, etc.

My SO and I have lived together about two months and it has been a little rocky because of our situation but in terms of the relationship between us it has been great.

We met each other in detox and I went to rehab for a few months. We talked while I was there and when I got home we got together.

Not too long after we started getting serious and I started getting involved with the kid she started asking a lot of questions about my ex because of things she saw on Facebook. She believes that my ex is still in love with me and that since we were together so long and still has a lot of pictures up of us together, of which I was also guilty. She asked about a couple casual conversations that my ex and I had in the last few months and I told her honestly that it was just casual conversation.

She seems to think the contrary and believes that it is only a matter of time before we end up getting back together. I tell her there is no way in hell I would do that regardless of being in a relationship or not but she is persistent.

She is so afraid I am going to break her and her daughter's hearts.

I don't know what else to say to her at this point. I deleted all our photos, unfriended her, told her to please take hers down.

This has not done anything to persuade my SO otherwise.

I just want a little perspective on what this is all about or what the next possible moves on my part could be.

I really love this woman and her little girl and I dont want to lose them.

TL;DR: My girlfriend has issues with my ex's Facebook photos and posts from our past relationship. She thinks I'll end up with her again and is afraid of getting hurt. I've told her there's no chance of that happening, but she's persistent. I've deleted our photos and unfriended her, but it's not working. I love her and her daughter and don't want to lose them.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like your girlfriend is struggling with trust issues. You've been honest with her about your past and your feelings, but she's still worried. You might want to try having an open and honest conversation with her about her fears and concerns. It's possible that she's feeling insecure about your past relationship and is worried that you'll end up with her ex again."
* "I think it's great that you're trying to be understanding and patient with your girlfriend's concerns. However, it's also important to set boundaries and communicate your own needs and feelings. You might want to tell her that you understand why she's worried, but you're not going to delete your ex's photos or unfriend her. You could also suggest that she try to focus on the present and future of your relationship instead of dwelling on the past."
* "It's possible that your girlfriend is feeling a sense of competition with your ex, even though you've told her there's no chance of getting back together.

TITLE: Small community org trying to get teens involved. ideas?

POST: so this is a little bit of the old "le sigh, how do we get teens to care" and part of it--well, no that's most of it.

I work for a small community organization in Brooklyn, NY and my job is to try to get high school kids involved in our programs and the community (and programs involving them being involved in the community)

aside from making our posters say "come to our super cool program" and making the background a cat, what else can we do that kids could get interested in? I don't just want programs they come to (yes, those too), but I want them to feel empowered and I want it to be more than JUST because of marketing--though I'm happy to take marketing ideas as well, I'd love getting more people to know that we're doing super cool things    

the community is famously homogeneous but I'd like to avoid pandering to stereotypes ideally I'd like to get the entire community involved in something environmental and local (growing cucumbers for pickling for example), helping clean a local place of worship...  

I'm sure others have had lots of experience with things that have worked (or maybe could/could've worked).  
what have you got?

TL;DR: Trying to get high school kids involved in a small community organization in Brooklyn, NY. Looking for ideas to make them feel empowered and engaged, beyond just marketing. Want to focus on environmental and local initiatives.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think you're on the right track by focusing on environmental and local initiatives. Teens are often more interested in making a difference in their own community than in some generic 'help the world' program. Have you considered partnering with local schools to develop a curriculum that incorporates your organization's initiatives? For example, you could work with a science class to develop a project on sustainable gardening or a history class to explore the history of the community and its relationship with the environment."
2. **u/community_activist**: "I've worked with teens on community projects and one thing that's always been a hit is giving them ownership and autonomy. Let them take the lead on a project and make decisions about what they want to do. It's amazing how much more invested they'll be when they feel like they have a stake in the outcome. Also, consider involving them in the planning and decision-making process for your organization's initiatives. It's not just about getting them to participate, but about making them feel like their voices are being heard."
3. **u/environmental_educator**: "I've worked with teens on environmental projects and one thing that's really effective is making it relevant to their own lives. For example, if you're working on a project to clean up a local park, ask them what they think about the park and how it affects their daily lives. Then, ask them to come up with ideas for how to make it a better place. This not only gets them invested in the project, but also helps them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Also, consider involving them in the evaluation process to see what worked and what didn't, and how they can improve it for next time."
4. **u/Marketing_Maven**: "I'm a marketer, not an expert in community organizing, but I think you're on the right track with the environmental and local initiatives. One thing that might be helpful is to create a social media campaign that showcases the impact of your organization's work. Share stories and photos of the teens who are involved, and highlight the positive changes they're making in their community. You could also create a hashtag and encourage teens to share their own stories and photos using it. This can help create a sense of community and ownership among the teens, and also help spread the word about your organization's initiatives."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Focus on environmental and local initiatives that are relevant to the teens' lives
* Give teens ownership and autonomy over projects and decision-making processes
* Make it relevant to their own lives and experiences
* Involve them in the planning, decision-making, and evaluation processes
* Use social media to showcase the impact of their work and create a sense of community and ownership
* Consider partnering with local schools to develop curriculum that incorporates your organization's initiatives.

TITLE: Me [43 M] with my new partner [37F] 3 weeks duration, first time trying to be intimate I had a failure to launch due to psychological block.

POST: So here is my issue. First some background, I am fairly recently divorced (1 year) coming out of a really bad marriage of 15 years. It was a bad breakup with lots of bitterness on both sides, add to that 2 kids who I now don't get to see as often as I would like. I went from that right into a horrible abusive relationship with a much younger woman (24 F) who essentially saw I was incredibly vulnerable and used me for financial gain while filling my head with how I was a really terrible person which is why I ended up divorced and that she didn't know why she stayed with me. The end result was any self esteem I had was ruined but I somehow got addicted to her. 

I finally left that relationship 3 months ago after I just couldn't take it anymore. I really worked to try and improve myself and have lost a bunch of weight and my general outlook on life has improved. I met a really nice woman a couple of weeks ago and we clicked. I really like her, she likes me and hey things seem to be looking up. 

So the problem, we decided to become intimate and things seemed to be going good but I couldn't get hard. I was into it, wanted it but it just wasn't happening. First time ever for me that this occurred. I have no problem getting an erection if I masturbate so it's not physical but psychological. I still have in my head the crap my ex gf used to tell me plus I guess lingering guilt over my divorce. So how do I overcome this, because I really want to develop this into a healthy relationship.

TL;DR: Recently divorced, went through a bad abusive relationship, struggling to overcome psychological block to get intimate with new partner.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're taking steps to work on yourself and move forward. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with intimacy after a traumatic experience. Have you considered talking to a therapist about your feelings and experiences? They can help you work through some of the emotional baggage and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you've been through a lot. I think it's amazing that you're taking the time to work on yourself and prioritize your own healing. As for the intimacy issue, have you tried talking to your partner about it? Sometimes just being open and honest about your feelings can help alleviate some of the pressure and anxiety. You might also consider doing some gentle self-care exercises to help you relax and feel more comfortable in your own skin."
3. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: "OP, I'm so glad you're prioritizing your mental health. It's not easy to overcome the trauma and guilt you've experienced, but it's possible. Have you considered journaling or writing about your feelings and experiences? Sometimes putting your thoughts and emotions down on paper can help you process and release them. Additionally, you might want to try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation to help calm your mind and body."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I buy the whole 'I'm a terrible person' narrative from your ex. It sounds like she was trying to manipulate and control you. You deserve better than that. As for the intimacy issue, I think you should focus on building trust and communication with your new partner. Have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and experiences, and see if you can work through this together."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're doing great by acknowledging your feelings and seeking help. It's not easy to overcome the past, but it's possible. Have you considered doing some couples therapy with your new partner? A professional can help you both work through any issues and develop healthier communication habits. Additionally, you might want to try some fun and relaxing activities together, like going for a walk or watching a movie. Sometimes just having fun and laughing together can help you feel more connected and intimate."

TITLE: Current bf of 4 months wants to go on vacation without me and the thought of it is eating at me

POST: I'm a 17 year old female and he is a 21 year old male. We've been dating for about 4 months and we're madly in love with each other. He's never had a gf before me and i even took his virginity. We've never been apart for more than a day and when he mentioned the idea of him going to Austin, it kinda crushed me. I'm always telling him that he should hang out with his friends and i'm always supportive of whatever it is that he's doing so of course i acted like it was no big deal and i told him that i'm really excited for him and that he should definitely go. He could hear it in my voice that i was upset but i kept on denying it. 

HE'S ONLY GONNA BE GONE FOR 1 WEEKEND. Like i feel so dumb that i can't even handle 2-3 days without him. I feel so clingy and desperate. I trust him 100% but i DON'T trust the people that he's going with. One of the people going is his friend that i do not like at all. He's EXTREMELY rude to me almost every time he's comes over and he's rude to my sister and he's even a dick to my bf. He's vulgar and he's constantly getting sloppy drunk, and starting fights. He's a fucking cokehead for God's sake. 
And another person that's going is this girl that, for some reason, i have myself convinced she likes my bf. She's really flirty towards him and has pet names for him and everything. I don't trust her or anyone for that matter. 

I know all of them are just gonna be rude to him and take advantage of him while they're there but he doesn't see that. Ugh i feel so retarded.

Tell me i'm over reacting

TL;DR: 4 month bf wants to go on a weekend trip with friends, including someone i don't like and a girl i think is flirting with him. I'm feeling clingy and desperate and I don't trust the people he's going with. Am I overreacting?

TITLE: Should I encourage my boyfriend to exercise and eat better or is this his own issue to deal with?

POST: When I met my boyfriend almost two years ago, he was fit and in shape. We used to run together and go hiking all the time. He was stressed out for awhile and drank a lot, and six months ago he had to move away for a different job. His new location doesn't have nice places to exercise outdoors, and he hates exercising indoors. He has gained about 30lbs since I met him and I know it affects his self-esteem. He recently found out that he is "overweight" and he constantly calls himself fat. I tell him that I love him and that if he is unhappy with his body image, he should exercise. But, he always makes excuses. I wonder if I should encourage him more. Is this a good idea or should I let him deal with this issue on his own. I don't want him to take my encouragement as "I love you less because you're overweight." That's not the case. However, I do worry that if he continues to gain weight he could suffer health consequences since his family members have Type II Diabetes. I also just want him to feel better about himself. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Boyfriend gained 30lbs since we met, is unhappy with his body image, and makes excuses not to exercise. Should I encourage him more or let him deal with it on his own?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's great that you care about his well-being and want to support him. However, it's important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Instead of telling him he should exercise, ask him how he's feeling and what's holding him back. Maybe he's struggling with depression or anxiety, or maybe he's just not finding activities he enjoys. By listening to him and showing him that you care, you can help him feel more motivated to make changes."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not about telling him what to do, but about supporting him and being a positive influence. You could also try to find activities you can do together that he enjoys, like hiking or biking. This way, you're supporting his health goals and spending quality time together."
* "I think it's great that you're concerned about his health, but it's also important to respect his boundaries. If he's not interested in exercising or making changes, it's not your place to push him. You can encourage him and support him, but ultimately it's his decision. Maybe you could try having a conversation with him about how his weight gain is affecting him and how you can support him in making positive changes."
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about your concerns, but also be prepared to listen to his perspective. It's possible that he's struggling with body image issues or other mental health concerns that are contributing to his weight gain. By listening to him and showing him that you care, you can help him feel more comfortable opening up about his struggles."
* "I think it's great that you're concerned about his health, but it's also important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and challenges. Maybe he's dealing with something that's making it hard for him to exercise or eat healthy. Instead of focusing on his weight, maybe you could try to support him in other ways, like helping him find a job he loves or supporting him through a tough time. By being a positive influence and showing him that you care, you can help him feel more motivated to make positive changes."

This subreddit is dedicated to weight loss and fitness, and the community is generally supportive and encouraging. The comments on this post are no exception, with many users offering words of wisdom and advice on how to approach the situation. The general consensus is that it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to focus on supporting your boyfriend's well-being rather than trying to dictate what he should do. Many users suggest having a conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns, but also being prepared to listen to his perspective and respect his boundaries. Others suggest finding activities you can do together that he enjoys, or supporting him in other ways that don't involve exercise or dieting. Overall, the community is encouraging and supportive, and offers many helpful suggestions for navigating this sensitive topic.

TITLE: It pains me (22F) to see an ex (22M) of 3 years, in a relationship with someone else. How do I move forward?

POST: As mentioned in the title, I'm having trouble moving on from someone I dated 3 years ago. It's been a while, I'm in a good relationship now, yet one part or me can't shake this feeling of "what could have been?" With said ex. When I see him with someone else (online/school (we go to the same school)), I can't help but feel loss. 

I know my ex isn't right for me. I know I don't want him. Yet for some reason, I'm having trouble letting go of the last few feelings for him.

Fellow redditors and relationship gurus, can you give me any advice so I can help myself finally move forward and fully appreciate future relationships?

TL;DR: Ex of 3 years is in a relationship with someone else. I'm in a good relationship now, but seeing him with someone else makes me feel loss and I'm struggling to move on. Help!

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "It's normal to have lingering feelings, but it sounds like you're still holding onto the idea of what could've been. Try to focus on the present and the future with your current partner. You're in a good relationship now, and that's something to be grateful for. Remember that your ex is with someone else for a reason, and it's not because they're waiting for you to come back around."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings, but it's time to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what could've been, try to focus on what you gained from the relationship (e.g., personal growth, new experiences). Also, remind yourself that your ex is not the same person you dated 3 years ago. He's evolved, and so have you. You're in a new chapter of your life, and it's time to focus on the present and future."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're still hung up on someone who didn't even want you enough to stay in a relationship with you. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are. Don't waste your time dwelling on what could've been. Focus on building a strong, healthy relationship with your current partner, and remember that your ex is not the center of the universe."
4. **HonestHonesty**: "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings, but it's also important to recognize that your ex is not the same person you dated 3 years ago. He's moved on, and it's time for you to do the same. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship and the growth you've experienced since your breakup. Remember that your worth and value come from within, not from someone else's validation."
5. **RealTalk**: "Listen, it's okay to feel a little pang of sadness or loss when you see your ex with someone else. But don't let it consume you. You're in a good relationship now, and that's something to be proud of. Try to focus on the present and the future, and remember that your ex is not the only person who's moved on. You've moved on too, and that's something to celebrate."

TITLE: Just broke up with my [20F] boyfriend [21M] of 2 years for what I think was a good reason, I feel so horrible and empty.

POST: My boyfriend,  well I guess ex bf and I dated for a bit over 2 years, during which we lived together. We were not perfect and had many problems but were committed to working it out. We did argue frequently but both knew that we loved each other. I don't know how it happened but over time, my romantic attraction towards him decreased to the point that it's pretty much non existent. 

He's my best friend. I love talking to him and being around him, but when it comes to sex or intimacy I just can't do it. I thought long and hard and chose to end the relationship half out of respect for him. I feel everyone deserves to be in a relationship where both parties want each other equally. I can't offer him that and want him to be happy in his future. As well although I know he was never mad about it. I was also feeling increasingly guilty over the lack of sex in our relationship because of me. 

To me these are all logical points ( correct me if I'm wrong),  but my emotions are getting the best of me. I wish I could change the way I feel. Now I just have this horrible void in me. He was such a big part of my life and I'm just hoping I made the right choice.. Please give advice/opinions, he's saying I just didn't try hard enough. I just want to lay in bed forever..

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years because I lost romantic attraction towards him, but still love him as a person. Feeling guilty, empty, and unsure if I made the right choice.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and accept your feelings, even if they're not what you expected. It's not selfish to prioritize your own emotional well-being and happiness. Remember that you can't force feelings, and it's okay to acknowledge that this relationship wasn't working for you. You did what you thought was best for both of you, and that's something to be proud of. Take care of yourself during this tough time, and don't be too hard on yourself."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You did what you thought was best for both of you, and that's all anyone can ask for. It's not your fault that your feelings changed, and it's not your responsibility to 'try harder' to maintain a relationship that's no longer working for you. You deserve to be happy, and if that means ending a relationship that's no longer serving you, then so be it. Don't let guilt and self-doubt consume you. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of."
3. **u/justanotheruser**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling with the guilt and uncertainty. I want to offer a different perspective: maybe your ex-boyfriend is not the right person for you, and maybe this breakup is an opportunity for you to discover what you truly want and need in a relationship. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not compatible with your ex, and it's okay to move on and find someone who is a better match for you. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your life. You got this, OP!"
4. **u/relationshipcounselor**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. As a relationship counselor, I can tell you that it's not uncommon for people to experience a decrease in romantic attraction over time. It's not necessarily a reflection of your ex-boyfriend's worth as a person, but rather a natural part of relationships. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and accept your feelings, and I'm proud of you for doing so. Remember that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time. Take care of yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it."

These responses offer a range of perspectives and advice, from acknowledging the OP's feelings and validating their decision to encouraging them to focus on their own happiness and well-being. The responses also highlight the importance of self-care and seeking support during difficult times. Overall, the community is supportive and understanding, offering words of encouragement and validation to help the OP navigate their emotions and move forward.

TITLE: I fixed something! One stupid little thing that I broke to begin with is now working again.

POST: As the new admin of IT at my library, I inspire confidence in all the employees just by being here while they work on their computers. When anything electronic needs any kind of maintenance, repair, instillation, etc. *I ride down from Mt. Olympus and activate my powers of computing to quicken all the digital world.*

The only problem is that **I am shit with computers.** I have no idea how I got this job because most of you reading this probably know better how to use them than I do. I broke explorer by trying to install an update. *I'm that bad at it.* 

But I fumble through this and everyone cheers! "Great job, Crazybay. You are vital to our staff, CrazyBay." "Do you want another raise? No? How about we just buy you subway once a week, put you on salary, and pay your cell phone and internet bills?"

I recently screwed up one of my bosses computers pretty bad (it may have not actually been my fault but probably was). After a full weekend of stress and reading dozens of pages of stuff on support.microsoft.com, I not only unbroke it, but I also installed the ghetto new circulation system on her office computer!!

This shouldn't matter as much as it does to me but now I feel just the slightest bit validated in receiving the beef-up paycheck that came with the job.

TL;DR: I'm a terrible computer person, but I fixed something! I'm a little proud of myself.

---

This post is a great example of the "off my chest" subreddit, where users can share their personal stories and experiences, often with a humorous tone. The author, Crazybay, is a new IT admin at a library and is struggling to keep up with the demands of the job. Despite being terrible with computers, Crazybay managed to fix a few issues and is feeling proud of themselves.

The post is relatable because it shows that even people who are not tech-savvy can still accomplish things and feel a sense of accomplishment. The author's humor and self-deprecation make the post entertaining and engaging, and the community's response is supportive and encouraging.

The post also highlights the importance of validation and recognition in one's work. Crazybay's boss's praise and the offer of additional benefits make them feel valued and appreciated, which can be a powerful motivator. The post shows that even small accomplishments can have a big impact on one's confidence and sense of self-worth.

TITLE: Me [44 F] with my friend [44 F] 32 years, I lied to her 25 years ago and having anxiety about it now.

POST: She and I have been best friends since we were children and have been through a ton of shit together and are still best friends to this day. 

She liked a guy when we were 19 years old and they had slept together a couple of times.  He didn't want a relationship but she did, so she ended it but still had feelings for him.

I do not remember the time in between but he came on to me and I slept with him.  She had moved away by this time. Word traveled fast and she found out and confronted me on the phone.  She asked if it was just once and I said yes.  She asked if I was drunk and I said yes.  Both are not true.  It was twice and I wasn't drunk.  No excuses.  I broke the girl code.  I was so afraid of losing her that I thought this way she would know kind of what happened and I had a better chance of retaining the friendship.  I am honest when I say there was no maliciousness involved in not telling her.  Truth is, I was and may still be a coward. Come to find out years later I trickle truthed her. 

I have generalized anxiety.  For whatever reason lately, this incident is first and foremost in my head when the anxiety hits.  I keep thinking I should tell her but it may just be to assuage my own guilt and a way to reduce the emotional pain.  I have spoken to my psychologist about this and he said that it was so long ago and she knows the act that happened that there is no need to hurt her again unnecessarily.  He seems to think that my anxiety is looking for an outlet and has latched on to this event.  I honestly hadn't thought of the event in years.  So much has happened in both our lives (marriages, children, etc) that it seems like ancient history. I don't know what to do and would appreciate some outside perspective.  Thank you.

TL;DR: I lied to my best friend 25 years ago about sleeping with her ex, and now I'm having anxiety about it and wondering if I should tell her the truth. I've been friends with her since childhood and we've been through a lot together. I'm torn between telling her the truth and potentially hurting her again, or keeping the secret and living with the guilt. I've spoken to my psychologist and he thinks it's just my anxiety looking for an outlet, but I'm still unsure. I would appreciate any advice or perspective on this situation.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my boyfriend [21 M] and our 1 year anniversary fiasco

POST: To keep things short and sweet, we live about 2 hours from each other and today was our 1 year anniversary. I took off as did he and I made the trip last night to go visit him so we could celebrate our 1 year together. Today however, we did nothing but look for clothes for his new job as a server.

We woke up early and tried to make things snappy, as 4PM rolls around we're finally wrapping things up but we're both frustrated because we wanted to have a day together to do 1 year anniversary things (go to museums, get food, go see a movie). Due to it being such an ordeal going from shop to shop, mall to mall that by the end of it we didn't have time to do any of it because everything would be closed after we battled through city 5o'clock traffic. He had a melt-down because I wanted to go back home and sleep in my own bed because I was exhausted and I didn't see a point in staying if he had to work at 7AM the next day.

My question to you, reddit; Am I totally out of line for being upset that he didn't really take care of his commitments before hand or am I just a needy little bitch? Please help me understand his side because I so badly want to get over this but I just cant understand his train of thought when I stopped my multiple projects a day early so I could come on Wednesday night and not Thursday morning.

TL;DR: We had a 1 year anniversary fiasco, I took the day off to visit him and we ended up spending it looking for clothes for his new job instead of doing anniversary activities. He had a meltdown when I wanted to go home and sleep in my own bed because I was exhausted.

---

**Reddit's Response:**

* **Comment 1:** "You're not being needy, you're being reasonable. You took the time to come visit him and celebrate your anniversary, and he didn't make an effort to make it special. It's not about being needy, it's about feeling appreciated and respected in a relationship."
* **Comment 2:** "I think you're being a bit harsh. It sounds like he was stressed about his new job and didn't realize how much time it would take to find clothes. Maybe he didn't mean to ruin the anniversary, but he didn't make an effort to make it special either. Communication is key in relationships, maybe you should talk to him about how you felt and see if you can work through this together."
* **Comment 3:** "I'm on your side, OP. You took the time to come visit him and he didn't make an effort to make it special. It's not about being needy, it's about feeling valued and respected in a relationship. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize your feelings and needs."
* **Comment 4:** "I think you're being a bit too hard on him. It sounds like he was stressed about his new job and didn't realize how much time it would take to find clothes. Maybe he didn't mean to ruin the anniversary, but he didn't make an effort to make it special either. Maybe you should talk to him about how you felt and see if you can work through this together."
* **Comment 5:** "I'm a woman and I've been in a similar situation before. I can tell you that it's not about being needy, it's about feeling appreciated and respected in a relationship. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize your feelings and needs. You should talk to him about how you felt and see if you can work through this together."

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community is divided on this issue, with some users siding with the OP and others suggesting that the OP is being too harsh. However, the majority of users agree that the OP has a right to feel upset and frustrated in this situation, and that communication and understanding are key to resolving the issue. The OP is encouraged to talk to their partner about how they felt and work through the problem together. Ultimately, the outcome depends on how the couple chooses to communicate and address the issue.

TITLE: 18 year old guy, first relationship. Please help.

POST: We split up in the middle of the summer because she was leaving for the semester, and she wasn't into me anymore (or so she claimed). We got back together at the end of the summer temporarily when our families stayed at the same hotel for a week during vacation.

She left for the semester, started hooking up with a douche who eventually cheated on her and got expelled. I made a terrible decision and hooked up with one of her friends and had a brief fling with another one. I was incredibly depressed and looking for someone to cling to for support. She had a brief fling with another guy and is currently pursuing a third. We talk a lot over email and chat, although it's mostly me who initiates contact. Towards the beginning of the semester I asked several times if she wanted to get back together and she said it was too early to tell. The last time, I pressed her for an answer (was a month or two ago), and she rejected me pretty brutally.

She came back for thanksgiving break and didn't particularly want to see me, although she wasn't totally opposed to it. She went to a random party and hooked up with several guys but apparently they weren't particularly desirable. She posted a bunch of shit on her tumblr about lost love and missing someone. She could mean me, or could mean the guy she's currently pursuing. I have no idea. She posted a picture with the caption: "You used to be alright. What happened?" and said "[name], lovie, this is for you."

Those are the facts and I have no idea what to make of them. I think she still has feelings for me, but is also angry/disgusted with my hooking up with her friends. I've apologized and explained myself to her, and I don't know how best to help the situation now.

I would really like to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know if that's possible or how best to go about doing that. My idea was to give her some space for a month (aka no contact) and seeing how she feels when she gets back. Am I an idiot? What should I be doing? I have no idea what to do. Please please help.

TL;DR: 18 year old guy, first relationship. We broke up, got back together temporarily, and then she left for the semester. She's been hooking up with other guys, and I've been talking to her over email and chat. She's been posting stuff on her tumblr about lost love and missing someone, and I'm not sure if it's about me or someone else. I want to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know how to approach it. Should I give her space for a month and then try to talk to her again? Am I an idiot? Help.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 18, you're allowed to make mistakes. You hooked up with her friends, she's hurt, and now she's moving on. You need to respect her boundaries and give her space. Don't try to contact her for a month, and when you do, be honest and apologize again. If she still wants to get back together, great. If not, you'll know and can move on."
* "I think you're being too clingy. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing. You're still depressed from the breakup, and you're trying to cling to her because you're scared of being alone. Take some time to work on yourself, and then you can re-evaluate your feelings for her."
* "I think she's just using you as a crutch. She's posting about lost love and missing someone, but she's also hooking up with other guys. She's not over you, but she's not willing to put in the work to make it work either. You deserve better than someone who's just using you to feel better about themselves."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings for her. You're still hung up on her, but she's clearly moved on. You need to focus on yourself and find someone who truly cares about you. Don't waste your time trying to get back with someone who's just using you as a rebound."
* "I think you should try to talk to her again, but this time, be honest with yourself about your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just trying to hold onto something that's already gone? Be honest with her too, and see if you can work through your issues together. If not, then it's time to move on."

TITLE: I [17f] cannot figure if crush [19m] is interested in me or just bored. How can I ask?

POST: So I've been chatting on fb almost weekly for substantial periods of time (20 min - 1 hr) with a boy who graduated from my school last year for almost a year now and I can't tell if he actually enjoys our conversations or feels obligated to respond and wishes I would leave him alone. I've been able to see him in person a couple of times since he left for college (once when I visited his city and asked and once when he came back and said he'd try to see me, which he did.) over Christmas break I tried to see him and he was busy (legitimately so, I believe, but there was no mention of trying another time) and when I messaged him he took much longer than usual to reply so I decided not to try contacting him in case he was trying to get rid of me (I almost always start the conversation.) A little over two weeks later, he messaged me and we talked for about an hour. I messaged him about a week after to say our school had posted a baby photo of him (he's the son of two teachers, that's why it was posted) and we talked for a while. There wasn't a clear ending to the conversation as we seemed to miss when the other was online but we were having a good conversation when he just stopped responding. It's been three days and he hasn't even read the message. 

I can't figure out what's going on here. Does he actually want to be friends or does he just like talking to me when he's bored or am
I the annoying girl who can't take a hint? Can I ask about it? I'm worried to say anything because it'll probably come off as needy (and maybe it is) and I'll look extremely insecure but at the same time I'm tired of constantly wondering about this. I hate that I get worked up waiting for him to reply and I'd just like to know what he's thinking so I know if it's even worth it to continue making an effort to be friends. 

What should I do? Is there any eloquent way to approach this or should I just let it be?

TL;DR: I've been chatting with a guy for almost a year, but I'm unsure if he's genuinely interested in me or just bored. He takes a long time to reply sometimes, and I'm worried I'm coming on too strong. Should I ask him about it, or just let it be?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Honestly, it sounds like he's just not that interested in you. If he was, he'd make more of an effort to keep the conversation going and wouldn't leave you hanging for so long. I'd say it's time to move on and focus on someone who actually values your time and attention.
2. **relationship_advisor**: I agree with throwaway123456. It's possible that he's just not that interested, but it's also possible that he's just really busy with school and life. If you're feeling uncertain, you could try sending him a casual message asking how he's doing and if he's got any free time soon. If he doesn't respond or seems uninterested, it might be time to move on.
3. **skeptical_sarah**: I think you're overthinking this. He's a busy college student, and it's normal for him to take a while to respond. Maybe he's just not as into chatting as you are. If you're feeling anxious about it, try taking a step back and focusing on other things. You don't need to be tied down to someone who doesn't seem to be making an effort.
4. **confused_cindy**: I'm in a similar situation with someone, and I think it's worth asking him how he feels. You can say something like, "Hey, I've noticed that you've been taking a while to respond lately, and I'm starting to feel a bit uncertain about our conversations. Are you still interested in chatting with me, or is there something going on that's making it hard for you to keep up?" It's a gentle way to ask without coming on too strong.
5. **relationship_expert**: I agree with confused_cindy. It's okay to ask him how he feels, but make sure you're not coming across as needy or clingy. You could try framing it as a question about your own feelings, like, "I've been feeling a bit uncertain about our conversations lately. Do you feel the same way, or is there something I'm missing?" This way, you're showing that you're interested in his feelings without putting too much pressure on him.

---

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are divided, with some people advising the OP to move on and focus on someone who is more interested in her, while others suggest asking the guy how he feels about their conversations. The OP is left to decide whether to take the risk of asking him and potentially being rejected, or to move on and focus on other things. Ultimately, the decision is hers to make.

TITLE: F/20 Should I be worried about our future together?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for six months and we're planning on living together this coming fall. He and I won't see each other during the summer months since we'll be in different states working, and we'll move in together right when he gets back. I am one hundred percent ready to make this leap with him, but what makes me hesitate is that he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves, and that he feels more fulfilled when he is alone because he is more productive. This brought on the topic that he thinks that living together like this will either solidify our relationship or end it. I think it's a bit strange to bring this up while still planning on moving in together... Our relationship has been a bit rocky because of the lack of productivity together. When we're together, we just want to BE together: not be bothered by friends, school, etc. Just be in each others company. This has made both of our grades suffer, and friendships. Which has soured the relationship. We both said that when we look back on our history together, it's been great but not as great as it could be because of how little we have actually done. I am just worried that this isn't the right step to take in our relationship if he feels so rocky about it, and if our relationship is based off of a history of non-productivity. 
Have any of you been in this situation? And what did you do to fix it? Or can it be fixed?

TL;DR: F/20, boyfriend and I are planning to move in together this fall, but he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves and that he feels more fulfilled when he's alone. He thinks living together will either solidify our relationship or end it. I'm worried about the future of our relationship and if it's based on non-productivity. Has anyone been in this situation and how did you handle it?

TITLE: [21m/22f] Dating for 18 months, no plans for the future...?

POST: Hi /relationships, this is my first post. I read the rules, but please let me know if I missed anything :)

So I've been dating this wonderful girl for about a year and a half now. She absolutely adores me, would do anything for me, and I would do the same for her. We're both college grads and live near each other in a bigger city. 

But as much as I enjoy our relationship and feel devoted to her, when I look to future I can't see us together. Whenever I think about moving in together, or even getting engaged, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't picture marrying her. I can't picture marrying anyone right now.

I think what we have is just a "comfortable" relationship. But when do I need to either commit to the next step or break it off? She was looking at apartments online the other day and started using words like "we" when describing moving into them. We had a talk about how I wasn't ready for anything a few months ago and she seemed to be on the same page, but lately she's been hinting at the long-term kind of things, and says her family is asking her about me and our plans as well.

TL;DR: Been dating for 18 months, no plans for the future, feeling stuck and unsure of what to do. Girlfriend is hinting at long-term commitments and I'm not sure if I'm ready or if I even want to be with her long-term.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're just not ready for a serious relationship. That's okay! It's better to be honest with yourself and your partner than to pretend to be something you're not. Maybe have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and see where it takes you."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit unfair to your girlfriend. She's been with you for 18 months and has been making an effort to plan a future together. You need to take a hard look at your own feelings and priorities. Are you really not ready for a commitment, or are you just not ready to commit to her?"
3. **relationship_ruth**: "I think you need to have a conversation with your girlfriend about what you're feeling. It's possible that she's feeling uncertain or insecure about your future together. Try to be open and honest with her about your feelings and see if you can work through this together. Remember, relationships are about growth and communication."
4. **confused_couple**: "I'm in a similar situation with my partner. We've been together for 2 years and I'm not sure if I'm ready for marriage or kids. We've been having open and honest conversations about our feelings and priorities. It's not easy, but it's helping us grow and understand each other better. Maybe try having a similar conversation with your girlfriend?"
5. **honest_hannah**: "Honestly, if you're not sure if you want to be with her long-term, then maybe you shouldn't be with her at all. It's not fair to string her along or lead her on. If you're not ready for a commitment, then it's better to be upfront and honest with her. You can always re-evaluate your feelings later and see if you're ready to commit."

**What do you think? Should the OP have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings, or is it better to take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities?**

TITLE: TIFU by calling out a line cutter

POST: I was at a grocery store last night, picking some stuff up for a date, and I got in line at the express counter, but a man came over and stood in front of me. At first I thought I'd let it go, but then decided to say something, so I said something alone the lines of "hey, um, sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I was standing right there when you came over and got in line..."

And he let me go in front of him, at first apologizing but then said "it's not a big deal, you don't have to have a cow about it."

First of all, WTF is this, 1998? Second, I wasn't having a cow, I was trying to be as polite as possible in letting him know he'd cut me in line. So now I am a little agitated, and said "well you don't just cut people in line!" and we got into an argument about whether he knew what he was doing. He said "fuuuuck yoouuu" and I said "fuck you too," and he flew off the handle, started calling me a bitch over and over as I was paying for my stuff. It was really, really terrible and I was badly shaken by the end of it.

I know I wasn't nice, it was a bad idea to engage after he made that "have a cow" comment, should've given him the benefit of the doubt when he said he didn't see me, and I really didn't need to return the f-bomb he hurled at me. Should've just let it go.

TL;DR: I called out a line cutter at the grocery store, and it escalated into a huge argument, with him calling me a bitch and me saying some not-so-nice things back.

---

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/tifu, which stands for "Today I F**ked Up." The author of the post is sharing a story about a situation where they made a mistake, and it's a great example of how a small incident can quickly escalate into a bigger problem.

In this case, the author was trying to be polite and let the line cutter know that they had cut in front of them, but the situation quickly turned sour. The line cutter became defensive and argumentative, and the author ended up saying some things they regret.

The post is a great example of how easy it is to make a mistake and how quickly a situation can escalate. It's also a reminder to take a step back and think before reacting, especially in situations where emotions are running high.

The comments on the post are also great, with many people sharing their own stories of similar situations and offering advice on how to handle them. It's a great community for people to share their mistakes and learn from each other.

TITLE: I[m19] want to know best way to not get boring to a girl [f22] who I kinda have a thing with

POST: So im starting to get to know this girl[f22] better and I[m19] want to make sure I dont get boring, it has happened to me before.  We just spent 2 weeks together at a spring class thing that was in the mountains.  There was about 10 of us that built a pretty tight nit group but me and her hit it off real well.

Since we were with each other basically 24/7 for two weeks, we didnt have to text to talk(could just talk in person) or have to plan to hangout, it just happened but now that were back home I want the "thing" to go somewhere but im afraid I will get boring.

What do you all think i should do to not get boring and to get this to go somewhere.  Oh and one more thing, she does have a slight concern that where to far apart in age but she doesn't consider is a huge deal and she seems to be interested in taking it further as well.

TL;DR: I[m19] want to know best way to not get boring to a girl[f22] who I kinda have a thing with, we spent 2 weeks together in the mountains and now I want to take it further but im afraid I will get boring.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're 19 and she's 22, that's not that far apart in age. Focus on building a connection with her, not trying to be someone you're not. Be yourself, be genuine, and show her that you're interested in getting to know her better. Don't try to be someone you're not, it'll only lead to boredom and disappointment."
2. **u/DatingCoach99**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Instead of worrying about being boring, focus on having fun and being present in the moment. Take her out on dates, try new things together, and have conversations that are meaningful and interesting. Don't overthink it, just be yourself and see where things go."
3. **u/Redditor12345**: "I think you're overestimating the importance of not being boring. At the end of the day, it's about finding someone who is compatible with you and who you're compatible with. If you're genuinely interested in her and she's interested in you, then don't worry about being boring. Just be yourself and see where things go."
4. **u/SarcasticSally**: "I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're 19, she's 22, it's not like you're 10 years apart or something. Just relax, be yourself, and have fun. If she's interested in you, she'll like you for who you are, boring or not."
5. **u/AdviceGuru**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Instead of focusing on not being boring, focus on building a connection with her. Ask her questions, listen to her, and show her that you're interested in getting to know her better. Don't worry about being boring, just be yourself and see where things go."

TITLE: My boyfriend [18M] is very angry at me [18F] because I don't like jewelry.

POST: We have been together over two years, but got in a very large fight today. We have large fights occasionally where my boyfriend just gets blinded by his anger. 

I have never ever liked jewelry, and haven't worn a single item of jewelry since elementary school, my ears aren't even pierced. Even with this fact, my boyfriend continues to buy me jewelry.

I haven't been rude about it up until this point, because you shouldn't ever really refuse a gift. But I do make a point to him that I don't like jewelry, and never wear it, while trying to be as polite as possible. For some reason, he can't understand this about me and continues to get angry that he buys me jewelry I don't wear, etc. etc. He just seems to not understand I don't want this type of typically "nice" gift. I still thank him for the original intent, but at what point should he start treating me as a person with individual likes and dislikes? He just expects me to like typical "girl"  things. He's very upset with me and calling me ungrateful. Sigh. Maybe he's right. It's just something I will never be able to like but am expected to be grateful for anyway :/ 

Also, I would understand if we just started dating, but it's been two and a half years of this. I don't want to lie to him about my interests though.

He is also trying to break up with me right now....but he does that every time he gets angry.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is angry at me because I don't like jewelry, even though I've told him multiple times. He thinks I'm ungrateful and is trying to break up with me. I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

1. "I think your boyfriend is being ridiculous. You've told him multiple times you don't like jewelry, and he's still buying it for you. That's not respecting your boundaries. You don't have to like or wear jewelry just because it's 'typically' something girls like. You're an individual, and your boyfriend should be okay with that."
2. "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your boyfriend is really struggling to understand and accept you for who you are. Two and a half years is a long time to be in a relationship, and it's not fair to expect you to change who you are to fit his expectations. You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for all your quirks and preferences."
3. "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how his behavior is making you feel. Tell him that you appreciate the thought behind the gifts, but that they're not something you're interested in. Also, explain to him that his anger and accusations of ungratefulness are hurtful and unfair. Maybe he'll realize that he's been taking you for granted and will make an effort to understand and respect your boundaries."
4. "I think your boyfriend is trying to control you by making you feel guilty for not liking something he thinks you should like. That's not a healthy dynamic in a relationship. You need to stand up for yourself and tell him that you won't be manipulated into liking something you don't want to. You deserve better than that."
5. "I'm so sorry to hear that your boyfriend is trying to break up with you over this. That's not a healthy way to handle conflict. You deserve someone who will work through issues with you, not try to break up with you every time they get angry. Take some time to think about whether this relationship is really worth it for you."

TITLE: F[19] Met a very nice guy, but he is leaving very soon!

POST: Basically, I've recently met this very nice boy that I instantaneously fell head over heals for. He's very sweet and I feel that he is perfect match for me and he feels the same! We've only known each other for a month and we are both 19.

Unfortunately... we're both young and in college and he is moving back in with his parents for the entire summer, starting on the 21st or so. So we'll be roughly 4 hours apart for around 4 months.

My question is, what should I do now? At this point I feel like I'm falling harder and harder for him, but I'm afraid that I'll be really sad and lonely when he leaves. Should I stop seeing him until he gets back? Or should we keep in touch? Help me not be irrational, because if he asked me to be in a long distance relationship with him, I might consider it.

TL;DR: Met a nice guy, but he's leaving for the summer and I'm worried about being sad and lonely. Should I stop seeing him until he gets back or keep in touch?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's normal to feel sad and lonely when someone you care about leaves. But it's also normal to want to make the most of the time you have with them. If you're both on the same page and willing to make an effort to stay in touch, I'd say go for it! You can always talk about your feelings and concerns with him. Maybe you can even plan visits or video calls to stay connected."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're 19, he's 19, and you're both in college. You're not going to be stuck in a long distance relationship forever. Just enjoy the time you have with him and focus on your own goals and aspirations. When he gets back, you can re-evaluate your feelings and see where things go. Don't stress too much about it."
3. **DatingCoach99**: "I'd say it's great that you're thinking critically about your feelings and the situation. It's true that you might feel sad and lonely when he leaves, but it's also important to consider the bigger picture. If you're both willing to make an effort to stay in touch, it could actually bring you closer together. Just make sure to communicate openly and honestly with each other about your feelings and expectations."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I'm a bit concerned about the age gap and the fact that you're both in college. Are you sure you're ready for a relationship? Maybe you should focus on your studies and personal growth before jumping into something serious. Just something to think about."
5. **LoveIsInTheAir**: "Aww, I'm so happy for you! It's great that you've found someone you connect with. I'd say go for it and make the most of the time you have with him. You can always talk about your feelings and concerns with him. And who knows, maybe you'll find a way to make the long distance thing work. Just remember to prioritize your own happiness and well-being above all else."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [19 M] of 2 months and am having second thoughts about it

POST: I've been dating my boyfriend for two months now. We started dating a month after we started talking, and at the beginning it was rough because it was summer after college and we were both home, not being able to see each other for a few months. After coming back for school (a few weeks now), I realized that being together isn't all that great. I feel like we having nothing to talk about, differences in humor, he's prone to "teasing me" (makes jokes about acne, weight, etc.) that became increasingly irritating. I don't actually feel like I like him emotionally, but since I've never been in a relationship before, I can't tell if this is just me being too picky and having high expectations. Should I break it off, or is 2 months of dating too short to really know if I "like" someone? I mean, when we're being nice and actually talking and laughing, I feel great, but other time, I have to constantly ask myself if I'm actually enjoying the relationship or just wasting my time.

TL;DR: 19F, 2 months into a relationship with 19M. Feeling like we have nothing to talk about, differences in humor, and he's annoying me with jokes about my appearance. Feeling unsure if I like him emotionally, and wondering if 2 months is too short to know if I'm compatible.

REPLIES:

* "Honestly, 2 months is a decent amount of time to get a feel for someone. If you're feeling like you're not connecting on a deeper level and it's just surface-level stuff, it might be worth having a conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Maybe you're just not compatible, and that's okay. It's better to figure it out now than to waste more time."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to have ups and downs in a relationship, especially in the beginning. Maybe try to focus on the things you do enjoy about your boyfriend and see if you can work on the things that are bothering you. And honestly, if he's making jokes about your appearance, that's a major red flag for me. You deserve someone who makes you feel good about yourself, not someone who tries to tear you down."
* "I think you're being too picky. Two months is a short amount of time, and it's normal to have some growing pains in a relationship. Maybe try to give it a little more time and see if things improve. And honestly, if you're not feeling a strong emotional connection, that's okay. Not every relationship is meant to be a deep, emotional connection. Sometimes it's just about having fun and enjoying each other's company."
* "I think you're being too focused on the negative. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and see if you can find some common ground. And honestly, if you're not feeling a strong emotional connection, that's okay. Not every relationship is meant to be a deep, emotional connection. Sometimes it's just about having fun and enjoying each other's company."

(This reply is similar to the second one, but with a slightly different tone)

Overall, the replies to this post are mixed, with some people advising the OP to have an open and honest conversation with their boyfriend about their concerns, while others are more skeptical and think the OP is being too picky or focused on the negative. Some people also mention that it's normal to have ups and downs in a relationship, especially in the beginning, and that it's okay if the relationship doesn't work out. However, there is a general consensus that the OP's concerns about their boyfriend's behavior and the lack of emotional connection are valid and worth exploring. The replies also highlight the importance of communication and self-reflection in relationships.

TITLE: I 29F am feeling very insecure about my 32M boyfriend 3 years because he had cheated on me in the past. I need some tips and advice.

POST: Parker and I have been together for 3 years. Very very early on he cheated, and we went to couples counseling because he was very determined to make me feel important and make the relationship work. It ended up helping a lot and we have a good relationship.

But there is that just nag in the back of my head that I am so insecure. I am open with him about being insecure at time but he just says I need to not worry about things, and that he has done what he can to help me with my insecurity but he doesn't know what else to do and it is up to me to get over my insecurites. Which I get that, he said it from a place of love and I wasn't upset.

Every relationship I have ever been in I have been cheated on. Which sucks, and it sucks that it happened with Parker but I am just a little screwed up from being cheated on so much.

I want this to work with Parker, and I trust him but sometimes I just feel so insecure. Last night a pretty girl at the bar we were at who he is friends with came up and started talking to him and it was harmless and whatever but on the inside I just felt so insecure.

I have a great career and a good life and yada yada. I just don't even know what to do. I know I will kill the relationship if I continue on like this. 

Help :(

TL;DR: I've been cheated on in the past and my current boyfriend (3 years) cheated on me early on. I'm still insecure and it's affecting our relationship. I want to work through this but I don't know how. Any advice?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're still insecure after being cheated on multiple times. It's not something that just goes away overnight. Here's what I want you to do: take some time to reflect on why you're feeling insecure. Is it because you're worried that Parker will cheat on you again? Is it because you're worried that he's not fully committed to the relationship? Once you can identify the root of your insecurity, you can start working on addressing it. Maybe you need to have an open and honest conversation with Parker about your fears and concerns. Maybe you need to work on building your self-esteem and confidence. Whatever it is, I want you to know that you're not alone and that there are people who care about you and want to help you through this."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think it's great that you're acknowledging your insecurities and wanting to work on them. That takes a lot of courage. Here's what I want to suggest: instead of focusing on Parker's past mistakes, try to focus on the present and future of your relationship. What are the things that you love and appreciate about Parker? What are the things that you're looking forward to in your future together? When you focus on the positive, it can help to shift your perspective and reduce your insecurities. Also, it might be helpful to have a conversation with Parker about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're still struggling with insecurities and see if he can offer any support or guidance. Remember, relationships are a two-way street and it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it."
3. **u/cheatersaretheworst**: "OP, I'm so sorry that you've been through this. It's not fair that you've been cheated on multiple times and it's not fair that Parker cheated on you early on. But here's the thing: you deserve better. You deserve someone who will treat you with respect and honesty and loyalty. If Parker is truly committed to making things right and working on your insecurities, then that's great. But if he's not willing to put in the effort to make things right, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve someone who will prioritize your feelings and well-being above all else. Don't settle for anything less."
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think it's amazing that you're willing to work on your insecurities and that you're open to having conversations with Parker about them. That takes a lot of courage and vulnerability. Here's what I want to suggest: instead of focusing on the past, try to focus on the present and future of your relationship. What are the things that you're looking forward to in your future together? What are the things that you're grateful for in your relationship right now? When you focus on the positive, it can help to shift your perspective and reduce your insecurities. Also, it might be helpful to have a conversation with Parker about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're still struggling with insecurities and see if he can offer any support or guidance. Remember, relationships are a two-way street and it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I just wanted to add that it's not uncommon for people who have been cheated on to struggle with insecurities. It's a normal part of the healing process. But it's also important to remember that you are not defined by your past experiences. You are a strong and capable person who deserves to be loved and respected. Don't give up on yourself or your relationship. Keep working on building your self-esteem and confidence, and remember that you are worthy of love and respect."

TITLE: I [19 M] have been with my girlfriend [19 F] for 2 years. She just told me that she was not a virgin the first time we had sex a year ago. Am I crazy for feeling betrayed and wanting to end the relationship?

POST: To preface, I was really open about sex in the beginning of the relationship. I told her that while I do not mind if she had done it with anybody before, she should let me know as I had never done it with anyone before her. I also made it very clear that I wanted to give up my first time with somebody special, and a year into the relationship, I decided she was the one. I had 3 fairly serious girlfriends before her, but I never got to the point where I wanted them to be my first. 

I honestly feel a little sick looking back on our relationship now. She would joke about how she took my v card and how I took hers. She always said how she was happy I was her first. I feel really betrayed that she could lie to me so easily for so long in the relationship. I believe this is the end of the relationship. 

Am I crazy for feeling so betrayed? I'm talking to my girlfriend tomorrow to likely end the relationship.

TL;DR: I was told I was her first, but she just revealed she wasn't. I feel betrayed and want to end the relationship. Am I crazy for feeling this way?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're not crazy for feeling betrayed. You were promised something that wasn't true, and that's a huge deal. It's not just about the sex, it's about the trust and honesty in the relationship. You deserve better than someone who would lie to you like that."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being reasonable. You had a right to know the truth, and she should have been honest with you from the start. It's not about being 'crazy' for feeling betrayed, it's about being hurt and feeling like your partner didn't respect your boundaries and values."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I think you're being a bit dramatic. It's not like she lied about something huge, like cheating or abuse. It's just a little white lie about something that's not even that important in the grand scheme of things. Maybe you're just looking for an excuse to end the relationship?"
4. **u/honestyisthebestpolicy**: "I agree with the others, you're not crazy for feeling betrayed. Honesty is key in any relationship, and she failed to deliver that. You deserve someone who will be truthful with you, even if it's hard to hear. Don't settle for someone who will lie to you just to avoid hurting your feelings."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're being too harsh. Maybe she was just trying to spare your feelings or make you feel special. It's not like she lied about something huge, and it's not like she's a bad person. Maybe you could try to have a conversation with her and see if there's a way to work through this?"

**Reddit's response:** The majority of the comments on this post are in support of the OP's feelings, with many users agreeing that he has a right to feel betrayed and that honesty is essential in any relationship. Some users suggest that the OP may be being too harsh, but overall, the consensus is that the OP's feelings are valid and that he deserves better from his partner. The post has received over 1,000 comments and has been upvoted over 10,000 times.

TITLE: TIFU by trying a social experiment

POST: to start off and give context I work got a seasonal job at a big amusement park chain of which I wont name for privacy purposes. as an employee we get free tickets and passes. one of the rules that come along with them are that we are only allowed to give them away and not sell them. well on Facebook i tried to see how many people who i don't regularly talk to would suddenly want to be my best friend when i offered to sell these passes at a discount rate. after a few hours of it being up and getting the results i was expecting i deleted the post. 

today i was called into the security office of my job and they interviewed me in a small room for about a 1/2 hour before telling me that i was suspended and would be under investigation. kept my cool because i did nothing wrong and never actually sold them but still it means less hours this week and a smaller pay check

TL;DR: I tried a social experiment on Facebook by offering to sell my free amusement park passes at a discount rate to see how many people would suddenly want to be my friend. It worked, but I got caught by my job and was suspended and put under investigation.

COMMENT 1:

Dude, that's a great experiment! I'm a bit surprised you got caught, though. Did you expect that many people to bite?

COMMENT 2:

I'm a bit confused - you didn't actually sell the passes, so what's the big deal? You just offered to sell them, right?

COMMENT 3:

I think you're being a bit naive. You broke the rules of your job, even if you didn't actually sell the passes. You're lucky you didn't get fired on the spot.

COMMENT 4:

I think this is a great example of why social media can be a bad idea. You thought you were being clever, but really you were just being reckless and irresponsible. Good job getting caught!

COMMENT 5:

I'm a bit curious - what did you learn from this experiment? Was it worth the consequences?

COMMENT 6:

I think you should be grateful you didn't get fired. You got a taste of what it's like to break the rules and get caught. Maybe next time you'll think twice before trying something like this again.

COMMENT 7:

I'm a bit surprised you didn't get in trouble for posting about it on Facebook in the first place. I mean, what if your boss saw it? That's a pretty big risk to take.

COMMENT 8:

I think this is a great example of why we should all be careful about what we post online. You thought you were being clever, but really you were just being reckless and irresponsible. Good job getting caught!

COMMENT 9:

I'm a bit curious - what did your boss say to you during the interview? Was it a stern lecture or did they seem understanding?

COMMENT 10:

I think you should be grateful you got suspended instead of fired. You got a second chance to think about your actions and maybe learn from your mistakes. Maybe next time you'll think twice before trying something like this again.

TITLE: Is hypnosis as  learning possible?

POST: I've happened to see/read a lot about hypnotists being able to "instruct" people to do things while in some form of a hypnotic state (like the classic sleeper agent spy who will perform an act when his hypnotic state is activated). There have been plenty of movies and entertainment TV shows that showcase this, including one I saw a while back that purported to show that it was possible and effected. There's also the use of hypnosis as for drug/alcohol/mental status therapy that has plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this.

However my question revolves around whether students could be hypnotized and taught material as is in a normal class and usefully retain that information when not in a hypnotic state? I'm a college student and (no surprise here) the idea occurred to me while cramming for an exam.

TL;DR: Can students be hypnotized and taught material while in a hypnotic state, and retain that information when not in a hypnotic state?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I'm a psychology student and I can tell you that the idea of hypnotizing students to learn is a bit of a myth. While hypnosis can be effective for certain tasks, it's not a reliable way to improve learning or retention. In fact, most studies have shown that hypnotized students don't perform any better than non-hypnotized students. Additionally, hypnosis is not a magic solution that can make someone learn something they're not interested in or capable of learning. It's still important to engage with the material and practice regularly to retain information."
2. **u/ScienceNerd3000**: "I've worked with hypnotists in the past and while they can be very effective for certain tasks, I'm skeptical about the idea of using hypnosis to learn new information. The problem is that hypnosis is a state of heightened suggestibility, which means that people are more likely to accept suggestions that they might not normally accept. This can be useful for things like pain management or anxiety reduction, but it's not necessarily the best way to learn new information. In fact, some studies have shown that people who are hypnotized are more likely to forget information than those who are not hypnotized. So while hypnosis can be a useful tool, it's not a magic solution for learning."
3. **u/AskRedditUser**: "I've been hypnotized before and it was a really interesting experience. The hypnotist was able to make me do some pretty weird things, like clucking like a chicken or reciting a poem backwards. But as for learning new information, I'm not sure it's the most effective way. I mean, I was able to learn some new things while I was hypnotized, but I'm not sure how much of it stuck. And when I came out of the trance, I felt a bit disoriented and confused. So while hypnosis can be a fun and interesting experience, I'm not sure it's the best way to learn new information."

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for the responses, everyone! I was hoping to get a more balanced view on this topic. I think I was getting a bit carried away with the idea of using hypnosis to learn new information, but it's good to know that there are some limitations to it. I'll definitely keep this in mind for future learning endeavors. Thanks again for the input!"

TITLE: Me[20M] and my girlfriend [21F] of 9 months tells me she does not want me in her life seemingly out of the blue.

POST: A little background.  We have been dating for almost 9 months and have had ups and downs with stresses of attending school and both doing hard science majors.  

Basically she claims that I only do nice things for her when something is going wrong and that when she does nice things (like a small note) I don't say anything.  We have had arguments of this before and it had seemingly been resolved.

Now that it is the summer and she is back home with her family about 5 hours away from me.  I visited about 3 weeks ago and we had an amazing time.  We both wish we could have spent the whole summer together.  

Last week she was agitated with her family, specifically her dad and brothers and I had spent a lot of time talking to her about her frustration.  She said she did not feel like she was loved enough.  So for the last week or so I have been trying to do nice things for her here and there because of this (like sending a handwritten card, and flowers).  As this has been happening she seems to be getting more distant with me.  I try and get at what is really bothering her and she is does not give me a straightforward answer. 

Then last night she just goes off on me late at night.  Saying I am not good enough for her and that I am a self centered a-hole.  Telling me to f off and she doesn't need me.  Just continues to say all of these extremely hurtful things to me.  I didn't try and reason with her much, just told her that whether you ever believe me or not I care for you deeply (and things along those lines).

It seems like she is taking all of her anger out on me from other things going on in her life and I do not understand how to respond.  Should I try and talk to her or just leave her alone for while?  I am at a loss of what to do because it seems like it is coming out of nowhere.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 9 months tells me she doesn't want me in her life, seemingly out of the blue. I've been trying to do nice things for her, but she's getting more distant and says I'm not good enough for her and I'm a self-centered a-hole. I don't know how to respond or if I should try to talk to her or leave her alone for a while.

---

**Community Response:**

The community responds with a mix of empathy and advice. Some users suggest that the OP should take a break from the relationship to focus on himself and his own well-being, while others recommend trying to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend to understand what's really going on.

One user suggests that the OP's actions may have inadvertently contributed to his girlfriend's feelings of frustration and resentment:

"I think you're missing the point. She's not saying you're not good enough for her, she's saying you're not meeting her emotional needs. You're doing nice things for her when she's upset, but you're not acknowledging or appreciating the small gestures she makes. It's like you're only responding to her when she's in crisis mode, rather than being present and supportive in the everyday moments."

Another user recommends taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship:

"I think you need to take a step back and assess whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. If your girlfriend is consistently speaking to you in a hurtful and abusive manner, it's not okay to just 'try to talk it out' or 'leave her alone for a while.' You deserve better than that. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and if that's not happening in this relationship, it may be time to re-evaluate whether it's worth your time and energy."

Overall, the community encourages the OP to prioritize his own emotional well-being and to consider seeking outside help or support if needed.

TITLE: TIFU by studying for finals

POST: This happened yesterday, after a 6 long day marathon of studying for three finals that are right after each other, I was ready to begin my winter break. I called up my uncle to pick me up and two hours later he finally showed. He asked me to drive since I know my way around my campus more so I did. Little did I know, 12 cans of Monster, 4 hours of sleep and the adrenaline pumping through my veins because of the excitement of winter break would impair my driving skills. As I pulled out of the parking space, I drove directly into a cement pillar causing $3000 worth of damage to the front of my car. I didn't even get out of fucking parking garage. I had to use my shoe strings to keep the bumper from falling off and hitting the front wheel. On the bright side, I got high marks this quarter.

TL;DR: Studied for 6 hours, got 4 hours of sleep, drove impaired and crashed into a cement pillar, causing $3000 worth of damage.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author's excitement and exhaustion from studying for finals led to impaired driving, resulting in a costly accident.

The post is well-written, with a clear and concise summary of the events that unfolded. The author's use of humor and self-deprecation ("I didn't even get out of fucking parking garage") makes the story entertaining and engaging. The inclusion of the "TL;DR" (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary at the end is also a nice touch, providing a quick and easy way for readers to understand the main point of the post.

Overall, this post is a great example of a "TIFU" story, and its relatable and humorous tone makes it a fun and engaging read.

TITLE: I [25F] wasn't invited to birthday gathering of 5 months [25M]

POST: Hi, my feelings are a little hurt and I think this is a sign I should end this situation with a guy I'm seeing but I need some help in organizing my thoughts.

I seen this guy about 1-3 times a week for the past 5 months and we communicate every single day. Last week I started getting weird vibes from him (he doesn't cuddle with me as much and looks at his phone more). After I left his apartment, he hasn't tried to initiate any conversation for about 5 days. His birthday was coming up and he was inviting his friends to hang out (both female and male) and did not invite me. I messaged him the day of his birthday  to congratulate and asked if he was doing anything. He explained again he's going to hang out with his friends, but made no mentioning that he wanted me there. He also later in the night hung out with coworkers as well to celebrate.

In the past I've planned things for us and asked myself to hang out with him but generally if he's already out with people and I ask to join,  he has a reason I shouldn't be there. He takes a lot of initiate so I think he just didn't want me there at his birthday.

I feel like if I express my feelings I will seem needy. He's not my boyfriend. I feel like I don't seem important enough in his life to want me there to celebrate for him.

I would like to continue to be his friend, but how do I express that I get the sense he doesn't like me as much anymore and it's better to end it now and the lack of invitation was a sign he didn't want me there?

TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing for 5 months didn't invite me to his birthday gathering, didn't initiate conversation for 5 days, and I feel like I'm not important enough to him anymore. How do I express my feelings without seeming needy?

TITLE: Getting mixed signals from a girl I'm interested in [21/m][25/f]

POST: I went out to a bar last night with a coworker, her boyfriend, and her cousin. The night started off okay, me and the cousin where chatting and getting along pretty well. Then her 'ex' (they talked for a while but he told her he wasn't looking for anything serious) showed up and they spent a while talking to each other. He eventually left and I ignored her for a while (I mean c'mon she shunned me for an ex). Next thing I know she grabs my hand and we are alone outside the bar making out (I assumed it was a "I hate me ex I'll just make out with you" type thing, but she is cute and I had a few drinks in me so I went with it).

After the kissing ended I mentioned her ex and she apologized profusely and said she had no idea he was going to be there and she just isn't sure how to act around him yet. She said it's totally over between them. We talk about how we both are looking for a real relationship and we are definitely interested in getting to know each other more. We exchange numbers and make plans to see each other today, but nothing was set in concrete. My coworker asks me today what I thought of her, I said she's pretty cool and ask if she said anything about me, apparently "i'm a good kisser". 

So I call her this afternoon and ask about a time to hang out, she says she is going to lunch with a friend and will get in touch afterwards and let me know a good time (I was at work till later the evening anyway). She then texts me a few hours later saying she forgot she had plans with a friend and she is free tomorrow if we want to get together then. Now I have become pretty jaded with dating and the opposite sex in general, so I immediately doubted her "prior plans". Not too mention I'm not the most confident person in the world so I immediately assume that she's blowing me off. 

Am I over thinking things? Do I have legitimate concerns? I'm definitely interested in this girl and I want things to work, but I don't want to waste my time either.

TL;DR: Girl I'm interested in gave me mixed signals, kissed me, said she's over her ex, but then seemed to be blowing me off. Am I overthinking things or do I have legitimate concerns?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're overthinking this. She's giving you mixed signals because she's still figuring out her feelings. Don't be too hard on yourself, just relax and see where things go. If she's not interested, she'll let you know eventually."
2. **u/datingadviceguru**: "I think you're being a bit too paranoid. She's giving you mixed signals because she's still processing her emotions from the breakup. Give her some space and don't take it personally. If she's interested, she'll make an effort to see you."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I think you're right to be concerned. She's giving you mixed signals and it's hard to trust someone who's still got feelings for their ex. Maybe take a step back and re-evaluate if this is someone you really want to pursue."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you're being too cynical. She's giving you mixed signals because she's still figuring out her feelings, but that doesn't mean she's not interested in you. Give her a chance and see where things go. You never know, she might surprise you."
5. **u/realistic_rick**: "I think you're being too optimistic. She's giving you mixed signals and it's hard to trust someone who's still got feelings for their ex. Maybe it's best to just move on and find someone who's more emotionally available."

TITLE: I (24, female) found out that my boyfriend (23, male) responded to a male seeking male casual encounters ad on Craigslist while out of town. Advice needed!

POST: Background info: He and I have been dating for a little over 6 months. Basically fell head over heels, and moved in quickly together. We had plans to move to a new city in August where I will be starting my first year in law school. We have an apartment reserved and everything is taken care of. I have never had any suspicions and he treats me better than anyone I've ever been with. He makes me feel beautiful and worthy of companionship. 

A couple of weeks ago he was sent out of state on a short 5 day business trip. He works for a retail company and was helping to set up a new store. 

Since his return, he's just been a little off. I felt horrible (and still do) but I did something shitty and went through his phone. 

Found out he had responded to a man looking for man casual encounters ad on craigslist. His email sounded very comfortable, as he knew the acronyms and typical format. He sent it the day he got out of town. The man responded 3 days later, to which my boyfriend offered to host. There is no other communication that I could find.

When I confronted him, he said that he has no idea why he even responded to the ad. He said he didn't want to actually meet up, but had the urge to talk to someone online only. He claims that what I have read is the only communication he had and that he has never physically cheated on me. He also said that this is the only instance where he was interested in talking to a man sexually. 

I have no idea what to do. I love and care about him deeply and I have never connected so easily with anyone. I do not know what to believe and whether what he is saying is bullshit.

TL;DR: Boyfriend responded to a male seeking male casual encounters ad on Craigslist while out of town. He claims he didn't want to meet up and only wanted to talk online. He says this is the only instance of him being interested in a man sexually. I'm torn between believing him and ending the relationship.

ADVICE NEEDED!

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT COMMUNITY**

**Top Comment:** "Honestly, it's not about whether or not he actually followed through with meeting up, it's about the fact that he felt the urge to respond to an ad in the first place. That's a red flag. He's been dishonest with you, and even if he didn't cheat, he's still broken trust. You deserve better than someone who would engage in this kind of behavior. Take the time to think about what you want and what's best for you."

**Other Comments:**

* "I would take a step back and assess the relationship. Has he been open and honest with you about his feelings and desires? Has he respected your boundaries? If not, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "It's not just about the act itself, it's about the fact that he felt the need to hide it from you. That's a sign of a lack of trust and respect in the relationship."
* "You deserve someone who is honest and open with you. If he's willing to lie to you, what else is he hiding?"
* "It's not about whether or not he actually cheated, it's about the fact that he was willing to engage in behavior that could potentially put you at risk. You deserve someone who prioritizes your safety and well-being."
* "Take the time to think about what you want and what's best for you. You don't have to make a decision right now. Take the time to reflect on the relationship and what you're willing to accept."

**OP's Follow-up Post:**

"Thank you all for your advice and support. I've been thinking a lot about the relationship and what I want. I've decided to take some time for myself and focus on my own healing and growth. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I deserve someone who respects and values me. Thank you again for your wisdom and support."

TITLE: My boyfriend M(22), and I F(21) have been dating for 3.5 years but I suffer from an anxiety disorder and this has given him severe performance anxiety. How can we stop the positive feedback loop?

POST: I suffer from an anxiety disorder, which has recently gotten much worse with both of our college graduations coming up, my classes being very work heavy and fear that I might be doing poorly at work. Because of this, I burst into tears when he is unable to become erect (which used to only happen rarely when he was too tired but now it happens every time). He told me he becomes incredibly anxious when we are about to become intimate because he really wants to perform well and he really really does not want to make me cry but this makes it impossible for him to become erect, then I cry... 

Yes, I have really tried very hard to be supportive and pretend like it doesn't bother me but that is really difficult (and frankly, I am a terrible liar). Especially when he can hear me sobbing in the other room afterwards. I cannot stop it from happening! I try to hide the crying from him but I know he knows, and that makes him anxious which makes him unable to perform next time.

How can we stop this positive feedback loop and have stress free, enjoyable sex again?

TL;DR: My boyfriend has severe performance anxiety due to my anxiety disorder and crying when he can't perform. We're stuck in a positive feedback loop and I'm desperate for help to stop it.

---

This post is a great example of how a couple's relationship can be affected by mental health issues.

The OP is seeking advice from the r/relationship_advice community, which is a great resource for people looking for guidance on how to navigate complex relationship issues.

TITLE: 22 and whining about parents... (ranting ahead)

POST: I spent four years living half a country away from my parents, and those four years were great, but expensive. So when my parents moved closer to me, I moved in with them, looking to save money and finish school. 

It's been going pretty well. I go to church with them once a week (they're fundamentalist Christians), I don't drink or go to parties and I work to pay for school. They cover my room and board, and occasionally drive me around. 

Last week however, I had a friend come up from Toronto, (about an hour and a half away.) I went to a movie with said friend (Magic Mike) and told my parents I was going to see Abe Lincoln. Ignoring the fact that it's not as terrible as it sounds, that I'm 22 and lying to my parents, my mother somehow found out. 

Now she's all cold and "I'm too angry, we'll talk about it later" and I want to be like "no! We're not going to talk about it later. We're not going to talk about it ever, because it's none of your business." I appreciate what they've done for me, and they've been a huge help, especially in the last few months, but sometimes I want to tell them that parts of my life have nothing to do with them. 

I'm tired of not dating because they won't approve of the guys I date and sick of listening to her every single week, "will you be in heaven with us?"

TL;DR: 22 and living with parents, lied about going to a movie with a friend, mom found out, now I'm stuck in a situation where I feel like I'm being controlled and judged all the time.

TITLE: What's your, "Everything happens for a reason" story?

POST: My story:

I was not the most hardworking kid in highschool and therefore found it extremely difficult to find scholarships or grant money for when i actually started going to college.

In November 2011, I moved in with my grandparents. Almost immediately, i got a job in order to pay for my college expenses. At the time my grandparents were having an incredibly hard time supporting themselves, let alone me. I had been basically fiscally abandoned by my parents with little to no money, to my name. Anyways my grandparents were beginning to think about filing for bankruptcy. My grandfather was on his way home from work one day early in October (2012), fell asleep at the wheel and was killed in the resulting car crash. His life insurance settlement paid off for nearly 500k. My grandfather whom i loved with all my heart, wanted nothing more than to see me get a college education. Now just shortly after 7 months later, I'm graduating with my associate's degree with a 4.0. Hopefully in another few years, i'll be on my way to being a surgeon, and making enough money to take care of my grandmother, who has helped take care of me.

TL;DR: My grandfather passed away in a car accident, but his life insurance settlement paid off for nearly 500k, which allowed me to pay for college and pursue my dreams.

COMMENTS:

* "This is an amazing story. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but it's clear that your grandfather was looking out for you even in death. Congratulations on your degree and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors."
* "Wow, what a powerful story. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but it's clear that your grandfather's legacy lives on through you. You're an inspiration to many and I'm sure you'll make a difference in the world."
* "I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but it's amazing to see how your grandfather's passing has led to this incredible opportunity for you. You're an amazing person and I'm sure you'll make the most of this chance. Congratulations on your degree and I wish you all the best in your future."
* "This is an incredible story. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but it's clear that your grandfather was a selfless person who wanted to make sure you had a better life. You're an inspiration to many and I'm sure you'll make a difference in the world."
* "I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but it's amazing to see how your grandfather's passing has led to this incredible opportunity for you. You're an amazing person and I'm sure you'll make the most of this chance. Congratulations on your degree and I wish you all the best in your future."

This post is a great example of how the "Everything happens for a reason" concept can be applied to a person's life. The OP's grandfather's passing may have been a difficult and painful experience, but it ultimately led to a life-changing opportunity for the OP. The comments on the post are also a great example of how people can come together to offer support and encouragement to someone who is going through a difficult time. The post and comments demonstrate the power of resilience and the importance of finding the silver lining in difficult situations.

TITLE: Is the extra attention you're getting actually slowing down your progress?

POST: Hi all! I'm 25/m 5'8", been dieting and exercising for about 12 weeks now. Dropped about 20 pounds, starting at 240 and currently standing at 218 this morning. When I started, I stayed away from a lot of social gatherings and just focused on my program. Well honestly I was just a bit self-conscious about how much I gained. I also have a skin condition on my face that causes rashes to break out a lot. Anyway, I skipped out on a lot of birthdays, graduations, etc. Around week 8 I felt confident enough to start going out again, the diet has pretty much eased the rashes on my face and I'm more clear than I have been in awhile. My friends noticed my weight loss immediately. These days I'm starting to attend more gatherings and kind of regretting it, haha. I find it hard to stay away from all the drinks and snacks that come along with it. From starting at a pace of 2-5 pounds lost every week, I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully I haven't gained.

TL;DR: I started dieting and exercising, lost 20 pounds, started going out again, noticed weight loss, now having trouble staying on track due to all the food and drinks at gatherings.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, congrats on the weight loss so far! It's great that you're feeling more confident and comfortable in your own skin. However, it's not surprising that you're struggling to stay on track with all the temptations around you. It's like you said, you're getting extra attention and it's hard to resist the treats and drinks. Maybe try setting some boundaries for yourself, like only having one drink or bringing a healthy snack to share. It's okay to indulge every now and then, but don't let it become a habit. You got this!

COMMENT 2:
I totally get where you're coming from, OP. I've been in a similar situation before. It's hard to resist the temptation of food and drinks when you're around friends and family. But here's the thing: you don't have to give up your social life to stay on track. You can still attend gatherings and have fun while making healthier choices. Try to focus on the people and the experiences, rather than the food and drinks. And hey, if you do slip up, don't beat yourself up over it. Just get back on track and keep moving forward. You're doing great, OP!

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not going to lose weight at the same rate forever. It's normal to plateau, and it's not because you're "slowing down" or "giving up". It's just your body's natural response to the changes you've made. Instead of focusing on the scale, try to focus on how you're feeling. Are you feeling stronger, more energetic, and more confident? That's what matters most. And hey, if you do happen to gain a pound or two, it's not the end of the world. You can always get back on track and keep moving forward. You're doing great, OP!

COMMENT 4:
OP, I think you're getting a little too caught up in the attention you're getting. Don't get me wrong, it's great that your friends are noticing your weight loss, but don't let it define your self-worth. You're more than just your weight or your appearance. You're a person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Try to focus on the things that make you happy and fulfilled, rather than the attention you're getting. And hey, if you do happen to gain a pound or two, it's not the end of the world. You're still the same person you were before, and you're still worthy of love and respect. You got this, OP!

TITLE: How do I get a solid response from a girl I've asked out 3 times and gotten an iffy response in return, but I KNOW is interested in me?

POST: I met this girl on Okcupid. We hit it off and after a few messages I asked her out to dinner in which she replied "I'm really busy for the next couple weeks, but I'll see what I can do". I figure she's letting me down nicely and never expect to hear from her again.

Four days later she messages me back with her number! Word. We text back and forth a few times over the next few days and I ask her out one more time and I get the same sort of response. However, I figure she's being honest because she not only gave me her number in the first place, but has talked about sex, that she wanted to teach me how to dance, and all this other stuff that proved she was really interested. If anything, the fact she keeps responding to me, someone she's never even met, tells me she's being honest.

So after this, I go on vacation to Florida where I am currently (it's been almost two weeks). I asked her if she was busy next week again, but made a rookie mistake, gave her another thread at the same time, and she latched onto that instead of the real inquiry I was interested in. Oh well. A few days later (about 3 or 4 days ago) I ask her again and she replies "I'll see what I can do :)".

So here I am today. I get back on Friday. I've been talking to this girl somewhat for roughly 3 weeks. What do I say to get her to commit to a date on Saturday? If she gives me another iffy response should I keep trying MORE? I mean as long as she's responding, she's clearly interested right? I just don't want to come off as pathetic seeing as this is like the 4th time I've asked her out.

TL;DR: Girl I've been talking to on Okcupid has given me iffy responses to my asks out, but I'm convinced she's interested. How do I get her to commit to a date on Saturday and what if she gives me another iffy response?

---

**Top comments:**

* "Dude, you're overthinking this. Just be direct and ask her out again. If she says no, then she's not interested and you can move on. If she says yes, then you've got a date. Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be."
* "I think you're reading too much into her responses. 'I'll see what I can do' is a pretty standard response when someone is busy. It doesn't necessarily mean she's interested. Maybe she's just being polite. Try asking her out again and see how she responds. If she says no, then you know for sure."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your approach. You've asked her out three times and gotten iffy responses. Maybe it's time to take a break and focus on other things. You don't want to come across as desperate or clingy. Give her some space and see if she reaches out to you again."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about your feelings and see where it goes. Ask her what's going on and why she's been giving you iffy responses. Maybe there's something going on in her life that's making it hard for her to commit to a date. Be honest and open with her and see if you can work through it together."
* "I think you should just be yourself and not overthink it. If she's interested, she'll let you know. If not, then you'll know that too. Don't try to manipulate or guilt trip her into going out with you. That's not going to end well for anyone involved."

TITLE: TIFU By Texting My Sister.

POST: This happened last Friday night, but the consequences didn't fall upon my person until today.

Bit of a back story for relevance - I am temporarily living with my Mother again and she stared dating this guy, we'll call him "Stew". Stew is a major doucher and uses her, then makes her feel like shit, when I come home from work I have to deal with it. They've been on and off dating for 5 months now.

So last Friday night Stew and my Mother have another falling out, where my Mother comes home all upset because he is being a major asshole again. After she settles down and goes to bed, I text my sister about it. I wax poetic of how much of a prick Stew is and how I am tired of having to run damage control.

Just as I send it, I realize that instead of starting a new conversation with my sister, I actually responded to an old group text my Mother sent to me, my sister and... Stew.

The next day when I come home from work my Mother says she was pretty pissed at me, at first, but then realized I was right and told Stew this was wake up call for both of them. From the way she put it, it was implied everything was fine and they even made plans to go out of town next weekend.

So today I come home from work and my Mother is in tears, informing me Stew just broke up with her, and he used my text message as an excuse. She then goes on to tell me she'd rather be treated like shit then be alone.

Now my whole family hates me.

TL;DR: I texted my sister about my Mother's boyfriend being a prick, but accidentally sent it to the group text with my Mother and the boyfriend, causing him to break up with her and now my whole family hates me.

TITLE: What to consider when preparing a roadtrip from SoCal to NorCal?

POST: My spring break started yesterday and I am planning to go from Southern California to Northern California stopping at various universities along the way.  I'm coming from Los Angeles and will be stopping at UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, and finally stopping at UC Davis.  I am planning on going the entire week so I will seperate out the car trips, so it would be 4 hours each trip to each location.

I have taken into consideration food and gas fees.  Was wondering if I would need to know the location of hospitals and emergency rooms just in case.

This is my first time planning such a trip and I will be going alone.  I also need help convincing my parents to let me do this.  What should I tell them?  I am 19 and consider myself responsible.  They used to be very leniant but have recently cut back due to increasing stories of teenagers getting in car accidents in my area.

TL;DR: Planning a road trip from SoCal to NorCal, stopping at various universities, and need advice on what to consider and how to convince my parents to let me go.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Make sure to check the weather forecast before you leave and plan accordingly. You don't want to get stuck in a sudden rainstorm or heatwave. Also, consider downloading a traffic app like Waze or Google Maps to help you navigate and avoid traffic jams. And don't forget to pack snacks and water for the road!"
2. **u/CalBearFan**: "As a Cal alum, I can attest that UC Berkeley is an amazing school. Make sure to check out the campus, especially the Greek Theatre and the Campanile. Also, be prepared for some crazy traffic in the Bay Area, especially during rush hour. And don't forget to try some of the amazing food in the area, like the famous Berkeley Bowl!"
3. **u/UCSDStudent**: "UC San Diego is a great school, but be prepared for some crazy traffic in San Diego too. Make sure to check out the campus, especially the Geisel Library and the Student Union. And don't forget to try some of the amazing food in the area, like the famous La Jolla Cove!"
4. **u/ParentOfTeen**: "As a parent, I would be worried about your safety on this trip. Make sure to check in with your parents regularly and let them know where you are and when you'll be arriving. Also, consider getting a roadside assistance service, like AAA, in case you break down or get a flat tire. And don't forget to pack a first aid kit and a spare tire!"
5. **u/ResponsibleTeen**: "I'm 19 and I've taken road trips by myself before. It's not as scary as it seems! Just make sure to plan ahead, check the weather and traffic, and stay alert on the road. And don't forget to enjoy the trip and take in the sights!"

TITLE: TIFU by texting my mom a pornhub video link

POST: Alright, so I couple days ago i was browsing the hubs, if you know what I mean, on my phone. To be honest, I was in the mood for a quick boosh before I hopped in the shower. I was looking for videos to go along with my boosh and I noticed the video would not play. I copied the video link to try it in a few different browsers.

Fast forward to today, My dad and I have been looking for a car to purchase. We both went to look at one today and both my mom and aunt wanted to know what it was like. I texted my aunt first, explaining how it went. This is where the fuck up is. After i sent the message to my aunt, i tried to copy it so i can send it to my mom too since i'm too lazy to type one seperate for her. You can probably guess what went wrong. IT DIDN'T FUCKIN' COPY. I go to my mom and I's text conversation and I paste the pornhub video link (when i thought it would be what i sent to my aunt) and hit send immediately after i paste it. Lo and behold, I send a pornhub link to my mom.

I started to panic, not that i would be embarrassed or anything, but it is my mom i sent it to. That is a little weird. After i sent the link, i simply texted "Woops, meant to send something else" and then I pasted what was meant to be sent in the first place. She didn't say anything about the pornhub link, so I think she was completely oblivious to it. I haven't spoken to her in person yet, hopefully i got away with it.

TL;DR: I accidentally sent a pornhub video link to my mom instead of a text about a car. I quickly sent a follow-up text with the correct information and hope she didn't notice.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by not double checking the link before sending it"
* "I'm surprised she didn't notice, good job covering your tracks"
* "I would have just deleted the message and pretended it never happened"
* "You're a brave one, I would have died of embarrassment"
* "I hope your mom doesn't have a strong internet connection, just in case"
* "I'm sure your mom is just waiting for the perfect moment to bust you"
* "You should have just told her the truth, it's not like it's a big deal"
* "I'm surprised you didn't get a response from your mom, maybe she's just as embarrassed as you are"
* "You should have just deleted the app and pretended it never happened"
* "I hope you learned your lesson and will be more careful in the future"
* "You're a true hero, I would have never had the courage to do what you did" (sarcastic tone)

TITLE: My GF [26 F] wants me [26 M] to back out of lease with my BFF [27 F]

POST: I've been dating my girlfriend for two and a half years. I've recently had to move because I'm attending a graduate school partly because I wanted to remain close to her. The graduate school I got into was also the same graduate school my best friend who is a girl is also attending. This year I was trying to save money by living with a roommate and I thought my best friend would be great since we have spent alot of time and know each others habits. Originally my girlfriend gave the OK to live with my best friend, but now with two weeks before me and the best friend were supposed to move in we get into a huge argument and she says she doesn't want me to move in with my undergrad best friend. I don't want to back out because I gave my best friend my word and I feel like a jerk backing out in the last minute, but if I do live with her I know my girlfriend is going to resent me for the rest of the year.

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't want me to live with my best friend, but I already gave my word and I don't want to back out.

TITLE: Credit cards and Credit History. Is it safe to close old accounts?

POST: Hello!

I hope that someone can lend me some advice for a situation that I find myself in. Here's my situation:

About 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.

Now, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.

Recently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.

Now my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.

Will closing this account greatly affect my credit score?

I even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...

Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I have an old AMEX Delta card with a paid off balance, and I'm considering closing it and applying for a Bank of America cash rewards card. I'm worried about how this will affect my credit report. Will closing this account greatly affect my credit score?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/financialfreedom**: Closing an old account can potentially affect your credit score, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. The credit scoring model looks at the age of your credit accounts, credit utilization, and credit mix. Since you've had this account for 10 years, it's likely that closing it won't have a significant impact. However, it's always a good idea to check your credit report before closing the account to ensure there are no errors or outstanding balances.
2. **u/creditwhiz**: Closing an old account can actually help your credit score if you're not using it. It's called "credit utilization ratio" and it's the percentage of available credit being used. If you close an account and don't use it, it will help improve your credit utilization ratio. However, if you're closing an account with a high credit limit, it might affect your credit score negatively.
3. **u/personalfinancepro**: I would recommend keeping the account open and using it occasionally to keep the account active. This will help maintain a longer credit history and a higher credit utilization ratio. If you're not using the card, consider downgrading to a no-fee card or a card with a lower annual fee.
4. **u/creditexpert**: Closing an old account can affect your credit score, but it's not the end of the world. You can always reapply for the same card or a similar card in the future. It's also important to note that closing an account won't affect your credit utilization ratio, as it's based on the total amount of credit available to you, not the number of accounts you have.

**Conclusion:**

The comments provided a range of opinions on how closing an old credit account might affect one's credit score. Some argued that it might not have a significant impact, while others suggested that it could potentially affect the credit utilization ratio or credit history. Ultimately, the decision to close an old credit account should be based on individual circumstances and financial goals. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or credit expert before making any major changes to one's credit accounts.

TITLE: Landlord sold property - New landlord trying to increase rent during lease period.

POST: My fiance signed a lease with three friends last year, that started June 1st, 2014 (through May 31st 2015).  A month before that time, after being diagnosed with cancer, the landlord sold all his properties to a rental company.  The new company stated at that time that they'd honor all the old landlord's leases.

Fast forward to today, October 1st.  In this college city, leases that start on June 1st get signed in October for the previous year.  My fiance and her roommates intend on renting the property again (June 1st 2015 through May 31st 2016).  However, the rental company not only wants them to sign the lease for the next year, but sign one of their leases that superseeds the current one.  This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that they are also trying to raise the rent on the *current* lease by $30 per month.

My understanding is that a lease can't be altered by either party unless it is mutually agreed upon.  I don't know if that's the case if the property is sold, however.  Anyone have experience with this?

TL;DR: New landlord trying to increase rent on current lease, which started last June and runs through May 2015. Lease was signed before they bought the property. Can they do this?

TITLE: "Getting back out there" sucks.

POST: It's been two months since I (29m) broke up with my ex (23f). Since I have done a lot to improve myself. I doubled down on my schooling, lost 27 pounds, and have been doing more things that I enjoy. 

The issue is my breakup was amicable. We were just two people going separate ways. While it was mutually agreed upon the pain has still been pretty raw until recently. I now feel like I am in the position to start dating again! That's a pretty big step for me the only problem is I'm only meeting two types of women. The first group are women who aren't looking for anything at all besides friendship. That I am totally cool with but having the door open for a possible relationship would be nice. The other type is what gets me. The type of woman who wants to be in a relationship NOW, wants kids NOW, and wants it all delivered to her by a charming prince on horseback. The worst part is that this has happened a couple times in the last week and a half! 

It just seems like I can't find a happy middle ground. I really don't want to rush into anything and sitting around talking about some girls' guy troubles gets old quick when you have your own problems.

TL;DR: Amicable breakup, trying to get back out there, but only meeting women who want friendship or a serious relationship ASAP. Help!

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, I feel you. I went through a similar experience after my breakup. I think the key is to be honest with yourself and the women you're meeting. If someone is looking for a serious relationship, tell them you're not ready. If someone is looking for friendship, be upfront about that too. Don't lead anyone on or pretend to be something you're not. Good luck, and remember to be patient."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Lol, charming prince on horseback? You're being a bit dramatic, don't you think? Just be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. If someone is looking for a serious relationship, they'll find someone who is ready for that. Don't waste your time on someone who is looking for a 'charming prince' – you're not going to find that in a dating app."
3. **BreakUpBae**: "I went through a similar experience after my breakup. I think the issue is that you're looking for someone who is 'perfect' or'ready' for a relationship. Newsflash: nobody is perfect, and nobody is ready for a relationship. Just focus on getting to know someone as an individual, and see where things go. Don't put too much pressure on yourself or the other person."
4. **TinderTerror**: "I feel your pain, bro. I've been on Tinder for a month, and it's been a wild ride. I've met some crazy people, and some who are just looking for a hookup. My advice is to be clear about what you're looking for in your profile, and don't be afraid to swipe left if someone is looking for something you're not interested in. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor."
5. **RelationshipRookie**: "I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I'll give you some advice anyway. I think the issue is that you're trying to find someone who is 'perfect' or'ready' for a relationship. Instead, focus on finding someone who is compatible with you, and who you have a connection with. Don't worry too much about what others want or expect – just focus on what you want and need. Good luck, and I hope you find someone special."

TITLE: Fiancee [30F] wants an expensive wedding. How can I [30M] talk her down without looking cheap?

POST: My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a "$60k wedding" and "the groom/his family" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.

We can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.

The problem is that I don't want to just say "no" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.

What can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated

TL;DR: Fiancee wants a $60k wedding, but I think it's too expensive. How can I talk her down without looking cheap?

This post is a great example of how to ask for advice on a sensitive topic. The OP (original poster) provides a lot of context about their situation, including their cultural differences and financial concerns. They also show that they are willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of them.

The post has received many comments and responses, with some people suggesting that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with his fiancee about his concerns. Others have offered suggestions for how to approach the conversation, such as by framing it as a joint financial decision or by highlighting the benefits of a smaller wedding.

Some of the comments also touch on the cultural differences between the OP's fiancee and himself, and how these differences may be influencing their expectations around the wedding. For example, one commenter notes that in some Middle Eastern cultures, a large and expensive wedding is seen as a way to demonstrate one's wealth and status.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to ask for advice on a sensitive topic, and how to approach a difficult conversation with a partner. It also highlights the importance of considering cultural differences and financial concerns when making decisions about a wedding.

TITLE: Me [35 M] dating [36 F] for several weeks, she said "I'm too available"

POST: I recently started dating this woman, or rather started dating this woman again. I asked her out three years ago and we went on a few dates, and we didn't click. We remained friends, and we recently both found ourselves single. So, she asked me out to rekindle what we had going before. 

What attracted her to me was how much I had changed. Three years ago I was really immature with no real direction in life. Now, seven months after a devastating break up, I completely turned my life around. I've lost over 50 pounds. I'm exercising, eating clean and all around taking care of myself. Life is going awesome for me now.

So, she's back in the picture. Things are going really great between us. I'm trying new things with her that I haven't done with other women. I used to be a somewhat cold, cerebral person and not very affectionate. Now, I'm taking chances. I'm not overanalyzing and looking for "signs". I got handsy on her on our second date, I took a chance and kissed her. These things would take months in previous relationships. 

I've also decided to be more communicative. She likes to text, so I've reciprocated by texting her quite a bit. I've never been really chatty on text, but again, why not, I'm going to text as the mood strikes me, rather than again overanalyzing. We'll probably send each other like ten texts a day, although I find myself texting her more.

She gave some feedback to me which has got me thinking. She said that I'm too available. I'm not much of a challenge. Now I'm getting back into overanalysis mode. I sense I might be beginning to turn her off. How can I adjust my communication pattern with her to not be so "available" and be more "challenging"?

I'm a person who goes all out in self-improvement and my work, where my enthusiasm has brought tremendous results, but I'm sensing this might not be the best approach for relationships.

TL;DR: I'm dating a woman who said I'm too available, and I'm worried I'm turning her off. How can I adjust my communication pattern to be more "challenging" without losing my enthusiasm and self-improvement drive?

**Comments:**

* "I think she's saying you're too eager, not too available. You're putting too much pressure on the relationship by texting her 10 times a day. Try to find a balance and let her initiate some conversations."
* "I agree with the above comment. You're coming on too strong. Give her some space and let her come to you. You're not going to lose your enthusiasm and self-improvement drive by taking a step back."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She said you're too available, not that you're too enthusiastic. You're just being yourself and that's awesome. Don't change who you are to fit someone else's expectations."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Ask her what she means by 'too available' and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on the relationship. You're trying to make it work too hard. Just relax and enjoy the ride. If it's meant to be, it'll be. If not, then it's not the end of the world."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the feedback, guys. I think I was overthinking it and putting too much pressure on the relationship. I'm going to try to take a step back and let her initiate some conversations. I'll also try to be more mindful of not coming on too strong. I don't want to lose my enthusiasm and self-improvement drive, but I also don't want to scare her off. I'll have an open and honest conversation with her about how I'm feeling and see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. Thanks for the advice!

TITLE: I wish I could tell her.

POST: It's really kind of ridiculous. We'd been friends for so long, and when feelings started developing, I wasn't really surprised. I told her how I felt and she said it was the same for her, so we became a couple and it was really great. She was the first I'd been with that really supported me in my decisions, and I supported her in hers. 

When she left, it was so sudden I was really taken aback. She only ever said anything doubting us months beforehand, and when I asked to try and talk it out and help her feel better about it, she shrugged it off. I told her I would do anything to help make things the way she wanted them, but she said everything was alright, and for a while it was. 

We still talk sometimes, but god, every time I'm screaming in my head wondering what I did wrong. It's not even that I feel the need to be with her again, because I feel like it's important for us to find out the kind of person we want to be with and she decided I wasn't it. It's rough, but that's her decision. 

I just want to know why she chose to end it when it seemed so great. Now we just stay quiet and pretend it never happened, which is the worst part because we used to be so open with each other, well before we ever had any romance. Now that old friendship is gone.

TL;DR: I wish I could tell her why I'm still so hurt and confused about our breakup, but I don't want to reopen old wounds. I miss our friendship and I wish we could go back to the way things were before. 

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "I think you should talk to her. It's okay to be hurt and confused, and it's possible that she's feeling the same way. Maybe you can both find closure and move forward. Even if it's just a conversation, it might help you both heal."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but sometimes people just grow apart. It's not always about what we did wrong, it's about what we want for ourselves. Maybe she's found someone else who's a better fit for her, and that's okay. You deserve someone who loves and supports you too."
* "I think you should focus on yourself right now. You're still processing your emotions and trying to make sense of the breakup. Take some time to reflect on what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. When you're ready, you can try talking to her again, but for now, prioritize your own healing."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You can't control how others feel or act, but you can control how you respond to it. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the memories you shared. You deserve to be happy, and I'm sure you will be again."
* "I think you should write her a letter. Sometimes putting your thoughts and feelings down on paper can be therapeutic. You don't have to send it, but it might help you process your emotions and gain some closure. Just be honest and authentic, and see where it takes you." 

This subreddit is a place where people can share their deepest secrets and emotions, and the community is supportive and non-judgmental.

POST: I'm 30 years old and I've never had sex. I know it's not uncommon for people to wait until they're older, but I feel like I'm the only one who's still a virgin. I've had a few relationships, but they never seemed to go anywhere. I've tried online dating, but it's just been a bunch of shallow conversations and no real connections.

I feel like I'm missing out on something important. I see all my friends getting married and having kids, and I feel like I'm the only one who's still stuck in the past. I've tried to talk to my friends about it, but they just tell me to "get out there" and "stop being so picky." But it's not that easy. I'm scared of rejection, and I don't want to settle for someone who's not right for me.

I feel like I'm stuck in this rut, and I don't know how to get out of it. I've tried therapy, but it's not helping. I just feel like I'm alone in this, and it's a really isolating feeling.

TITLE: Reddit, I'm think that my friend is taking advantage of my goodwill.

POST: ( *My mom came to me today with this question. I told her reddit might help her out. This is what she typed:* )

I have a friend through theatre, that I help regularly with designing lights, set, and directing for a very small amount of money (stipend).  She is a high school theatre teacher who doesn't know much about technical theatre, so I have helped rescue some of her shows, that were pretty bad.  The principal has even told the teacher how impressed he is with my work (I get program credit for designs).  I love what I do, and I don't mind helping the program and her.  

The most recent show is a large scale musical, that requires hundreds of hours of research and construction, with lights and set.  **She is asking me for my sketches and other materials to put up in her classroom to "teach" her class how it is done.**  She likes to come in to the shop and try to change things.  

First of all there is no time, because she waits till the last minute to do everything.  

Secondly, she doesn't know what she's talking about.  

I feel like my methods (along with creativity) of designing are part of why my designs stand out.  I don't really want to share all of my research material with her because:                              

**1.** I worked really hard getting my degree in design and graduated with honors, and I don't feel responsible for teaching her how to do her job better. 

**2.** If I give her my info she will most likely come into the shop more often telling me how to do my job, wasting more time that I never have. 

What do I do without jeopardizing the relationship?

TL;DR: Friend is a high school theatre teacher who doesn't know much about technical theatre, and I help her with designing lights, set, and directing for a small stipend. She's asking me to share my research materials and methods, but I feel like she's taking advantage of my goodwill and doesn't appreciate my work.

**Edit:** I want to clarify that I'm not trying to be selfish or unwilling to help. I genuinely want to help the program and her, but I feel like she's not respecting my time and expertise. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation without damaging our relationship.**

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're being reasonable. You're not asking for much, just respect for your time and expertise. Maybe you could offer to help her in a more collaborative way, like working together on a project or having a meeting to discuss the design process. This way, you're still helping her, but you're also being recognized as the expert."
2. **u/techtheatrenerd**: "I'm a tech theatre nerd and I have to say, it sounds like your friend is taking advantage of your goodwill. You're not getting paid enough to be a teacher, and you're definitely not getting paid enough to be a mentor. You should set some boundaries and communicate them clearly to your friend. Maybe you could say something like, 'I'm happy to help you with the show, but I need to focus on my own work and can't spend too much time mentoring you.'"
3. **u/thespian**: "I'm a theatre person, and I have to say, it sounds like your friend is being really unprofessional. You're doing her a huge favor by helping her with the show, and she's not even acknowledging your expertise or respecting your time. You should talk to her about how you're feeling and set some boundaries. Maybe you could say something like, 'I'm happy to help you with the show, but I need to be treated with respect and have my expertise acknowledged.'"
4. **u/unsolicitedadvice**: "I'm not a theatre person, but I think you're being really reasonable. You're not asking for much, just respect for your time and expertise. Maybe you could try to find a compromise, like offering to help her with a specific aspect of the design process, but not sharing all of your research materials. This way, you're still helping her, but you're also being recognized as the expert."

TITLE: I (22/f) am crazy about my boyfriend (27/m), but we haven't been dating long. Should I wait to tell my family how close we are?

POST: Reddit, I am so insanely, head over heels in love with my boyfriend, J. 

Humble bragging about us: We met when I moved to a new area for my job in July/August. We had been really great friends for months and ended up getting together on Valentine's day. We got very serious very quickly and have spent nearly everyday together since (admittedly, it's a little bit much but it's the honeymoon phase and we can't get enough of each other).  I don't think I could have dreamt of a better match for me. J's brilliant, creative, confident and unbelievably kind. His humor is clever and nerdy and immature in all of the right ways. He is so thoughtful and amazing at communicating, which is especially important because that is not my best trait. I've never been able to talk to anyone the way I can with him... And I've opened up more with J than I ever thought I would (with anyone). I could go on for pages just gushing about how infatuated I am with him. 

Needless to say, we're both serious about this... we've said the I-love-you's and started looking for apartments to move in together in June. We're talking about long-term plans and I've already met a huge chunk of his family. It's real. I never would have imagined myself to jump into a relationship this quickly or intensely, but it's really real. And I'm thrilled!

I want to yell it from treetops and tell the world... but I'm worried that people might think I'm being silly or naive and rushing into it. I am very close with my family and desperately want to tell them that I love him  and how serious we've gotten but I would be really upset if they wrote it off as some sort of tryst. 

So that leads me to my question: Can I tell my family about my intense, new relationship? Or should I wait it out and bring it up on a more "normal" timeline?

TL;DR: I'm 22, in love with my boyfriend of 4 months, and want to tell my family but worried they'll think I'm being too hasty. Should I wait or share my feelings?

**Reddit's Response:**

**Top Comment:** "Honestly, it's great that you're so in love, but it's also important to remember that relationships can be unpredictable. It's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better before making big decisions. I would suggest waiting a bit longer before telling your family, maybe a few more months or until you've been together for a year or so. That way, you can get a better sense of whether this is a long-term thing or not."

TITLE: I [18M] met the right person [19F] at the wrong time.

POST: So, currently in college (that's our way of saying before university in the UK) and i've been with this girl for a year and a half. I love her, and think she's amazing. But the downside is, i'm 18. I want to go and experience lots of different things in lots of different places, but I can't go and travel and do amazing things with her. I want to go and do these things myself and make new friends. 

I'm worried however, that if I approach her with this she'll go for it, but when I come back she'll have moved on with the relationship. We both feel the same way about each other, that's clear. Another point to make is that she has made plans to go and travel around Australia herself. 

This may seem like a very selfish post, however I hope you can all understand that i'm young and want to expand my knowledge of the world and have my own individual experiences. For this to happen i'm looking at 2 or so years. Which is a long time I know, but as the title says, I met her too young. I'm not looking for criticism, i'm looking for people's own similar experiences and how they went about dealing with the situation. Thank you for reading, if I don't reply, i'm sleeping.

TL;DR: 18M in college, been with 19F for 1.5 years, but want to travel and experience new things, worried she'll move on if I take time off. Want to know how others have dealt with similar situations.

---

This post is a great example of a common dilemma many young people face: the desire to explore and experience new things, versus the commitment to a romantic relationship. The OP (original poster) is torn between his love for the girl and his desire for independence and self-discovery.

The post is well-written and provides a clear overview of the situation, including the OP's concerns and feelings. The use of the title "I met the right person at the wrong time" effectively conveys the OP's sense of frustration and uncertainty.

The post also raises interesting questions about the nature of relationships and the importance of individual growth and exploration. It's a relatable topic that many people can identify with, and the OP's willingness to share his feelings and concerns makes the post engaging and thought-provoking.

Some potential responses to this post could include:

* Sharing similar experiences and how they navigated similar situations
* Offering advice on how to communicate with the girl about the OP's feelings and concerns
* Discussing the importance of compromise and finding a balance between individual growth and relationship commitment
* Providing resources or tips for navigating the challenges of a long-distance relationship or taking time off from a relationship to focus on personal growth.

TITLE: Is my plan reasonable?

POST: First, thank you everybody. I lurk in this sub a decent amount. And have learned tons and gotten out of debt due to your discussions.

30 y/o. No debt of any kind. Single, no children.

Own a reliable vehicle paid off. No large property owned aside from the car.

Income $6780.84 a month before taxes, SS, Medicare, etc.
Rent & utilities is about $1200 a month.
I save $1542 every month into my emergency fund (Currently at $14,909.26).
Deposit $1458 every month into Roth TSP (Currently at $3,745.84).
Deposit $458 every month into Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund 2045 (Currently at $11,460.24).

The remainder I save in my checking account and use for food, fuel, and any other costs.

After I have $20,000 saved up for my emergency fund, I'd like to save at least $50,000 for a down payment on a home. I don't see myself purchasing a home anytime soon but would like to keep the option available by preparing for it.

The nature of my profession requires constant relocation. So I won't buy a home probably till I retire or decide I'm tired of moving every few years and change careers. Is this a good course of action? 

If yes, is there a recommended method to save that $50,000 while earning interest safely and ability to withdraw it without penalties?

If no, what other options should I consider?

Thanks again!

TL;DR: 30 y/o, no debt, single, no kids. Saving aggressively for emergency fund and retirement. Want to save $50,000 for down payment on home, but may not buy for years. Is this a good plan? How to save it safely and withdraw without penalties?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Your plan seems solid, but you might want to consider diversifying your investments. You're putting a lot of eggs in one basket with the Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund 2045. You might want to consider a more balanced portfolio or even a taxable brokerage account.
2. **u/savvy_spender**: I think your plan is great, but you might want to consider saving for a down payment on a home in a separate account. This way, you can keep the money separate from your emergency fund and retirement accounts. You can also consider using a high-yield savings account or a CD for the down payment fund.
3. **u/financialfreedom**: I love that you're thinking ahead and saving for a down payment on a home. However, you might want to consider the opportunity cost of tying up $50,000 in a savings account. You could potentially earn a higher return on investment by investing in the stock market or real estate.
4. **u/personalfinanceexpert**: Your plan is generally sound, but you might want to consider consulting with a financial advisor to get a more personalized assessment. They can help you determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
5. **u/earlyretirement**: I think your plan is great, but you might want to consider accelerating your savings rate. With your income and expenses, you could potentially save even more each month. This would allow you to reach your goals even faster.

**Conclusion:**

The OP's plan seems solid, but there are some potential areas for improvement. Diversifying investments, saving for a down payment in a separate account, considering alternative investments, and consulting with a financial advisor are all potential next steps. The community provides a range of opinions and suggestions, but ultimately, the OP's plan is well-intentioned and shows a commitment to saving and planning for the future.

TITLE: 20 (m) with a 19(f) girlfriend, need urgent help

POST: Hey guys I need some serious advice on something, my girlfriend of 6 months is losing her sex drive big time, and its really putting a damper on our relationship.

We both have talked about it numerous times but at the end of the day I can't shake the feeling that whenever we do it (1-2 times a week) its only because she knows I'll be upset if we don't.

It never used to be this way when we first started dating, and then she went on BC, which we have both discussed as a possible reason for the decline in her sex drive, but she doesn't want to go off of it and she doesn't seem to mind the lack of sex. 

What truly bothers me about all of it is that I genuinely feel like she doesn't even enjoy it anymore, and therefore the sex itself is sucking, a lot.  

All I wanna know is if laying off of initiating, (which lately has been every time were alone in my room, and getting denied like 40-50% of the time) will help, or if she will merely see it as a relief and be content with rarely ever having sex anymore. help reddit!

TL;DR: 20m with 19f girlfriend, sex drive has declined significantly, feels like she only does it because I'll be upset if we don't, and I'm worried that if I stop initiating, she'll just be content with rarely having sex.

---

**Reddit's Response:**

**Top Comment:** "Hey OP, I'm gonna give you some tough love. It sounds like you're more invested in the sex aspect of your relationship than your girlfriend is. It's not uncommon for women's sex drives to fluctuate, and it's possible that she's just not as interested in sex right now. Instead of trying to 'fix' the problem, maybe try having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Ask her what's going on and if there's anything you can do to support her. It's possible that she's going through a tough time and needs some extra attention and understanding. And honestly, if she's not interested in sex, maybe it's okay to just accept that and focus on other aspects of your relationship."

**Other Comments:**

* "OP, have you considered that maybe your girlfriend is just not that into you? Like, maybe she's not feeling the same level of attraction or intimacy that you are. It's not uncommon for relationships to go through phases where one person is more invested than the other. Instead of trying to 'fix' the problem, maybe try to focus on building a stronger emotional connection with your girlfriend."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on your girlfriend. Sex is just one aspect of a relationship, and it's not the only thing that matters. Maybe try to focus on other things you both enjoy doing together, like going on dates or trying new hobbies. And honestly, if she's not interested in sex, maybe it's okay to just accept that and move on."
* "OP, I think you're being really unfair to your girlfriend. You're basically saying that she's not doing her job as a girlfriend because she's not having sex with you as often as you want. That's not a healthy or respectful attitude to have in a relationship. Maybe try to focus on being a better partner to her, and see if that improves things."

**OP's Response:** "Thanks for the advice guys, I think I was putting too much pressure on the situation. I'll try to have a more open and honest conversation with my girlfriend about my feelings and concerns. And yeah, maybe I was being unfair to her. I'll try to focus on building a stronger emotional connection with her and see if that improves things. Thanks again for the advice!"

TITLE: My girlfriend of 2.5 years [28F] wants to have kids with me [28M] I don't. I haven't told them I've had a vasectomy.

POST: We've always used contraception (her taking the pill) but over the last three months she's forgotten taken her pill three times. She's been taking the pill ever since she was a teen, I can not conclude if they've missed it by accident or not. Since she's forgotten her first pill I've worn a condom since.

She has now finished her packet and isn't going to get a prescription so for the foreseeable future (she see's me wearing the condom as good enough, and wants a "break" from artificial hormones).

Now recently, more than usual she's been talking more about wanting to have a family. She's known since the start of our relationship that I do not wish to have one (Do I need to explain to Reddit why? Everyone usually demands an explanation). She thinks I'l change my mind about the topic in the future but I'm certain I won't.

I've never let them know I've had a vasectomy. Do I tell them? Do I keep it to myself?

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants kids, I don't. She's not taking the pill anymore and I'm wearing condoms. She's been talking more about wanting a family. Should I tell her I've had a vasectomy or keep it to myself?

---

This post is an example of a complex and sensitive situation in a relationship. The OP (original poster) is facing a dilemma about whether to reveal a personal and potentially sensitive piece of information to their girlfriend. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the girlfriend has been talking about wanting to have a family, which is a significant issue for the OP.

The OP is seeking advice from the Reddit community on whether they should tell their girlfriend about the vasectomy or keep it to themselves. The post is a good example of how relationships can be complex and require careful consideration of the potential consequences of one's actions.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "You should tell your girlfriend about the vasectomy, honesty is always the best policy in a relationship."
* "You don't have to tell her, it's your body and your decision. But you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns."
* "You should consider having a conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns, but you don't necessarily have to reveal the vasectomy. You could say something like 'I'm not comfortable with the idea of having kids' and see how she reacts."
* "You should be honest with your girlfriend, but you should also be prepared for the possibility that she may not react well to the news. You should have a plan in place for how you will handle the situation if she becomes upset or angry."

Overall, this post is a good example of how relationships can be complex and require careful consideration of the potential consequences of one's actions. It highlights the importance of honesty and open communication in relationships, and the need to consider the feelings and concerns of all parties involved.

TITLE: Should I [22f] ditch this guy [27m], or am I jumping to conclusions too quickly?

POST: We've been dating for about a month or so.

The good about him: he's taken me out to dinner, parties, breakfast, etc. He texts me nearly every day. He seems to communicate well, he's told me that he is looking for a relationship and that he likes me, etc. He told me that he doesn't like to 'hook up' with girls, that he likes to take it 'one at a time.' He said he likes being in relationships.

The bad: the last time we hung out, he seemed disinterested. I felt like I was having to carry the conversation. He didn't actually say much at all during dinner, and we just went home and passed out. One time at a party, I saw him going downstairs with a girl. I followed, and they were hanging out with a bunch of people smoking weed. It got me suspicious. He hasn't mentioned anything about us getting exclusive since we last talked about it awhile back. He seems to party a lot. He doesn't really compliment.

The thing is, I like him, but I don't want to get hurt.

Am I just being over-analytical or is this guy a douche that is just leading me on? Also, how would I tell him that I no longer want to see him? We just hung out the other night, and I acted like everything was fine and dandy. It was when I got home and thought about it that I second guessed this guy.

TL;DR: Guy seems nice, but seems disinterested, parties a lot, hasn't mentioned exclusivity, and doesn't really compliment. Am I being too harsh or is this guy a red flag?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not that into you. He's not putting in the effort to make you feel special or valued. If he's not willing to have a conversation about exclusivity, that's a major red flag. You deserve better than someone who's just going through the motions."
* "I think you're being too harsh. He's still showing interest by texting you and taking you out. Maybe he's just not as into you as you are into him. You can always have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and see where it goes."
* "I'd say ditch him. If he's not willing to put in the effort to make you feel special, he's not worth your time. You deserve someone who will make an effort to make you feel loved and valued."
* "I think you're jumping to conclusions. You've only been dating for a month, and it's normal for relationships to take time to develop. Maybe he's just not as into you as you are into him, but that doesn't mean he's a bad person. You could try having a conversation with him about your feelings and see where it goes."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate what you want in a relationship. If you're looking for someone who is going to be exclusive and make an effort to make you feel special, then maybe this guy isn't the right one for you. But if you're okay with just having a casual thing, then maybe you should give him another chance."

TITLE: Me [20/F] would like to have more 'close' friends [M and F] but I am afraid it'll be bad for my relationship with my SO [23/M] Advice?

POST: Hey everyone, 

I have been in a relationship for about three + years now. 
Short summary: Long distance relationship, will live together in a month, happy relationship, skyping a lot daily; result of that is that I have only 1 close friend (who's moving 300 kilometers away this august) and 2 friends I do not see often. Because I skype a lot and don't do sports anymore I do not have many contacts outside my SO/family. 

I miss laughing, netflix'ing and being lazy with someone (other than my SO) to socialize with. The thing is, he's kind of jealous (distance makes it hard to not go crazy sometimes) and he thinks everyone I meet (example: at work or study) is somehow into me. I do not engage into a social/more-than-colleague relationship because I do not want to cause any trouble. 

Does anyone of you have advice for me about finding a balance? Or how to make my SO accept male-friends/contacts? Make him less jealous? My relationship is very important for me and keeps me going every day. 

Sometimes I just feel like talking about the stuff going on in my head other than my SO [he knows everything anyway] and want to hear another opinion. Right now I feel like I have no one to talk to beside him.

TL;DR: Long distance relationship, happy, but struggling to find close friends outside of SO/family due to jealousy and lack of social life. Need advice on how to balance and make SO less jealous.

TITLE: I (33M) after recent breakup, don't know if I'm ready for dating again

POST: Hi everyone.

Recently my long term relationship ended, and I'm still struggling with some issues after the break up. Let me summarise:

I was in a relationship for 8 years, half of that living together, which seemed to go very nicely as we were even organising our wedding just before the break up. But important changes in life (mainly me moving to another country for a new job) ended up revealing some insecurities, lies, and finally ending the relationship due to lack of willing to go forward by my ex-partner.

This happened 6 months ago, and even if at the start it was very hard, suddenly living alone in a different country when months ago I was planning a wedding and considering having kids, I was lucky as I joined a very nice group of people at work and my old friends even if far away have helped a lot.

After the first months of missing my ex, it transitioned to just missing being with someone, and then I was able to just focus on myself, enjoying life and improving both my body and mind.

And then... I started considering looking for women and dating. The problem is that I'm not really sure that I'm really prepared for a new relationship, or if I'm looking at it because I feel alone. This was my only serious relationship, so this is unexplored territory for me. Thinking cold about it, I kinda believe that I should wait until I don't feel the need to not be alone (6 months after 8 years is not that much after all). But at the same time I think that this relationship has showed me how much a family guy I am and that I really want to share my life with someone. And being 33 I'm starting to think that I don't have that much time if I want that type of life too..

My question is, how do you know when you are ready to date again, if wanting to be in a relationship is something that you are not going to just forget?

TL;DR: I'm 33M, recently broke up after 8 years, and I'm unsure if I'm ready for dating again. I want to be in a relationship, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it because I'm lonely or if I'm truly ready. How do you know when you're ready to date again?

---

This post is a great example of a common phenomenon in the break-up subreddit: the struggle to know when it's time to start dating again. The author, a 33-year-old man, has been out of a long-term relationship for six months and is unsure if he's ready to start dating again. He's torn between his desire to be in a relationship and his fear of not being ready.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the author's situation. He's honest about his feelings and concerns, and he's seeking advice from others who may have gone through similar experiences.

The comments on this post are also very helpful and provide a range of perspectives. Some people offer words of encouragement and suggest that the author take his time and focus on himself before jumping into a new relationship. Others share their own experiences and offer advice on how to know when you're ready to date again.

Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of thoughtful and honest discussion that can be found on the break-up subreddit. It's a great resource for people who are going through a difficult time and are seeking advice and support from others who have been through similar experiences.

TITLE: My [20F] housemate [19F] is dating a guy [23M] who I found on a dating app

POST: Hey all! I'm just looking for a little advice on what to do. 

I just recently moved into a new apartment, and I get on really well with my new housemate, lets call her April. She's funny, and really easy to chill with. I'm hoping we can become good friends. 

Recently (the past 3 months) Aprils's been dating this guy, Greg, that she met on a dating app. She's been turning down other dates and claims that it would be wrong to see other men as she's so into Greg. They hang out regularly, text often and all that good stuff. 

Me, thinking that she had such good luck on the app downloaded it as well. I saw Greg. He was online and had put out a date request, but I can't tell how long ago that was posted. From what I can tell he's still looking for other people. 

The thing is, I don't know my new housemate very well. I understand her to be monogamous, but don't know their relationship dynamic. I don't want it to be weird if I say something, but I also don't want her to get played.

TL;DR: My housemate is dating a guy she met on a dating app, and I found him on the same app. I don't know what to do.

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

* "Honestly, it's not your place to say anything. You don't know the dynamics of their relationship, and it's not your business. Just focus on being a good housemate and friend to April."
* "I would talk to April about it. Be honest and open with her, but also be respectful of her relationship. You can say something like 'Hey April, I saw Greg on the app and was wondering if you knew he was still looking for dates. I don't want to be a third wheel or anything, but I wanted to give you a heads up.'"
* "I would not say anything. It's not your place to police April's relationships or warn her about someone she's already dating. If she's happy with Greg, that's all that matters. Just focus on your own life and relationships."
* "I would be honest with April, but also be prepared for her to get defensive. She might feel like you're trying to ruin her relationship or something. Just be calm and respectful, and try to have an open and honest conversation."
* "I would not say anything. It's not your place to know about April's dating life, and it's not your business. Just focus on being a good housemate and friend to April, and let her handle her own relationships."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

* It's not your place to say anything about April's relationship or warn her about Greg.
* If you do decide to talk to April, be honest and open with her, but also be respectful of her relationship.
* Focus on being a good housemate and friend to April, and let her handle her own relationships.
* Be prepared for April to get defensive if you do decide to talk to her about it. Stay calm and respectful.

TITLE: Told off my friend/boss, what to do?

POST: So I was at a party with my friend (who happens to also be my boss) and the girl I've been seeing/hooking up with. It's a pretty big party and everyone is drinking etc. My girl is acting kinda weird, flirty with other guys and generally not too attentive to me. I tell her I'm feeling tired and want to leave. I walk outside briefly and when I return she's making out with my friend/boss. Basically ended with me telling him off, to go fuck himself, that he fucked up etc and with her begging me to get in the car with her. I ended up getting dropped off by someone else altogether. They both seemed fairly sorry but I still haven't really talked to either one since. Not sure what to do, lots of mixed feelings, work is approaching on Tuesday and ill have to see him.

TL;DR: Got caught in a compromising position with my boss and his girlfriend, told him off, now unsure what to do

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you did the right thing. You didn't deserve to be treated like that and your boss didn't deserve to disrespect you like that. Don't apologize for standing up for yourself. You can't control how others behave, but you can control how you react to it."
2. **AdviceGuru**: "I would suggest taking some time to process your emotions and think about what you want to do. It's understandable that you're feeling mixed feelings, but it's important to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries. Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about what happened and how you're feeling. And when you do see your boss on Tuesday, remember that you're not obligated to apologize or make excuses for his behavior."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure I agree with the 'you did the right thing' crowd. While it's understandable that you were upset, telling your boss off in a public setting might not have been the most professional or respectful thing to do. I would suggest having a calm and rational conversation with your boss about what happened, and see if you can work through this together. Remember that your boss is still your boss, and you'll need to work with him in the future."
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm worried about the girl you've been seeing. It sounds like she was pretty reckless and irresponsible. Have you considered taking some space from her and re-evaluating whether this relationship is healthy for you? You deserve better than to be treated like that."

TITLE: I [27M] just became exclusive with [27F], how can I figure out if she likes public affection without suggesting it?

POST: I'm sure it's obvious but I'm new to relationships so excuse the question if it is something blatantly obvious. I'm neutral, but I understand people usually have a preference for whether they like to show public affection or not, eg holding hands/kissing. The girl has been making me take the lead on most things and I'd rather not do it if she isn't overly into it. I also don't want to just naturally do it in case she misunderstands that I prefer to do it.

I'm meeting her for our first date since becoming official later today. Should I perhaps just casually text her asking before we meet, or is there better way to go about it?

TL;DR: I'm unsure if my girlfriend likes public affection and don't want to assume or suggest it. How can I figure it out without being awkward or making her uncomfortable?

* "Just have an open and honest conversation with her about it. You can say something like 'Hey, I was thinking about our first date today and I was wondering if you're comfortable with public displays of affection? I want to make sure we're on the same page.'"
* "I think it's better to just go with the flow and see how she reacts. If she's not into it, she'll probably pull away or make it clear. If you're worried about it, you could always ask her after the date how she felt about it."
* "You could also try paying attention to how she interacts with you in public. Does she hold your hand or put her arm around you? If not, it might be a sign that she's not into it."
* "I think it's a bit weird to ask someone if they're comfortable with public displays of affection before doing it. Just do it and see how she reacts. If she's not into it, she'll tell you."

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my ex [25 F] 8 months. I'm really struggling with what she wants from me.

POST: Okay, so I have a lot of feelings still for my ex, not in the "HEY LETS DATE" again way just emotion I suppose, we broke up (she ended it with me) but used to get angry if I would date someone else. 

She wanted to be friends but yeah, she'd get angry and block me if I went on a date with someone and she found out. It left me in a very weird situation because I like my ex, she's a nice person and I'd prefer her to be in my life rather than completely gone.

few months ago she went out with another guy which is fine but I'm not sure why, the guy she went out with was everything she hated in a guy and I felt like she did it to kind of wind me up by letting me know what they're up to etc. 

Low and behold we had an argument as she found out I was now in a relationship with someone else and we're going great :). when my ex found out she hit the roof with stuff, refused to meet up and talk everything through like adults, wouldn't pick up the phone and eventually blocked me on Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook etc, saying don't contact her. 

So I haven't it's been over 2 months but recently she's unblocked me on these things and I'm weirded out as to why she would? I did what she told me with not contacting her, but now she's unblocked me on all these and 0 contact for that time I'm worried as to who should maybe say the first words? I want her as a friend, she's been a big part of my life and helped me through a lot of difficult times and our relationship seemed good.

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend unblocks me after 2 months of no contact, I'm unsure what she wants from me and I'm worried about saying the first words.

TITLE: She(22f) confuses me so much, I(22m) don't understand what she wants.

POST: Me and this girl have been friends for a little bit. I felt like there has been an attraction between us so I asked her if she thought so. She said she thinks there is something between us but she doesn't want to pressure it.

I asked her if her if she wanted to see where it could go, no pressure. Then she said she's doesn't know and wants to stay friends. I'm okay with that.

Now we hung out again, and she says things that seem like she wants something. Like she's implying that she wants me. For example, We were talking and i mentioned that im slighty younger then her(by 9 months) and she says, " I dont know if this is going to work out between us, i dont go for younger guys" in a flirty way.

What does she mean? I dont get it. Should i make my move next time?

TL;DR: Girl says she doesn't know if she wants to pursue a relationship, but then says things that seem like she wants me. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's playing hard to get. She's giving you mixed signals, but it's possible she's just trying to keep things interesting. If you're interested in her, you could try asking her what she means by her comments. Be direct and ask her if she's interested in pursuing something with you."
* "I think you should take her at her word when she says she doesn't know if she wants to pursue a relationship. If she's not sure, it's not fair to pressure her into something she's not ready for. You could try taking a step back and focusing on your friendship for now. If she's interested in you, she'll let you know in time."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She's just trying to have a little fun and see how you react. If you're interested in her, you could try making a move and seeing how she responds. But don't put too much pressure on it, and be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way."
* "I think you should be honest with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're interested in her and ask her if she feels the same way. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep guessing and getting mixed signals."
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your feelings for her. If you're really interested in her, you should be willing to wait for her to make up her mind. Don't pressure her into something she's not ready for, and don't get discouraged if she doesn't feel the same way."

TITLE: I [18/M] am wondering if I should ask her [18/F] again.

POST: I dated this girl and it was amazing. She was diagnosed with an apathy disorder earlier this year and...We broke up due to her wanting me not to be troubled with her mental disorder. I said to her that it won't bother me but she really wanted it as she wanted to focus on her studies and because this may be my last year she said she thought hard about it and wanted to break up.

2 Months later we talked about it and I asked her questions. She said she still had feelings for me and that over time it will go away. I confessed and told my feelings. I just wanted to know. I told her I won't bother her about it anymore but...I just can't bare to see the feelings go away over time as it is painful...

I want to get back with her but I have this conflicting feeling of not doing it due to what she said of how she does not want to. Should I atleast tell her how I feel about all this? Right now we are good friends and we enjoy each others company, but due to this complicated scenario I just can't stand the thought of us breaking up not due to incompatibility but due to how she decided that I can't handle her mental disorder.

I would love some advice.

TL;DR: I dated a girl with an apathy disorder, we broke up due to her wanting me not to be troubled with her mental disorder. We're still friends, but I still have feelings for her. Should I tell her how I feel and risk getting rejected again or just keep it to myself and enjoy our friendship?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's great that you're considering her feelings and boundaries. It's not selfish of you to want to be honest with her, but it's also important to respect her decision. If she's made it clear that she doesn't want to get back together, it might be best to just appreciate the friendship you have and not push the issue. It's okay to still have feelings, but it's also important to prioritize her well-being and comfort."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. It's possible that she's changed her mind or has new insights that could help you both move forward. However, it's also important to be prepared for the possibility that she may still not feel the same way. In that case, it might be best to accept her decision and focus on nurturing the friendship you have."
* "I think you should ask yourself why you want to get back together with her. Is it because you truly care for her and want to be with her, or is it because you're afraid of losing her? If it's the latter, then it might be best to focus on building a healthy and fulfilling life for yourself, rather than trying to cling to something that's not meant to be. On the other hand, if you truly do care for her and want to be with her, then it's worth having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings."
* "I think you should consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through your feelings and provide guidance on how to navigate this complex situation. It's also important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being, especially if you're feeling anxious or uncertain about the situation."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on your own feelings and boundaries. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What are your deal-breakers? Are you willing to compromise and work through challenges together, or are you looking for a relationship that's easy and stress-free? Once you have a better understanding of your own needs and desires, you can have a more informed conversation with her about your feelings and boundaries."

TITLE: I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life, and it stresses me out almost daily. [22 M]

POST: Pretty much what the title says. I'm about to graduate junior college. I want to start my life with my girlfriend very badly, but I just don't know what to do. All of the things I've had interest in have been deemed un-attainable by friends and family. My best friend regularly tells me not to get my dream job, but to get some office job and shoot for 3 figures. Also: I'm retarded at math, so my original major choice of Astronomer, and my computer choices thereafter are kind of a bust. I thought about being a Writer, Voice Actor, and pretty much every job in the video game industry that doesn't have anything to do with math (not many). Everyone says "Those jobs are really hard to get...you should just work at [insert soul-sucking job here], or in the Oilfields (local industry with a bunch of high-school drop outs, drug addicts and other terrible kinds of people)." Every birthday that goes by it presses down on my shoulders further. Friends complete degrees, start families, own homes, and here I am: 5th year of Junior College because I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I'm a 22-year-old male, stuck in Junior College, unsure of what to do with my life, and feeling like I'm falling behind.

COMMENTS:

* "Hey, I'm in a similar boat. I've been stuck in a dead-end job for years, and I'm 30 now. It's never too late to make a change. Have you considered taking some online courses or getting a certification in something you're interested in? It might not be a full degree, but it could give you a leg up in the job market. And honestly, it's not about the job title, it's about finding something that makes you happy and fulfilled."
* "I'm a writer, and I can tell you that it's not as easy as it seems. But if you're passionate about it, it's worth a shot. Have you considered starting a blog or writing short stories? It's a great way to get your foot in the door and build your portfolio. And who knows, maybe you'll get discovered and become a famous author"
* "I'm not a math person either, but I've learned that it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of jobs that don't require advanced math skills. Have you considered working in customer service or sales? It's not the most glamorous job, but it's a great way to build people skills and work your way up the corporate ladder. And who knows, maybe you'll find a passion for it"
* "I'm a voice actor, and I can tell you that it's a tough industry to break into. But if you're passionate about it, it's worth a shot. Have you considered taking some voice acting classes or recording yourself and sending it out to agents? It's a great way to get your foot in the door and build your portfolio. And who knows, maybe you'll get discovered and become a famous voice actor"
* "I'm not a gamer, but I've learned that it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of jobs that don't require advanced gaming skills. Have you considered working in customer service or sales? It's not the most glamorous job, but it's a great way to build people skills and work your way up the corporate ladder. And who knows, maybe you'll find a passion for it"

This post and its comments highlight the struggles of a 22-year-old male who is feeling lost and unsure of what to do with his life. He is stuck in junior college, unsure of what career path to take, and feeling pressure from friends and family to settle for a "practical" job. The comments offer words of encouragement and advice, suggesting that it's never too late to make a change, and that there are many paths to success that don't require advanced math skills or a specific degree. The comments also highlight the importance of finding a job that brings happiness and fulfillment, and that it's okay to take risks and pursue one's passions. Overall, the post and comments demonstrate the importance of self-reflection, self-advocacy, and seeking support from others when navigating life's challenges.

TITLE: [HELP][VENT]The vet told me my dog is EXTREMELY aggressive. What steps should I take?

POST: So back story about the dog, His name is lei and I adopted him from my local humane society about a month ago. He's a 4 y.o. shiba inu who, from what I have seen, is the sweetest dog. He also gets along quite well with my cat(he will sometimes bark and try to play with the cat -.-) but other than that they will lay right next to each other and go to sleep. So after having the dog for 2 weeks I thought I would bring him to the vet to turn in his papers and register him in the system. Before doing so, my dog has been around 20+ new people and I've never had any issues with aggression. (No hand biting, growling, snapping, etc) He is really shy around someone he first meets but other than that he's fine. As soon as I got to the vet my dog was clearly nervous/scared/anxious. After waiting for almost an hour to be seen I managed to calm him and have him sit next to me on a bench. Once our name was called, however, the noise from inside scared him out again.(trying to go back out and having his tail down) The lady who takes my dog is clearly irritated at the type of breed I have. She talked to me as if I knew nothing about the breed and snapped angrily about how aggressive the breed was. After waiting for the nurse to return with my dog she proceeded to tell me about how my dog is EXTREMELY people aggressive and ill have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. Then handed me 50 million pamphlets on dog trainers in my area. What should I do? What's the best course of action? Get my dog evaluated? Or go to a different vet? It' crazy because I've been going to this one my whole life and never had an issue.

TL;DR: Adopted a 4 y.o. shiba inu, brought him to the vet for registration, vet told me he's EXTREMELY aggressive and I'll have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. Never had any issues with aggression before, what should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/dogmom2015**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like the vet was completely unprofessional and biased against your breed. I would definitely get a second opinion from a different vet. Also, it's possible that your dog was just having a bad day and was overwhelmed by the noise and environment. I would also recommend working with a positive reinforcement trainer who specializes in anxiety and aggression issues. They can help you identify the root cause of the issue and work with you to address it."
2. **u/pawsitivevibes**: "I completely agree with dogmom2015. The vet's behavior was unacceptable and it's clear they didn't take the time to get to know your dog. I would also recommend getting a second opinion and working with a trainer who uses positive reinforcement methods. It's also important to remember that every dog is an individual and just because a breed is known for being aggressive, it doesn't mean your dog is going to be aggressive. You know your dog best and you should trust your instincts."
3. **u/shibainuowner**: "I'm a shiba inu owner myself and I can attest that they are not naturally aggressive dogs. It's possible that your dog was just having a bad day or was overwhelmed by the environment. I would recommend working with a trainer who specializes in shiba inus and anxiety issues. They can help you identify the root cause of the issue and work with you to address it. Also, it's important to remember that every dog is an individual and just because a breed is known for being aggressive, it doesn't mean your dog is going to be aggressive."
4. **u/animalbehaviorist**: "I'm an animal behaviorist and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for dogs to exhibit aggressive behavior in a veterinary setting. It's often due to the environment and the stress it can cause. I would recommend working with a trainer who specializes in anxiety and aggression issues and getting a second opinion from a different vet. It's also important to remember that every dog is an individual and just because a breed is known for being aggressive, it doesn't mean your dog is going to be aggressive. You know your dog best and you should trust your instincts."

TITLE: Reddit, what's your worse travel story?

POST: Several years ago, a few drinking buddies and I were driving to Virginia on vacation. After driving for nearly 16 hours straight, we stopped for dinner one night in Maryland. I forget the name of the town or the eatery, but we ate at this little cafe right on the main drag. We were too tired to realize it at the time but the place only served vegan meals. Being the incredible dumbasses that we are, we neglected to read the menu and instead ordered cheeseburgers in the hope that we could eat quick and get back to driving.

The meals come out and we scarf them down, totally oblivious to the  other patron's horror. We pay for our meal and get back on the road, intent on making our destination by morning. About an hour later, we all start to feel rumblies in our tummies.

What happened next will go down in legend.

Simultaneously, the four of us get violently ill inside my buddy's truck. Somehow, and to this day I thank him for it, he gets off to the shoulder of the road and we all sprint for ditch. For the next half hour, anyone on 95 going South could see four rednecks losing their non-vegan, vegan chef prepared meals in the most horrible way possible. It was so bad that even after we were done, none of us could eat or drink anything besides ice chips the rest of the trip

TL;DR: Four friends ate vegan meals at a cafe in Maryland, didn't realize it until it was too late, and then got violently ill on the side of the road.

COMMENTS:

* "I'm dying over here. I've had some bad food experiences, but this takes the cake. I hope you guys learned your lesson and now always read the menu"
* "I'm laughing so hard I'm crying. I can only imagine the looks on your faces when you realized what was happening"
* "I've had a similar experience, but it was with gluten-free food. Let's just say it was a long night"
* "I'm glad you guys learned your lesson, but also, what kind of sickos would serve vegan cheeseburgers? "
* "I'm a vegan and I'm cringing so hard. I'm glad you guys learned your lesson, but also, please don't judge all vegans by your experience"
* "I'm dying over here. I hope you guys got a good laugh out of it, because that's the only way to get through something like that"

This post is a great example of a Reddit post that has gained a lot of attention and engagement. The story is relatable, humorous, and entertaining, which is why it has received so many comments and upvotes. The post also sparks a lot of conversation and debate, with some people sharing their own similar experiences and others offering advice and words of caution. Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be a platform for people to share their stories and connect with others.

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my [24 F] hopefully more than one date

POST: Recently, I met someone from an smartphone dating app (not tinder, but similar). We talked for a few days and realized we had a lot of similar interests so we decided to meet up yesterday. We both had a great afternoon and she's someone I'd really like to get closer with. Only problem is she lives 60 miles away, so close enough for a day trip but a little too far just to go for dinner or something like that. I dont live in a major city either and 60 miles is a few counties over.

My question is how can I get to the next level with her despite living an hour away? I dont mind driving but at this point we're still getting to know each other and have to be doing some kind of planned activity to feel comfortable, which is difficult to coordinate when you dont live in the same place and are two busy people.

Any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: Met someone from a dating app, had a great time, but we live 60 miles apart. How can I get to the next level with her despite the distance?

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to make this work. Have you considered meeting in the middle? Maybe find a neutral location that's halfway between your two homes? That way you can still spend time together without having to worry about the distance."
* "I'd suggest planning a weekend getaway or a mini-road trip to her place. That way you can spend some quality time together and get to know each other better. You could also consider planning a fun activity or outing in her area, like a hike or a visit to a local attraction."
* "I think it's great that you're being proactive and wanting to make this work. Have you considered video calls or phone calls to keep in touch and get to know each other better? That way you can still spend time together even if you can't be in the same physical location."
* "I'd suggest being open and honest with her about your concerns and see how she feels about it. Maybe she's willing to make the effort to come see you or meet you halfway. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when there are distance challenges."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about the logistics of your relationship. Have you considered planning a visit to her place and then she can come visit you? That way you can both get to know each other's homes and communities. Just make sure to communicate and plan ahead to make sure it works for both of you."

TITLE: TIFU by helping my dad split logs

POST: 2 years ago hurricane sandy came through, and we actually made out pretty well. A fucking massive tree did fall on my house, but it hit another tree on the way down, and that kinda softened the blow. In any case, after a lot of other stories, we got the tree off the house.

My family is pretty good at making the best of things, and we thought "well, now we have a few thousand pounds of firewood!". We have a fireplace that we like to use.

You can't use the logs right away because they have to dry out. I honestly don't remember if we split any last year, but even this year we have plenty left. So, I figured I'd be a good sport and help out, and split some logs.

My dad was in an accident recently, and broke his wrist, so wielding an axe isn't exactly something that's very comfortable for him. Another incentive for me to help out. It's at this point that I should note- He got a brand new handle for the axe about 2 weeks ago.

I grab the axe (actually a maul but whatever) and the sledge, and he gives me some pointers. I hit like 4 logs off center, and make real crappy attempts. At this point I'm feeling like I'm not helping much, but he's cool about it.

On the 5th or 6th log I over swing, and BAM I bust the head clean off the handle. I casually tossed the handle down, looked at my dad, and said "well, looks like I owe you a handle." I felt pretty damn bad.

Fortunately he was cool about it, and said that's part of learning.

TL;DR: I helped my dad split logs, and in the process, I broke the handle off the axe. I felt bad, but he was cool about it.

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/tifu, which stands for "Today I F**ked Up." The post is a humorous account of a situation where the author, a young man, helps his dad split logs for firewood, but ends up breaking the handle off the axe.

TITLE: Reddit, what's your most regrettable "Socially Awkward Penguin" moment?

POST: So I was visiting San Francisco for the weekend, and I sort of got sucked into attending a "Florence + Machine" concert. I wasn't too excited to be spending my Friday night there but I dealt with it. We were in the assigned seating section and I was glad to see that my seat was next to a very cute blonde gal. After a few minutes, this girl giving me signs that she might be interested in me. As the night went on, these signs became more and more obvious and I wanted to strike up a conversation so badly...but instead I sat there awkwardly the entire night, too afraid to even look in her direction. At one point I thought that if I consumed some alcohol I would think of something great to start the conversation with, but I ended up acting becoming even more awkward. The reason I regret this is because now that I'm back home from California, I have absolutely no way of knowing who she was, where she was from, or if she was actually interested. Plus I'll never be able to explain why I was such an awkward asshole! 

I have to finish with saying that I work in a job that requires me to constantly socialize with people so I have no idea what the hell happened to me to make me freeze.

TL;DR: I attended a concert, sat next to a cute girl, and was too afraid to talk to her. Now I'm left wondering what could've been.

TITLE: Do my (F25) parents need to meet my SO's (M27) parents?

POST: So my SO's mother lives over 5 hours away from us and my family. She is coming to visit and has made a point of saying how she expects that she will be invited for a dinner or something with my parents.

We have been living together for close to a year, probably going to get married, though I'm not really sure yet. 

I would prefer to wait until we decide to get engaged for this meeting to happen because his mom is bat-shit crazy and talks endlessly about random shit like stories about people we do not know and never will know. 

At the same time she makes no effort to get to know us. She says that "she loves me as her own family" yet really knows nothing about me because on the occasions when we go to visit she doesn't let me get a word in and doesn't seem to want to talk about anything of relevance.

I know my parents' personalities wont jive with her personality, and worry that them getting together is a shit-show waiting to happen. Add this to the fact that I'm not 100% sure on whether I want to marry this guy, I just don't think I should be forced to set up an awkward meeting between my parents and his mother.

We did have a discussion about it before, but he ended up just getting frustrated and dropping it so as to not jeopardize our relationship. But I still feel he is resentful about this and I'm sure it will come up closer to the time when his mother is going to visit.

Am I being fair? How can I explain this to my SO without coming off as being stubborn?

TL;DR: SO's mom is coming to visit, wants to meet my parents, but I'm worried it will be awkward and I'm not sure about marrying him yet. How can I explain this to him without coming off as stubborn?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not being unfair at all. You have every right to set boundaries and prioritize your own comfort and sanity. It's not about being stubborn, it's about being realistic about the potential outcome of this meeting. You should have an open and honest conversation with your SO about your concerns and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I think you're being reasonable. It's not like you're asking him to choose between his mom and you, you're just asking for some consideration and understanding. You should express your concerns and see if he's willing to work with you to find a solution that makes everyone comfortable."
* "I would suggest having a calm and rational conversation with your SO about your concerns. Explain to him how you feel and why you're worried about the meeting. Try to focus on the potential outcomes and how they might affect your relationship. It's possible that he's not aware of his mom's behavior and might be willing to work with you to find a solution."
* "You're not being unfair, but you do need to consider the bigger picture. If you're not sure about marrying him, then maybe this meeting is an opportunity to get a better sense of his family dynamics and whether you're compatible in the long term. Just be honest with yourself and your SO about your concerns and see where the conversation takes you."
* "I think you should prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in this situation. If you're not comfortable with the meeting, then it's okay to say no. You don't have to justify or explain yourself to anyone. Your SO should respect your boundaries and understand that you're not being stubborn, you're just being honest about your feelings."

TITLE: My [36/F] coworker [late 20's/M] who inappropriately hit on me just asked me to write him a letter of recommendation

POST: I am in a very happy relationship and a guy I work with flirted with me a few months back.  He said that he found me "stunning," but he said it in a casual way in the middle of a conversation when we were consulting about something else that was fairly serious.  I was very uncomfortable with it and told my boyfriend about it, which then made him uncomfortable.  He said I did nothing wrong, which I agree with, and since then I've tried to avoid the co-worker as much as possible.

Also since then, it came out that he hooked up with a colleague at work and then treated her poorly, causing her to be so upset she quit the job.  I have noticed many many more ways that he is inappropriate, has horrible boundaries and moreso just has huge issues.  We work in the mental health field and I have a higher position and degree than him so it REALLY bothers me to see how he acts.

Today he asked if I would write a letter of recommendation for him to go to counseling school.  I personally think he could be a good clinician, if he had more training, so I think it's a great idea for him to learn boundaries, ethics, theories, etc.  However, I feel really weird about writing him a letter of recommendation, mainly because my boyfriend was uncomfortable with him flirting with me, and also because I don't think he has good judgement at the moment, but he could eventually have it with the proper training.  I'm a people pleaser so in the moment I said yes.  But now I feel awkward, what do I do?

TL;DR: Coworker who inappropriately hit on me and has poor boundaries asked me to write a letter of recommendation for counseling school. I'm torn between doing it because I think he could be a good clinician with training, but also because my boyfriend was uncomfortable with the flirting and I don't think he has good judgement at the moment.

---

**Comments:**

* "I would say no. You don't owe him a letter of recommendation just because he asked. You have every right to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. If he's not willing to respect your boundaries, why should you enable him by writing a letter that could potentially help him get into a program?"
* "I agree with the above comment. You don't have to do it. But if you do decide to write the letter, make it clear that you're doing it because you think he has potential as a clinician, not because you're trying to help him get into a program. You can say something like 'I believe [coworker] has the potential to be a great clinician, but he needs to work on his boundaries and ethics before he can be effective in the field.'"
* "I think you should write the letter, but with conditions. You could say something like 'I'm willing to write a letter of recommendation for you, but only if you agree to work on your boundaries and ethics before you start your program.' This way, you're holding him accountable for his behavior and giving him the opportunity to grow and change."
* "I'm a bit surprised that you're considering writing a letter of recommendation for someone who has poor boundaries and has treated a colleague poorly. Don't you think that's enabling his behavior? Maybe you should focus on supporting people who have good boundaries and treat others with respect and kindness."
* "I think you should talk to your boyfriend about this and get his input. He's been uncomfortable with your coworker's behavior, and you should respect his feelings. Maybe you can come up with a joint decision together about whether or not to write the letter."

TITLE: I've [21/M] been dating this girl [21/F] for three weeks and I'm not sure if we're moving too fast.

POST: We both have amazing chemistry and it seems we're almost always on the same page. We're both pretty infatuated with each other. Never before had I had the urge to text a girl almost daily (and I'm known as a horrible texter), see a girl often or really get to know them.

We both have never been in a relationship before and are typically scared of commitment. I mentioned last week that I felt we were moving too fast and we should take it slow. I told her I don't want to hurt her if we don't work out and she said she's strong if it happens, and that she said we'll see where time takes us. 

We had one drunken talk this past weekend and admitted our feelings to each other. I said I was falling in love with her and she said she really liked me. At one point in the conversation, she almost said I love you...but stopped. She started getting emotional and started crying and I wasn't sure if it was out of happiness and/or sadness. She said she never gone this far with a guy and I mentioned the same. I said for us to be monogamous but not official to determine if our feelings are real and not circumstantial. 

At these times when I talk about the state of our relationship, I feel like she always agree with what I say and doesn't give any dissent. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. 

I'm probably being an asshole right now. I feel like I'm trying to fight the feeling of falling in love/being in love because I've never felt these feelings before and things are going too smoothly to be true.

TL;DR: I'm 21, dating a girl for three weeks, and I'm unsure if we're moving too fast. We have amazing chemistry, but I'm scared of commitment. She says she's strong if it doesn't work out, but I'm worried she's not giving me any dissent when I express my concerns.

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're being paranoid. It sounds like you're just trying to slow down the pace because you're not used to feeling this way. Give her some credit, she's probably just as scared as you are. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. If she's really into you, she'll understand where you're coming from."
2. **SkepticalSally**: "I agree with throwaway123456. You're probably just trying to slow down the pace because you're not used to feeling this way.

Have a conversation with her about your concerns, but also be open to hearing her perspective. Remember, relationships are about compromise and communication."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I'm in a similar situation right now, and I can totally relate. I think you're being a bit too cautious. It's okay to take things slow, but you also need to be willing to take risks and be vulnerable. If you're really feeling this way, then maybe you should just go with it and see where it takes you. Just make sure you're communicating with her and being honest about your feelings."
4. **CautiousCouple**: "I think you're being smart to slow down the pace. It's easy to get caught up in the romance and excitement of a new relationship, but you need to make sure you're both on the same page. Have a conversation with her about your concerns and see how she feels. If she's really into you, she'll understand where you're coming from. Just remember, relationships are about compromise and communication."

TITLE: Me (26m) have had a falling out with a good friend (25f), but I need to tell her something.

POST: Hello everyone, first off, sorry for the vague title, I suck at titles apparently, let's hope I don't suck at typing the rest ;)

Obligatory mobile/non native sentence.

Long story short, I have/had a very good friend (25f), we had a very good bond but for the past few weeks we had a falling out. 

The problem however is that she is in a bad situation with someone else, her dancing teacher, whom she had an argument with. 
I know her teacher personally as well, so I know every detail of the situation since a few days (before that I wasn't really digging into their problem but it came up in a conversation).

Now the thing is, I know what to say to both of them so that they can resolve their problem, something I know will make my friend a lot happier. 

However, I know she won't like me (or anyone for that matter) interfering with her life and chances are she won't react positive towards me nomatter the outcome.

So what do you guys think I should do?

Option A is I keep completely out of it, nothing changes.

Option B is I do what is necessary for them to fix their problem.

Honestly I care more for her being happy (dancing is a BIG thing for her) then her being pissed at me, hell, I'd see it as an heroic sacrifice, she'll hate me but her she can go back and do something she loves.

So I'm leaning towards B, get myself involved, fix this for her, nomatter the fallout. 

So people, advice please, are you going to talk me into it or out of it?

Cheers!

TL;DR: Had a falling out with a good friend, know how to fix a problem between her and her dancing teacher, but know she won't like me interfering. Should I keep out of it or try to fix it for her happiness?

**Comment 1:**
I think you should keep out of it. Even if you think you're doing it for her happiness, it's still your decision to make and it's not your problem to solve. If she's in a bad situation, it's up to her to decide what to do about it. You can't fix everything for her, and by trying to, you might actually make things worse. Just be there for her as a friend and let her know you're there for her, but don't try to fix everything.

**Comment 2:**
I think you should talk to your friend and explain the situation to her. Let her know that you know what's going on and that you're willing to help her work through it. She might appreciate your input and support, and it could actually bring you two closer together. Just be careful not to come across as judgmental or trying to tell her what to do.

TITLE: What's the whole 'WakeUpNow' business opportunity and how legitimate is it?

POST: Recently a couple of people I know started promoting this business called 'WakeUpNow'. They were explaining to me how they are this business that offers discounts on travel, groceries, and many other expenses, and it is an opportunity for you to make money by marketing their business. I was told that the system works by getting a certain number of friends & family to'sign up' with this business, and then when you have enough people under you then you can start earning $600 to $10k a month, just by solely marketing the business & signing people up, and supposedly they offer you take vacations at huge discounts, just by "taking a picture of the receipt and posting on a social media website and claim 'in a business meeting', and then the company reimburses you". Now doing some research, some people say they are a scam and don't do it, others say it is a legit business and not a pyramid scheme.

I'm looking for legitimate answers. Is it pyramid scheme? How does this company generate money? Anyone on Reddit have experience (good or bad) with this company. **I am not interested in this company**, I'm just digging for details on what this company is about?

TL;DR: WakeUpNow business opportunity, is it legit or a pyramid scheme? How does it generate money? Anyone have experience with this company?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **legitbutnotgreat**: WakeUpNow is a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that sells travel and lifestyle products. They claim to offer discounts on travel, groceries, and other expenses, but the real money is made by recruiting new members and selling their products. The company generates revenue through the sale of these products, as well as through the recruitment fees paid by new members. However, the company has been criticized for its high-pressure sales tactics and lack of transparency in its business practices.

2. **skeptical_sam**: WakeUpNow is a pyramid scheme. The company's business model is based on recruiting new members and selling them products, rather than selling products to end-users. The company's revenue is generated primarily through the recruitment fees paid by new members, rather than through the sale of products. This is a classic sign of a pyramid scheme.

3. **experienced_examiner**: I've done some research on WakeUpNow and it appears to be a legitimate business, but it's not without its flaws. The company's products and services are not particularly unique or innovative, and the company's business model is heavily reliant on recruiting new members. Additionally, the company's compensation plan is complex and may be difficult for some people to understand.

4. **red_pill_reality**: WakeUpNow is a classic example of a pyramid scheme. The company's business model is based on recruiting new members and selling them products, rather than selling products to end-users. The company's revenue is generated primarily through the recruitment fees paid by new members, rather than through the sale of products. This is a classic sign of a pyramid scheme.

5. **cautious_consumer**: I've done some research on WakeUpNow and it appears to be a legitimate business, but I would approach it with caution. The company's products and services are not particularly unique or innovative, and the company's business model is heavily reliant on recruiting new members. Additionally, the company's compensation plan is complex and may be difficult for some people to understand.

**Conclusion:** The top comments on this post provide a range of opinions on the legitimacy of WakeUpNow. Some commenters believe that the company is a pyramid scheme, while others believe that it is a legitimate business. The company's business model is based on recruiting new members and selling them products, rather than selling products to end-users.

TITLE: [21 M/F] Just Started Seeing This Girl and Her Ex Is Threatening to Hill Himself

POST: Met a great girl last week, we've been clicking so fast and I know that we have something great going for us. We went out on our first date and she explained to me her situation with her ex, which had me in awe and I did not really know what to tell her.

She was about to break up with her ex when I think he started to sense she was going to. They were staying in a hotel for the weekend, and he threatened to kill himself by jumping off a balcony. When she tried to restrain him he threw her away where she ended up going through a glass table. To add fuel to the fire he began telling people she raped him on the trip and he doesn't trust her anymore.

The worst part is he texts her just about everyday and she is clueless on how to handle it. She doesn't want to feel responsible if she does end up killing herself, and she complies to talk to him just to avoid this. She assured me there are no feelings at all, but she does it because she couldn't live with herself.

I literally had no idea how to respond. I told her I was glad she was sharing this with me, but I really don't know how the handle the situation. Usually when people say they're going to kill themselves over a girlfriend, it's just to find a little glimmer of hope and to hold on to something that is not there. This girl has a huge heart and I think she really doesn't want to feel that guilt.

How do I go about helping her out in this situation? It seems really tricky and I don't want to get in the middle, but I really like this girl and he needs to back the fuck off.

TL;DR: Girl's ex is threatening to kill himself over her and she's torn between feeling responsible and not wanting to talk to him. I'm at a loss on how to help her.

---

**Comments:**

* "This is a really tough situation. I think the first step is to encourage her to seek professional help, such as a therapist or counselor. They can help her work through her feelings and develop a plan to deal with her ex's behavior."
* "I would suggest that she block his number and any other means of contact. If he's not getting a response from her, he may eventually lose interest and move on."
* "It's great that you're concerned about her well-being, but you can't fix this situation on your own. Encourage her to seek help and support from people who are trained to deal with these kinds of situations."
* "I think it's important to recognize that her ex's behavior is not her fault. She didn't do anything to deserve this kind of treatment, and she shouldn't feel guilty or responsible for his actions."
* "It's also important to remember that people who make threats of self-harm or suicide are often trying to manipulate others and gain attention. It's not a genuine cry for help, and it's not something that should be taken lightly."
* "I would suggest that she document all of the threatening messages and interactions she has with her ex. This can be used as evidence if she needs to take legal action or seek a restraining order."
* "It's great that you're supporting her and trying to help her through this difficult time. Just remember that you can't fix everything, and sometimes the best thing you can do is just be there for her and offer emotional support."

TITLE: I[22/F] suspect my guy-friend[24/M] who wants to sleep with me is still taken and using me to sleep around with

POST: My friend 'Sean' and I have known each other for a little over three years. We're fairly good friends, but somewhat fell out of contact a while ago when he graduated from our university. We share a pretty large friend group, though, and they usually know how he's doing and trying to invite him to our outings. Through the group I knew that Sean was dating 'Maggie', a younger girl(19) from out of town. 

But last April, Sean contacted me out of the blue and started striking up conversations over messenger, ostensibly to seehow I was. I enjoyed talking to him again after a few months of no contact, and soon after our conversations started he told me he had been thinking about me and wanted to sleep together at some point. I asked if he was still with Maggie, and he said he had broken up with her the past month.

We continued to banter the following months, and eventually scheduled our first 'date' for this upcoming Saturday. I was pretty excited, and was hanging out with some of the guys from our friend group today. Sean's best friend, 'Matthew', didn't seem to know that Sean and I were seeing each other, which struck me as weird since Sean tells Matthew everything. Later that day, Matthew also offhandedly mention that he had been hanging out with "Sean and his girlfriend" last weekend.

I'm not sure if it's a misunderstanding or if I'm overreacting, but I'm worried that Sean may still be seeing Maggie and trying to sleep with me behind her back. I had a big crush on him a year or so ago(which he knew about and did not return at the time), and I'm worried he might just be trying to take advantage of me and my feelings. How do I broach this subject with him without sounding accusatory?

TL;DR: Guy-friend who wants to sleep with me claims to have broken up with his girlfriend, but his best friend mentions he saw him with his 'girlfriend' last weekend. I'm worried he might still be taken and using me to sleep around.

The post also includes a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) section, which is a great way to provide a quick summary of the post for readers who may not want to read the entire thing.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to share a personal and potentially sensitive situation on Reddit, and how to seek advice and support from the community.

TITLE: Spanish/English speakers of Reddit. What are good resources/tools to help a 20 year old Spanish speaker learn basic English?

POST: I am working with the Migrant Education program in New Hampshire. This boy is 20 years old, a Spanish speaker, and knows very little English. He wants to learn basic vocabulary in English. So far I have been looking for podcasts to put on his Ipod to listen to while he works. However, most of these podcasts are too advanced. He has also expressed interest in watching movies in English with Spanish subtitles, but most of these movies move too fast for him. I am trying to find something that moves slower without being at a child's interest level. His English is EXTREMELY limited. What tools/tricks do you suggest?

TL;DR: 20 year old Spanish speaker wants to learn basic English. Looking for resources and tools to help him learn vocabulary and understand English. Podcasts and movies with Spanish subtitles are too advanced. Need something slower paced but not too childish.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/EnglishTeacher**: "I think Duolingo is a great resource for beginners. It's a free language learning app that's designed for beginners and has a gentle learning curve. It's also gamified, so it can be fun and engaging. You can also try watching English TV shows with Spanish subtitles on Netflix or YouTube. There are many shows that are designed for language learners, like 'Easy English' or 'EnglishClass101'."
2. **u/LanguageLearner**: "I'm a language learner myself, and I can attest that Duolingo is an excellent resource. I also recommend using flashcards to learn new vocabulary. You can make physical flashcards or use apps like Anki. Another great resource is 'English Central', which is a video-based language learning platform that provides subtitles, audio, and exercises to help learners improve their listening and speaking skills."
3. **u/TeacherTina**: "I've worked with many students who are learning English as a second language, and I've found that using real-life materials like news articles, recipes, and instructions can be really helpful. You can also try using songs with lyrics and translations to help him learn new vocabulary. Additionally, consider using a language exchange website like italki, where he can practice speaking with a native English speaker."
4. **u/EnglishMajor**: "I think it's great that you're trying to help him learn English! One thing that might be helpful is to focus on functional language, like phrases and sentences that he can use in everyday situations. You can also try using visual aids like pictures or videos to help him learn new vocabulary. Another great resource is 'EnglishClub', which is a website that offers language lessons, exercises, and games for learners of all levels."

**Other Comments:**

* **u/EnglishStudent**: "I'm an English student myself, and I can attest that Duolingo is an excellent resource. I also recommend using podcasts like '60-Second Science' or 'Coffee Break English', which are designed for language learners and have a slow pace."
* **u/LanguageLearner**: "I think it's great that you're trying to help him learn English! One thing that might be helpful is to focus on grammar and sentence structure. You can also try using language learning apps like Babbel or Rosetta Stone."
* **u/TeacherTina**: "I've worked with many students who are learning English as a second language, and I've found that using real-life materials like news articles, recipes, and instructions can be really helpful. You can also try using songs with lyrics and translations to help him learn new vocabulary."
* **u/EnglishMajor**: "I think it's great that you're trying to help him learn English! One thing that might be helpful is to focus on functional language, like phrases and sentences that he can use in everyday situations. You can also try using visual aids like pictures or videos to help him learn new vocabulary."

TITLE: My girlfriend[22F] told me[22M] "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?"... We have been together for almost 3 years.

POST: I've heard that phrase 2 or 3 times and I've had enough. Sometimes I feel like she wants ME to end the relationship for whatever reason. After a small argument we had, it went something like this.

Her: "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?"

Me: "Because I love you? Are you telling me that you want this to end?"

Her: "No" 

Me: "So why did you bring that up?"

Her: "I love you so much and it's not like I want to solve this by breaking up, but I don't want to hurt you"

She's very sweet and she always tells me how "happy" she is with me, our sex life is great (she lost her virginity with me), we always have a great time when we are together, etc... Most of our problems are caused by lack of communication or misunderstandings.

Lately I've had a "feeling" that shes hiding something from me, she's "acting" normal, but I just have that strange feeling that something is not "right", for example, a few days ago she went out with her sister (that's what she told me, honestly I'm not sure) to do some errands, she was SO reserved when she was explaining me what she was doing, where she was and why she didn't replied to my messages... Some stuff seemed a little bit "suspicious".

When she goes out with her sister (or her mom) she always messages me "We are almost home", but that day she wrote "I'm almost home", implying she was alone. Maybe I'm just f****** crazy. We live like 3 hours away so we only see each other like once per week.

TL;DR: My girlfriend told me "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?" and I feel like she's hinting that she wants me to end the relationship. I've had a feeling that she's hiding something from me lately. What should I do?

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's trying to guilt trip you into ending the relationship. She's not directly saying it, but she's making you feel like you're not good enough for her because you get angry/sad sometimes. You deserve better than that. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how her words make you feel."
* "I think you're overthinking things. She's probably just having a bad day or feeling overwhelmed. The 'I'm almost home' thing might be a mistake, but it's not necessarily a sign of anything suspicious. Try to talk to her about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."
* "I've been in a similar situation before. It's not just about the words she's saying, it's about the tone and the context. If she's saying it in a way that's making you feel bad about yourself, that's not okay. You need to have a conversation with her about how her words are affecting you and see if you can find a way to communicate better."
* "I think you should take a step back and evaluate the relationship as a whole. Are there other signs that things are off? Are you feeling happy and fulfilled in the relationship? If not, maybe it's time to reevaluate whether this is the right relationship for you."
* "I think you're being paranoid. She's probably just having a bad day and didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Try to talk to her about it and see if you can work through it together. Don't jump to conclusions and assume the worst."



**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thanks for the comments, guys. I think I'm going to try to talk to her about it and see how she feels. I don't want to assume the worst, but I do want to clear the air and make sure we're on the same page. I'll keep you updated on how it goes."



**Follow-up Post:**

* "Update: I talked to her about it and she said she was just feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. She didn't mean to hurt my feelings and she loves me. We had a good conversation and we're going to work on communicating better. Thanks for the advice, guys!"



**Additional Comments:**

* "Glad to hear that you were able to talk it out and clear the air! Communication is key in any relationship. Keep working on it and you'll be golden."
* "I'm glad you were able to have a good conversation and work through it. Remember to keep an eye out for any red flags in the future, but it sounds like you two are on the right track."
* "I'm glad you were able to talk it out and clear the air! Remember to always communicate openly and honestly with your partner. It's okay to have disagreements, but it's how you work through them that matters."



**Conclusion:**

The original poster's girlfriend told him that he should end the relationship because she makes him feel angry and sad. The poster felt like she was hinting that she wanted him to end the relationship, and he was worried that she was hiding something from him. After talking to her, she explained that she was just feeling overwhelmed and stressed out, and she didn't mean to hurt his feelings. The poster and his girlfriend had a good conversation and are working on communicating better. The comments on the post were supportive and offered advice on how to navigate the situation. The follow-up post showed that the couple was able to work through their issues and come out stronger on the other side.

TITLE: "Give the goat head"?

POST: A coworker of mine said, "I'll run some preliminary tests first before I give you the goat head" over AIM. 

Should I have corrected him? If so, how should I have responded?

I'm asking reddit because there are a lot of people who have (strong) opinions on grammar nazis and when to behave like one. 

My opinion is that so long as the main message is conveyed well enough, I don't say a word. (For example, everyone knows what a grammar nazi is. Should I have taken the time to find out whether "grammer" and/or "nazi" should be capitalized? I don't think so.) But I also wouldn't mind if someone corrected me. It's kind of for my own edification, and I think it improves how well I can express myself with words.

So, in the case with my convo with my coworker, I didn't say anything because I knew what he meant. But I also thought, "What if he uses that phrase incorrectly again? What if someone corrects him later and he thinks that I don't know the correct usage because I didn't say anything?" I might be thinking about this too much. 

Anyway, what would you have done?

TL;DR: Coworker said "I'll run some preliminary tests first before I give you the goat head" over AIM. Should I have corrected him? If so, how?

**Top comments:**

* "I think you should have let it slide. It's not a big deal and it's not like he's trying to be intentionally unclear. If someone corrects him later, that's their prerogative, not yours." (123 upvotes)
* "I would have corrected him. It's a weird phrase and it's not every day you hear someone say 'goat head'. It's a good opportunity to clarify what they mean and make sure everyone is on the same page." (56 upvotes)
* "I think it's a good idea to correct him, but not in a condescending way. You could say something like 'Hey, just to clarify, what do you mean by 'goat head'? Is it a specific file or something?' That way you're showing that you're interested in understanding what they mean, rather than trying to correct them for the sake of correcting them." (34 upvotes)
* "I would have let it slide, but I would have also made a mental note to ask him what he means by 'goat head' later. It's always good to clarify these kinds of things, especially if you're not sure what someone means." (23 upvotes)

**Original poster's response:**

Thanks for the feedback, everyone! I think I'm going to take the approach of letting it slide, but also making a mental note to ask him what he means by 'goat head' later. I don't want to come across as a grammar nazi, but I also want to make sure I understand what he's trying to communicate. I'll try to approach it in a friendly and non-confrontational way. Thanks again for your input! (14 upvotes)

TITLE: I [23F] was seeing a guy [26M] for about 2 weeks. I think he took nudes of me, and may have shared them.

POST: Ok. So I was hooking up with a cowoker (I know, horrible idea) for about two weeks back in August before I broke things off. There were several red flags: 

1) I told me he "loved" me after about three days.

2) He didn't understand the word no, and I had to either yell at him to stop trying to have sex with me or physically leave the room for him to get the message (made even worse by the fact that I, myself, have been raped and he was aware of this.

3) There were two/three incidents when I was in bed, naked, mostly asleep, he had his phone out and pointed towards me. 

4) When I tried to end things, he grabbed my wrists really freakin' hard and pulled me towards him while yelling "NO!", and that I couldn't break up with him because he loves me (I'm 133, he was like 200? of solid muscle). Super scary.

Now, I don't know for sure if he actually took any photos of me. But he recently switched to working the night shift, where I work middle shift - so I do still have some interaction with the night shift people. Since he started working nights, people at work have started treating me differently. 

So, I don't know what to do. The last time I saw him at work, I said we needed to talk, but was running late for the bus, so I had to go. I gave it two days and then texted him about it. No response. Any advice? I am partially hesitant to see him one-on-one as he did scare me a lot...but I feel like I have to know what's going on and if he took any pictures of me.

TL;DR: I was seeing a guy for 2 weeks, and I think he may have taken nudes of me. He's been treating me differently at work since he started working nights, and I'm scared. I don't know what to do or how to approach this situation.

**Edit:** I've been getting some great advice from you all, and I wanted to add a few more details. 

1) I do have a copy of our conversation from the night we broke up, where he said he loved me and I told him I didn't feel the same way. He also said he was going to "make me see" that he loved me. 

2) I've been trying to keep a low profile at work, but it's hard when people are treating me differently. 

3) I've been thinking about reporting him to HR, but I'm not sure if that's the right step. 

4) I've been trying to talk to friends and family about this, but it's hard for them to understand what's going on. 

5) I've been feeling really anxious and scared, and I'm not sure how to deal with these feelings. 

**Edit 2:** I just wanted to add that I've been thinking about getting a restraining order, but I'm not sure if that's the right step. I've also been thinking about talking to a lawyer, but I'm not sure if that's the right step either. I just want to know what my options are and what I can do to protect myself.

TITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend[26 M] of almost 2 years, live with his parents, we're trying to get healthy. How do I get his mother to understand this?

POST: So my boyfriend and I stay with his parents, and we are both constantly on the go. We are saving to buy our own place and we live in Hawaii so it is very expensive here. So, just moving out isn't an option. 

He and I are trying to eat healthier (his parents say they are too) but when I cook, I need to cook enough for everyone in the house rather than just the 2 of us. That would mean 6 of us total. 

His mom does the grocery shopping and we do some as well. I am getting so sick of her buying crap food. She buys only cheap and processed food and if I don't cook then they eat crap when I'm not there or if I don't cook. I could do all the grocery shopping but thats expensive for a family of 6. She says she wants to eat healthy but all she buys is crap. Spam, vienna sausages, ground beef, cream of mushroom, and other things.  NEVER buys fruit and when she does, it goes bad because she doesnt cut. it only gets cut if my boyfriend or myself cut it. She'll buy vegetable here and there but rarely because she says they go bad to fast, but thats because she's always trying to make junk food.

 And for meal prepping, thats impossible in that house. If you have food in there, and someone wants to eat, there it goes! I can deal with this but its mainly the buying groceries and cooking. I don't know what to do with this woman. I understand she gets home late from work and just wants to throw stuff together but shes going about this wrong. What do i do?

TL;DR: I'm living with my boyfriend's parents, we're trying to eat healthier, but his mom keeps buying cheap and processed food. I'm tired of cooking for everyone and dealing with the mess. How do I get her to understand that we want to eat healthy?

This post is a great example of a common problem in relationships: conflicting values and habits between partners and their families. The OP (original poster) is frustrated with her boyfriend's mother's unhealthy food choices and the lack of support for their own healthy eating goals.

The OP is seeking advice on how to approach the situation and get his mother to understand their desire to eat healthier. She's looking for suggestions on how to communicate effectively with her boyfriend's mother and find a solution that works for everyone.

TITLE: Reddit, I got yelled at for standing up at a concert while the people behind me wanted to sit. Am I the asshole?

POST: I was at a concert this weekend supporting my favorite artist. Most of the amphitheater was standing, however *some* people in my section were not (including some people behind me and to my right). All of a sudden at the end of the set I got basically shoved in the back and told to sit down. I told them absolutely not, I want to support my favorite artist (who kept saying STAND UP, btw). I paid over $100 for these seats and I want to have a great time.. after all this IS a concert. Not to mention, I heard them calling me names before they confronted me so now I was certainly not going to sit down. Then a few songs later the woman sitting next to me told me what a bitch I was for not letting the people behind me see. Was I in the wrong here?

TL;DR: Got yelled at for standing up at a concert, people behind me wanted to sit. Paid for seats, want to have a good time. Am I the asshole?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're not the asshole. You paid for those seats and you're allowed to enjoy the concert however you want. If the people behind you wanted to sit, they should've gotten seats in a different section. You're not responsible for their viewing experience."
2. **u/throwaway7890**: "I'm with you on this one. I've been to plenty of concerts where people behind me wanted to sit, and I've always stood my ground. It's not like you're blocking anyone's view or being a nuisance. You're just trying to have a good time."
3. **u/throwaway3456**: "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. If you're going to stand up, you should be considerate of the people around you. Maybe you could've asked the people behind you if they wanted to sit down, or offered to let them take your spot for a bit. That way, everyone could've been happy."
4. **u/throwaway9012**: "You're not the asshole, but you could've handled the situation better. Instead of getting defensive and calling people names, you could've tried to find a compromise. Maybe you could've stood in the back of the section or something. Just saying."
5. **u/throwaway6789**: "I'm with the OP on this one. If you're going to pay for a ticket, you should be able to enjoy the concert however you want. If the people behind you don't like it, they can either move or get their own seats. It's not like the OP is being rude or disruptive."

**Reddit's take:** The majority of the comments are in favor of the OP, saying that they have the right to enjoy the concert however they want and that the people behind them should've gotten seats in a different section if they didn't want to stand. Some comments suggest that the OP could've handled the situation better, but overall, the consensus is that the OP is not the asshole in this situation.

TITLE: I owe Chase 50K and they won't let me pay, what do I do?

POST: I have been unemployed (or without full time employment) since graduating in December of 2010. In September of 2011 my loans became due. I tried to deal with them then by staggering payments and trying to get an economic forbearance, but they would have none of if. Yesterday I called them again to try to work out a payment plan and they told me that the loan has been "charged off", and that I would have to deal with Chase's collections branch. They (the collections office) told me that the loan was now due in full. They added that no payment options were available aside from full payment, financing would have to be obtained through an outside party. I have no credit, I have no job, there is no one that is going to loan me 50K right now. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do at this point. 

side info: this is two private student loans, my wife co-signed, I own a house that I'm afraid will have a lien put on.

TL;DR: I owe Chase 50K, they won't let me pay, what do I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Have you considered talking to a non-profit credit counseling agency? They may be able to help you negotiate with Chase and come up with a payment plan that works for you. They may also be able to help you with other debt issues you may be facing."
2. **u/throwaway321456**: "I'm no expert, but it seems like Chase is trying to strong-arm you into paying the full amount. Have you considered talking to a lawyer? They may be able to help you negotiate a payment plan or even dispute the charge-off."
3. **u/throwaway789012**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot. Have you considered reaching out to your state's Attorney General's office? They may be able to help you with debt relief options or even investigate Chase's practices."
4. **u/throwaway456789**: "I'm not a financial expert, but I think you should try to get a second opinion from a different bank or credit union. Maybe they can offer you a better deal or work with you to come up with a payment plan."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're really struggling. Have you considered talking to a financial advisor? They may be able to help you come up with a plan to get back on your feet and start making payments again."

**Subreddit community response:**

The r/AskReddit community is very supportive and empathetic, with many users offering words of encouragement and advice. The top comments are all focused on helping the OP find a solution to their debt problem, with suggestions ranging from talking to a non-profit credit counseling agency to seeking legal advice. The community is also very understanding of the OP's situation, with many users acknowledging that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with debt, especially in today's economy.

**Key takeaways:**

* The r/AskReddit community is a valuable resource for people seeking advice and support with financial issues.
* Non-profit credit counseling agencies and financial advisors can be valuable resources for people struggling with debt.
* It's important to seek a second opinion from a different bank or credit union before making any decisions about debt repayment.

TITLE: Should my brother of 13 years be allowed to play Skyrim?

POST: Background: My brother wants to start playing Skyrim. Since I used to be a notorious gamer myself my father has asked me to decide if my brother should be able to play this game or if he really is to young, since its age limit is 16 (in my country). 
Now I'm not sure what to say on the one hand I don't want to be the bad parent to my brother that doesn't allow him to have fun (you know how these kids are) but on the other hand I want to provide a fair evaluation why he should or should not be able to play, to my father.

Could you also name reasons (for instance what parts in the game make it an absolute nogo) for why he should or should not be able to play.

TL;DR: Should my 13-year-old brother be allowed to play Skyrim? What are the reasons for or against?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Honestly, it's not about the age limit, it's about your brother's maturity level. If he's responsible enough to handle the game's content, then he should be allowed to play. But if he's not, then it's better to wait until he's older. Some parts of the game might be too intense or mature for a 13-year-old, like the blood and gore, or the themes of war and death. You should have a conversation with your brother and assess his maturity level before making a decision."
2. **u/gamer_guru**: "I think it's okay for a 13-year-old to play Skyrim, but only if you're going to supervise him and have a conversation about the game's content. The game does have some mature themes, but it's also a great way to learn about history, culture, and storytelling. Just make sure he's not playing it for too long and that he's taking breaks to do other things. You could also set some boundaries, like not allowing him to play certain parts of the game or limiting his playtime."
3. **u/parental_unit**: "As a parent, I would say that it's not about the game itself, but about the child's ability to handle the content. If your brother is mature enough to understand the themes and content of the game, then he should be allowed to play. But if he's not, then it's better to wait until he's older. You should also consider the impact that the game might have on his behavior and relationships. For example, if he starts to become too obsessed with the game, it could affect his relationships with his family and friends."
4. **u/old_gamer**: "I think it's okay for a 13-year-old to play Skyrim, but only if you're going to supervise him and have a conversation about the game's content. The game does have some mature themes, but it's also a great way to learn about history, culture, and storytelling. Just make sure he's not playing it for too long and that he's taking breaks to do other things. You could also set some boundaries, like not allowing him to play certain parts of the game or limiting his playtime."
5. **u/teenager**: "Honestly, I think it's okay for a 13-year-old to play Skyrim. I mean, I started playing games when I was 10 and I turned out fine. But, you know, it's not about the age, it's about the maturity level. If your brother is responsible enough to handle the game's content, then he should be allowed to play. But if he's not, then it's better to wait until he's older. You should also consider the impact that the game might have on his behavior and relationships. For example, if he starts to become too obsessed with the game, it could affect his relationships with his family and friends."



**Conclusion:**

The top comments on this post suggest that the decision to allow a 13-year-old to play Skyrim should be based on the child's maturity level and ability to handle the game's content. Some commenters argue that the game is not suitable for children under the age of 16 due to its mature themes and content, while others believe that it can be a great way to learn about history, culture, and storytelling. Ultimately, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the child's individual maturity level and ability to handle the game's content. The comments also suggest that it's important to supervise the child while they play and have conversations about the game's content to ensure that they understand the themes and messages being presented.

TITLE: I [20F] am finding myself seeking validation of my appearance from others, while not taking seriously my long-term boyfriend [20M]

POST: I think part of this has to do with the fact that I spend a lot of time with my boyfriend and his friends, so I'm constantly exposed to the way his friends talk about girls - not in a derogatory way, just kind of admiring certain girls' beauty and bodies.  I feel really immature for getting insecure when this happens because I know I'm pretty and I'm sure any of those guys would say the same. My boyfriend has hinted that his friends have said things about me being attractive before, but he always refuses to go into detail. I just wish every time I hung out with them I wasn't wearing sweatpants with no makeup on, because I feel like then they'd think of me less like a bro, and more like a hot girl. When I talk to my boyfriend about this and he tells me I'm beautiful, it just seems meaningless because of course he'd say that - he's my boyfriend. I feel really stupid and selfish for wanting more because I'm truly in a really happy relationship. I am just sick of my insecurities and I was wondering if this is a normal thing to feel. Does any of this make sense? Sorry, I'm typing on my phone so it's hard to look back and proofread.

TL;DR: I'm a 20F who's been feeling insecure about my appearance due to constant exposure to my boyfriend's friends' comments about girls. I feel like I'm seeking validation from others, but my boyfriend's reassurances don't seem meaningful because he's biased. I'm wondering if this is a normal thing to feel and if anyone else has dealt with similar insecurities.

RESPONSES:

1. OP, you're not alone in this feeling! I've been in similar situations where I've felt like I'm constantly seeking validation from others, especially when it comes to my appearance. It's like, I know I'm pretty, but I want to hear it from someone else, you know? And it's even harder when it's someone you're close to, like your boyfriend. I think it's normal to feel this way, especially in today's society where we're constantly bombarded with images of "perfect" bodies and faces. But the thing is, your boyfriend is biased, and that's okay! He loves you for who you are, sweatpants and all. You don't need validation from anyone else, especially not from his friends. You're beautiful just the way you are, and that's something you need to remember.

2. OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations where I've felt like I'm constantly seeking validation from others, especially when it comes to my appearance. And it's even harder when it's someone you're close to, like your boyfriend. I think it's normal to feel this way, especially in today's society where we're constantly bombarded with images of "perfect" bodies and faces. But the thing is, your boyfriend is biased, and that's okay! He loves you for who you are, sweatpants and all. You don't need validation from anyone else, especially not from his friends. You're beautiful just the way you are, and that's something you need to remember.

3. OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel insecure sometimes, especially when you're constantly exposed to comments about other girls. But the thing is, your boyfriend loves you for who you are, and that's what matters. You don't need validation from anyone else, especially not from his friends. You're beautiful just the way you are, and that's something you need to remember.

TITLE: TIFU by getting some food.

POST: Well this happened about an hour ago. I was at a restaurant with family. We ordered our food and sat down to eat. All was good up until we finished our food. At this restaurant they gave us Styrofoam plates and my cousin thought it was pretty funny to write "suck my ass :)" onto  his plate and it was directed at me. We didn't think much of it and we figured they are going to get thrown away. At this particular restaurant they didn't have a trash can and we had to give them the plates our selves. We left not thinking about it at all. As we were about to leave the owner or manager of this establishment told us we might as well not come back for the note we left them and now I can no longer go back. The worst part is one of them was a teacher at my school and its a pretty small town. I have no idea what tommorow has in store  for me but I hope it just blows over.

TL;DR: Wrote a note on a plate at a restaurant and now I'm in trouble with the owner and a teacher at my school.

TITLE: Speeding down highway. Can I get a ticket?

POST: 18, Male, Tennessee.
I was speeding, like 120 in a 65. Some girl kept trying to speed up with me in a shit car, I drive a turbo g35 it was no match but she wouldn't budge she'd push her little car around trying to pass me, and obviously putting her life in danger, I'm no godly driver but I know my car, and the road. I knew what I could do speed wise, and I constantly took it back to around 80 before she'd speed up. Eventually I had to turn, and she held up her phone, and a piece of paper, I assumed it was her number but now that I think about it she probably got my tags and plans to report or something, I want to know could I get in trouble? 
On mobile.

TL;DR: Speeding down highway, girl in a slow car tried to keep up, I took it back to 80, turned and she took a pic of my tags, could I get in trouble?

TITLE: Babysat a kitten over the weekend who turned out to have fleas - what should I do?

POST: I'm looking for some advice - I babysat a kitten over the weekend who it seems like just started getting fleas.  The owner had been aware of the flea dirt, but didn't do anything about it (and also didn't tell me that this was happening).  I found a few adult fleas on the kitten, and informed the owner and told her she needs to treat the kitten.  Now, I'm wondering what I should do about my apartment.  It seems like this was early on in terms of when the fleas started, however, I'm worried because I was hoping to adopt a new cat soon as my former cat passed away earlier this month.  Do you guys have any advice for how to treat my apartment and also how worried should I be about possible flea infestation?

TL;DR: Babysat a kitten with fleas, owner didn't tell me, now I'm worried about my apartment and potential flea infestation.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/FelineFanatic**: "Oh no, poor you! First, congratulations on being a responsible cat sitter. Now, let's get to the flea situation. For your apartment, I recommend vacuuming thoroughly, especially in areas where the kitten spent time. Wash any blankets or toys the kitten used. And, if you're feeling extra cautious, consider using a flea spray or powder on your furniture and carpets. As for adopting a new cat, I wouldn't let this scare you off. Just make sure to get a cat that's been treated for fleas and has a clean bill of health."
2. **u/CatLady3000**: "I'm so sorry you had to deal with this! Fleas are no joke. For your apartment, I'd recommend washing all bedding, towels, and clothing that the kitten came into contact with. Also, consider using a flea comb on your furniture and carpets to get rid of any stray fleas. As for adopting a new cat, I'd say go for it! Just make sure to get a cat that's been treated for fleas and has a clean bill of health. And don't forget to ask the breeder or shelter about the cat's flea history."

TITLE: Reddit: What MacGyver moments have made you feel like a total badass? I'll start....

POST: Just got inside from my apartment balcony after a half hour of trying to fish an envelope off the balcony below me with a tent pole. So I was going to throw my credit card down to my son's mom who was going to buy him some Pop Tarts because I'm on the 3rd floor and she'd just run down with the wrong card by accident and didn't want to come back up. I put it in a random envelope that was on my table just because it felt like the right thing to do before tossing it down and the envelope caught the wind and sailed onto the balcony directly beneath mine, which belongs to an unoccupied apartment. Too far from my balcony or the ground floor for a broom to reach, maintenance guy not available, I ponder 5 minutes or so. A light bulb flashes in my head....tent pole. I inserted each segment of the pole into the end of the other, but ultimately when I held it vertically the weight of it pulled it apart. Pulled it back up, scotch taped each joint (no good tape in the apartment, of course), gave it another 20 minutes, and bam, knocked it to the ground and went down and got it. My son's enjoying a blueberry poptart....Fuck yeah

TL;DR: MacGyvered a tent pole to fish an envelope off a balcony, felt like a total badass. Share your own MacGyver moments! 

**Comments:**

1. "I once used a hair dryer to fix a broken zipper on my jacket. I was on a plane and the pilot came over the intercom to ask if anyone knew how to fix it. I raised my hand and he asked me to come up to the cockpit. I was like 'yeah, I got this' and fixed it with the hair dryer. The whole plane erupted in applause. I felt like a total boss."
2. "I used a rubber band and a paperclip to fix a broken headphone cord. I was on a road trip and the cord snapped off in my hand. I was like 'oh no, how am I gonna listen to my music?' Then I remembered a rubber band and paperclip in my glove compartment. I wrapped the rubber band around the broken part and used the paperclip to hold it in place. Worked like a charm. Felt like a genius."
3. "I MacGyvered a makeshift splint for my friend's broken arm using a cardboard tube, some gauze, and a rubber band. We were at a music festival and he fell off the stage. I was like 'don't worry, I got this' and whipped up the splint. The paramedics were impressed and we got to skip the line at the hospital. Felt like a total hero."
4. "I used a straw to unclog a sink drain. I was at my grandma's house and the sink was clogged. I was like 'grandma, I think I can fix this' and used a straw to suck out the hair and soap scum. Worked like a charm. She was so impressed. Felt like a total MacGyver."
5. "I MacGyvered a makeshift phone charger using a USB cable, a battery, and some wire. I was on a camping trip and my phone died. I was like 'oh no, how am I gonna call for help?' Then I remembered some spare parts in my backpack. I whipped up the charger and was able to call for help. Felt like a total lifesaver."

TITLE: [18m]Hit off with girl at party, exchanged numbers, she set up a date... Now she says she might cancel due to studying, not sure how to proceed.

POST: Met a girl last night at a party, we talked ages and then exchanged numbers, she invited me for a drink at a bar this evening, earlier when I texted her about what time she wanted to go she says she might not be able to go due to studying.
I played it cool and said to text me later to say whether she is coming or not. 

I'm not sure how to go forward, we got on really well last night and she suggested the date and location, is her excuse legit? Should I try to setup an alternate date when (if) she texts later or contact her tomorrow morning about a new date? I've read that you should be positive and let the other person know you definitely want to spend time with them. I want to show her I'm interested without seeming desperate to go out with her.

TL;DR: Girl I met at party set up a date, then said she might cancel due to studying, unsure how to proceed.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for people to have last-minute changes in plans due to studying or other commitments. I'd suggest giving her some space and letting her come to you. If she's interested, she'll make an effort to reschedule. Don't be too pushy or aggressive, but also don't be too passive. You can send a casual 'Hey, hope you're doing well! Looking forward to hearing back from you about tonight' text and see how she responds."
2. **u/datingcoach**: "I agree with the previous commenter. Give her some space and let her come to you. If she's interested, she'll make an effort to reschedule. Also, don't be too hard on yourself if she cancels. It's not a reflection of your worth or the date itself. Remember, it's okay to have a 'no' and move on. You can always try to reschedule for another time if she's interested."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm a bit skeptical about her excuse. If she's really that busy with studying, wouldn't she have mentioned it earlier? Maybe she's just not that interested and is trying to get out of the date. If you're really interested in her, you could try sending a follow-up text asking if everything is okay and if there's anything you can do to help her with her studying. But don't be too pushy or clingy. You want to show her you care, not suffocate her with attention."
4. **u/optimistic_oliver**: "I think you should try to be understanding and accommodating. If she's really busy with studying, maybe you could suggest an alternate date or time that works better for her. Show her you're willing to work around her schedule and priorities. Just make sure you're not being too flexible or compromising your own needs and boundaries. Remember, communication is key in any relationship, so make sure you're having an open and honest conversation about your expectations and needs."
5. **u/cynical_charlie**: "Honestly, if she's canceling on you at the last minute due to studying, it's probably a sign that she's not that interested in you. Don't waste your time trying to reschedule or convince her to go out with you. You deserve better than someone who can't make up their mind or prioritize their own commitments. Move on and find someone who values your time and attention."

TITLE: TIFU by watching the film Chappie

POST: Background: I had some important things to get done today. I had to pay some extra rent on my place, sort out references and paperwork for a new job I'll be starting next month and a new house (I'll be moving away from where I currently live). I have also recently broken up with my SO of nearly four years, so unsurprisingly I'm an quivering, emotional wreck. 

I've always liked Neil Blomkamp's movies; District 9 was amazing and Elysium was ok. Chappie seemed like a fun-filled, action-packed hour and a half I thought. How wrong I was. I had *no* idea how emotional this film was. Without ruining the film, there's a lot of scenes when Chappie (a robot) learns about the world and starts asking some thought provoking questions about life. I got to a point in the movie and I totally lost it. I was sat there absolutely sobbing my eyes out for some bizarre reason. I'm a reserved guy, and considering the emotional impact my breakup had I did damn well on the crying front. It all came out during this movie. 

Twelve hours later, I have lost the place I was supposed be living at, I'm late sending a contract to my new job, and I forgot to book/schedule a bunch of other semi-important things.

TL;DR: I watched Chappie and had an emotional breakdown, forgot to do important things and now I'm in a bit of a pickle.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by watching a movie that was too relatable"
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. Maybe try watching a rom-com or something to lift your spirits?"
* "I've never seen Chappie, but I've heard it's a really emotional movie. Maybe try watching something else for a bit?"
* "I'm glad you're taking the time to process your emotions, but maybe try to get some of those important things done too?"
* "I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. Just remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're not alone. Hang in there, buddy!"


This post is a great example of how a subreddit can provide support and community for people who are going through tough times. The comments are full of empathy and understanding, with people offering words of encouragement and advice. The post itself is a great example of how a simple mistake or oversight can have a ripple effect and cause a chain of events that can be difficult to recover from. The author's emotional breakdown during the movie is relatable and understandable, and the comments are a great reminder that it's okay to not be okay and that people are there to support each other.

TITLE: How do I [28 M] get over my long-term GF [25 F] of 3 years

POST: So I'm reaching out here because I've been having a hard time essentially getting over my ex, who I felt was the one (it's nearly 3 weeks now since the break up). 

Without warning, we broke up when I found out she had gotten close with someone else during her break (vacation), and she said that she felt different about me when she had come back. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around having 3 years of good times, shared dreams, fears, and goals, and us working toward our future together, to be suddenly undone by one week being away. 

I feel devastated, and having already had trust issues prior due to childhood reasons, and a prior relationship, I feel like they've gotten worse (which I've opened up to her about before). She made me feel secure, loved, and wanted, especially since a lot of family oriented goals were brought up by her first. For everything to be suddenly turned upside down crushed me. 

I'm sure everyone feels this way after a breakup, but I'm just not sure how to handle the emotions that come in waves. You know, some days are better than others, but then I just have bad dreams about it nearly every other night. It also doesn't help that she's already moved on, and already in a committed relationship with this other person, and my mind keeps drifting to it.

So what do I do? I've been wrestling with the idea of reaching out to her somewhere down the line, and trying to seek closure, but I don't think that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm not really used to this kind of rejection, much less from a relationship that felt like it was going great. Especially since it was someone I felt so comfortable opening up with, and had so much in common with, you know?

TL;DR: 28 M, 3 years with 25 F, broke up due to her getting close with someone else during her break, feeling devastated, having trust issues, and unsure how to handle emotions.

This post is a good example of a common phenomenon in the r/relationships subreddit: the "heartbroken ex" post. The OP (original poster) is struggling to come to terms with the end of a long-term relationship and is seeking advice from the community on how to move on.

* The struggle to move on from a long-term relationship
* The pain of rejection and the feeling of being "left behind"
* The difficulty of dealing with trust issues and the fear of being hurt again
* The desire for closure and the uncertainty of how to achieve it

Overall, this post is a good example of the kind of content that is commonly found in the r/relationships subreddit, and it highlights the importance of community support and advice in helping people navigate the challenges of relationships.

TITLE: I (28F) just need to vent about my ex (30M) a little

POST: So we were together 5 years and living together most of that time. We broke up two months ago because things were pretty bad and he had a lot of his own issues to deal with. He basically told me that I'm an amazing GF but he's just so fucked up right now in his life that he ends up being a terrible BF and I don't deserve that etc. He told me that he still loves me but he could barely keep his shit together let alone be a decent boyfriend. He just couldn't be in a relationship right now

I understood this, and knowing his past and his problems this made a lot of sense. He was treating me pretty bad the last year of our relationship (i don't mean abusive) just inconsiderate and consumed with his own issues.

Well, two days ago I found out he was seriously dating another woman and I feel absolutely shattered. The break-up was a good thing, for both of us, but I'm stunned he's already dating seriously. 

I feel hurt because I truly felt for him and the tough time he was going through, I cried with him, and now I feel like it was all bullshit. I feel like he actually just wanted to find someone better than me

Anyway I've never felt more rejected in my life. I never thought it would affect me this way but I find myself utterly heartbroken.

someone please tell me this gets better

TL;DR: Ex broke up with me 2 months ago citing his own issues, now I find out he's dating someone else and I'm feeling utterly heartbroken and rejected

COMMENTS:

* "Girl, I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like he was never really invested in you or your relationship. You deserve so much better than someone who can't even be honest with themselves, let alone you. You'll get through this, and you'll find someone who truly loves and appreciates you for who you are"
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's hard to accept that someone we care about can move on so quickly. But remember that you were right to leave him, even if it was hard. You deserve someone who is willing to work through their issues with you, not someone who is just looking for a quick fix. You are strong and capable, and you will get through this"
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling so rejected. It's okay to feel that way, but try not to beat yourself up over it. You did the right thing by leaving him, and you deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are. Remember that you are worthy of love and respect, and you will find someone who sees that"
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like he was never really committed to you or your relationship. You deserve someone who is willing to work through their issues with you, not someone who is just looking for a quick fix. You are strong and capable, and you will get through this"

These comments offer words of encouragement, support, and validation to the OP, reminding her that she deserves better than someone who can't be honest with themselves or her, and that she will find someone who truly loves and appreciates her. They also acknowledge the pain and rejection she's feeling, but urge her not to beat herself up over it and to focus on her own worth and deservingness of love and respect.

TITLE: TIFU by not washing or brushing my teeth for 5 days whilst on a school trip.

POST: So this didn't happen today like many other posts on here. This happened 5 years ago and I went on a residential at school. I arrived at my room with 6 other friends and we all unpacked. I noticed I didn't have my toiletries bag with me. I thought I must have not packed it by mistake. All I have to do is ask one of my friends if I could borrow their stuff. Only, I decide not to do that. 
It was an exercise based trip with a lot of sports in the middle of the summer so it was very hot. I went swimming in the ocean, playing football (Soccer), caving etc. 
I speant all my money on the vending machine buying mints to try to keep my breath smelling bearable and I wore a hat at all times because I can imagine my hair was extremely greasy. 
I can't imagine how bad I smelt and nobody told me. Now here is the worst thing about it. My toiletries bag was with me the entire time.  It's just that when I had to pop out of our room when I was unpacking, one of my friends picked up the bag by mistake and instead of putting it back in my suitcase, they stuck it on the floor behind my suitcase and when I pushed my suitcase under the bed, it pushed the toiletries bag back to the wall. I didn't realise until I was packing to leave when I did a quick sweep to see if I left anything, to find that bag pushed up against the wall.

TL;DR: I didn't wash or brush my teeth for 5 days on a school trip because I didn't want to ask a friend for help and ended up stinking up the whole trip. I had my toiletries bag with me the whole time, but it got stuck behind my suitcase and I didn't find it until it was too late.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a story of how they messed up in a significant way. In this case, the author didn't wash or brush their teeth for 5 days on a school trip, which led to them smelling extremely bad and not being able to enjoy the trip as much as they could have. The post is relatable, entertaining, and serves as a cautionary tale for others who might find themselves in a similar situation. The title is attention-grabbing, and the post is well-written, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of humor and self-deprecation also makes the post more enjoyable to read. Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story that is both entertaining and informative.

TITLE: I, 19[f], am in love with my best friend 20[m]. How can i get him to fall for me?

POST: I have been in love with my best friend since year 2 of our friendship. He is the only person i trust in this world. 
Whenever he describes his perfect girl, he describes me, i don't even think he realizes it. He even goes so far to say "I want to marry my best friend". 
Its confusing, because he shows no interest in me thus-far. We get along great, we joke about & have fun.
I've loved him for the past four years, when i first realized it, i let him know. But he said didn't want to ruin our friendship. Ever since then I've acted like my feelings aren't there. I even give him helpful realtionship advice.
He is the only person i know i could trust in this world. 

What i want to know is how can i make him fall for me too? How can i show him I'm right for him?

TL;DR: I've been in love with my best friend for 4 years, he shows no interest. How can i make him fall for me too?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not about'making' him fall for you. It's about being genuine and authentic in your feelings and actions. If you've been in love with him for 4 years, why haven't you tried to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings? Maybe he's not ready or doesn't feel the same way. It's okay to be vulnerable and take the risk of potentially ruining the friendship, but it's also important to respect his boundaries and feelings."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on this situation. You've been friends for a long time, and it's okay if it doesn't work out romantically. You can still have a strong and meaningful friendship without romantic feelings. Maybe try to focus on building your friendship and see where it takes you."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. It's possible that he doesn't realize how you feel or that he's been too afraid to express his own feelings. But if he's not interested, it's okay to accept that and move on. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationships, and it's okay if it's not with him."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to'make' him fall for you. You can't control someone else's feelings, and it's not fair to expect him to feel the same way. Maybe try to focus on building your own self-confidence and self-worth, and see where that takes you. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether or not you're in a romantic relationship with your best friend."

**Reddit's Take:**

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly in favor of having an open and honest conversation with the best friend about one's feelings. Many commenters emphasize the importance of respecting the other person's boundaries and feelings, and not putting too much pressure on the situation. Some commenters also suggest that it's okay if the friendship doesn't work out romantically, and that the friendship can still be strong and meaningful even if the romantic feelings aren't reciprocated. Overall, the comments on this post are encouraging the OP to be genuine and authentic in their feelings and actions, and to prioritize building a strong and meaningful friendship regardless of the outcome.

TITLE: Dog is afraid of the basketball pole that's always been there? (hasn't been afraid of it previously)

POST: I have a chihuahua (pug mix) dog, (1 yr/5 months old). We usually take him for walks around the gated apartment complex, where the gardens are at, the neighbors have a basketball hoop (the ones filled with water to keep it standing). One day they left a carpet out in the sun to dry & he quite like it (he was rubbing/nudging on it & I guess when the thing shook/or when I lifted him to hop on the carpet it scared him).  Ever since he hasn't been ANYWHERE near it, he doesn't want to even go outside anymore near that area (he'll just go potty & come right back inside).  I have tried carrying him over there and just holding him walking towards it, but right when I put him down he runs for his life back home. Tail is in between his legs, never seen him like that before.

He has never been afraid of going over there before at all, EVER, always had to go over there to potty on his usual spots, and has never had a problem until that incident...

I have never seen him afraid of anything before like this.  Also, not sure if this is because recently a neighbor brought their friends dog over to play (near that area/female retriever/poodle mix but he's never seen her).

I have tried to put snacks (in a trail) near there and have him slowly go out so he wouldn't be afraid, but once he eats all the snacks in the trail, he runs right back home.

I have also attempted to put the snacks on the basketball hoop base & he has just eaten the food (or merely ignored it in panic/looking up all the time to see if anything is going to fall on him or something)...

Whenever he leaves his safety area (home) he looks up & around but mostly up... How can I help him see that the basketball hoop is not dangerous? (ie. it's secure & won't fall over anytime soon even in gusty wind conditions)

TL;DR: My dog is afraid of the basketball pole that's always been there, after an incident where it shook while he was playing. He won't go near it and is now afraid of the whole area. How can I help him overcome this fear?

**EDIT:** I've tried to desensitize him by putting treats on the ground near the basketball pole, but he just eats them and runs away. I've also tried to walk him by the pole while giving him treats, but he gets scared and runs away. I've tried to make the experience positive by throwing a ball near the pole, but he just runs away. I've also tried to block his view of the pole by putting a blanket over it, but he still gets scared. I've tried to make the experience calm by speaking softly and giving him treats, but he still gets scared. I've tried to make the experience fun by playing with him near the pole, but he still gets scared.

TITLE: My [18/F] ex BF[18/M] sent me a video of himself and I think I just cheated on my new BF [20/M]

POST: (Background) I just started university this year and before summer I broke up with my HS boyfriend of 2 years. I was in love with him, he was my first in everything and he is undeniably good looking. Unfortunately he turned 18 before me and went to the bar and proceeded to cheat on me while drunk and that ended the relationship.

I'm currently seeing someone I met during orientation and it's pretty serious, I like him, he's different but to be completely honest I'm not as attracted to him as I was with my ex. Anyways a couple nights ago he (my ex) commented on an old instagram picture of us, against my better judgement I replied and we started texting (I thought it was harmless) and it somewhat felt like old times.

Two nights ago I got a message from him and it was a video of him masturbating, of course I was shocked at first but that wore of pretty quickly and I got turned on, like really turned on. He called when I didn't message instantly and I guess we had facetime sex. I felt so horrible when I woke up.

I can't explain it other than I'm still very much attracted to him, he is extremely good looking, I can't not be. I have been ignoring him since then. I had a date with the guy I'm currently seeing tonight but I cancelled because I can't face him, to me it counts as cheating and I was cheated on before and it almost broke me, so I pretended to be sick. I'm pathetic and weak. 

Sidenote: I know he *(my ex) is flying back home for thanksgiving as well and  our parents are friends and I know they'll force me to atleast say hi to him so I can't hide. It's coming up soon and I'm just so confuse, I can't talk to any of my friends because I'm to embarrass. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Ex sent me a video of himself masturbating and we had facetime sex, I'm still attracted to him and I'm feeling guilty and weak for doing it. I'm currently seeing someone else and I'm not sure what to do.

TITLE: How do you stay healthy and "resist temptation" in a very unhealthy household?

POST: (bit of a rant ahead) 

My family is *extremely* unhealthy. Both of my parents are obese and my brother is one of those very picky eaters whose diet mainly consists of fast food, frozen junk, and just generally unhealthy meals/snacks. I've been trying for years to get my family to have a more healthy diet, but the most I've managed is getting them to finally buy some frozen vegetables (and I'm the only one who eats them). Needless to say, there isn't a lot of healthy food in my house.

I've managed to avoid becoming extremely unhealthy, but I've always been "chubby". I don't know what to do. For a while I said "fuck it" and started buying a lot of my own food, but it took up too much room in the kitchen so I had to stop. I still cook almost all of my own meals.

The thing that frustrates me most is that I know first-hand how much easier it is to stay healthy when I'm not surrounded by junk food. When I studied abroad, living in a family who barely had junk on hand, things like chips and pizza were a *treat* like they're supposed to be. Unhealthy foods rarely crossed my mind.

I know there's not really much else to it besides sucking it up and controlling myself, but any kind words or "tips" would be helpful. I've recently gained a fair amount of weight and feel like I have to take this very seriously before I start heading down the road of my parents. I have zero real support from anyone around me, so it's difficult.

TL;DR: I live in an unhealthy household and it's hard for me to stay healthy. I've tried to get my family to eat healthier, but it's not happening. I'm looking for advice on how to resist temptation and stay on track.

**Responses:**

1. **u/fitnessmotivation**: "Hey OP, I totally understand where you're coming from. It can be tough to stay healthy when those around you aren't. Here's what I do: I focus on my own goals and what I want to achieve. I also make sure to plan my meals and snacks in advance, so I'm not tempted by unhealthy options. And when I do give in, I don't beat myself up over it. I just get back on track. You might also consider finding a workout buddy or accountability partner to help keep you motivated. Good luck!"
2. **u/healthyliving**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's amazing that you're taking control of your own health despite the unhealthy environment around you. One thing that might help is to set small, achievable goals for yourself. Like, start by replacing one unhealthy meal per week with a healthy one. Or, try to eat one serving of fruits or veggies with every meal. It's all about progress, not perfection. And don't be afraid to seek out support online or in-person. There are plenty of resources available to help you stay on track."
3. **u/loseit**: "Hey OP, I totally get it. It's tough to stay healthy when those around you aren't. But here's the thing: you're not responsible for their health. You're only responsible for your own. So, focus on making healthy choices for yourself, and don't worry too much about what others are doing. And hey, if you need some motivation, just think about how good you'll feel when you reach your goals. You got this!"
4. **u/foodie**: "OP, I'm a bit of a foodie, and I have to say, I'm impressed by your determination to cook your own meals. That's not easy, especially when you're surrounded by unhealthy options. Here's a tip: try meal prepping! It can be a game-changer. You can prep healthy meals for the week, and then just grab and go. It's also a great way to save money and reduce food waste. Just a thought!"
5. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: "OP, I just wanted to say that it's not just about the food. It's also about the emotional support and encouragement you need to stay on track. It sounds like you're feeling really isolated and unsupported, and that can be tough. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor? They can help you work through some of the emotional challenges you're facing, and provide you with some much-needed support and guidance. Just a thought."

TITLE: she doesn't know i know -- girlfriend's adderall prescription

POST: Well. I feel like an asshole due to the invasion of privacy but I'll explain that in a second...

It all goes back to when I was driving her car because I didn't have one at the time. I was looking for some kind of chapstick and found a bottle of adderall in the storage between the driver and passenger seat.

I didn't say anything for a couple weeks because I had no idea how to approach it. I finally brought up the subject in a "general" way and she told me that she had taken it a couple times when she lived in NYC (1.5 or 2 years ago) but does not take it currently. I THEN brought it up a week later, telling her I FOUND IT by accident, and she said that her therapist had prescribed it but she won't be taking it and won't be getting it refilled.

Here's the horrible part:

I looked at her text messages because part of me didn't trust her. What did I find? A text message to her therapist from this past weekend asking the therapist to refill the prescription for adderall. 

How the hell do I approach this? I only ask because I'm not sure if I should be worried. Do I even say anything or do I just respect privacy? We live together. I'm aware this is amazingly hypocritical but shouldn't she be sharing this with me? Or no? This is the best relationship that's ever happened to me... curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's adderall prescription was found in her car, she initially denied taking it, then said she only took it once or twice in the past, but I found a text message asking her therapist to refill the prescription. Should I approach her about this or respect her privacy?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're not an asshole for being concerned. You have every right to know what's going on in your partner's life, especially when it comes to prescription medication. Approach the conversation calmly and try to understand why she didn't tell you about it in the first place. Maybe she was embarrassed or didn't want to worry you. But it's clear she's not being entirely honest with you, and that's a red flag."
* "I agree with the above comment. You deserve to know what's going on in your partner's life, especially when it comes to medication. But approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Ask her why she didn't tell you about it and how she's feeling about it. Maybe she's struggling with addiction or other issues. Try to have an open and honest conversation about it."
* "I'm not sure I agree with the above comments. You did invade her privacy by looking at her text messages. That's a huge betrayal of trust. You need to apologize and make it right. You can't just expect her to be honest with you after you've broken her trust."
* "I think you should talk to her about it, but not in a confrontational way. Try to have a calm and rational conversation about it. Ask her why she didn't tell you about it and how she's feeling about it. Maybe she's struggling with addiction or other issues. Try to be understanding and supportive."
* "I think you should respect her privacy. You found something that was private and personal, and you shouldn't have looked at her text messages. You need to apologize and make it right. You can't just expect her to be honest with you after you've broken her trust."

This post highlights the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication, trust, and respect. The OP is torn between their desire to know what's going on in their partner's life and their own feelings of guilt and shame for invading her privacy. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from those who believe the OP has a right to know what's going on in their partner's life to those who think the OP should respect her privacy and apologize for their actions. Ultimately, the post raises important questions about the boundaries of relationships and how to navigate situations where trust has been broken.

TITLE: What's the hungriest you've ever really been?

POST: [This] thread got me thinking about the "disgusting" things I'd eat if I was *really* hungry. I don't mean the kind of hungry when lunch is still two hours away and the coffee you had for breakfast isn't helping anymore and you groan to your coworker *"I'm starving!"* I mean hungry like you haven't had a bite to eat in days and you're not sure when you'll eat again.

For me, it was 1994 and I was 20 years old living with my first boyfriend. We often survived on end-of-day leftovers at our crappy fast food jobs. Business got slow and we both got fired from our jobs and we were just too dumb to think about the fact that the money we were spending on cigarettes and Dr. Pepper should *probably* be used for PB&J. 

He got a part time job at KFC so he got at least one free meal a day, and I'd usually walk there to share that with him. It was almost Thanksgiving and his hours got cut back from 24 a week to 18, then 12, then they let him go altogether. Just before he left, he stole a bag of powdered mashed potatoes. (Desperate times, desperate measures?) We ate mashed potatoes for every meal for a week until it was just gone. Then there was nothing, and it was the day after Thanksgiving and all the food pantries were closed, and then it was the weekend and we were SO hungry.

Those three days with nothing but water were probably the longest of my life. Strangely, after the 24 hour mark I stopped feeling hunger pains and just felt tired and moody. Any time I thought about food, I'd drink water or eat ice. (I found out several years later that while I had been starving, my boyfriend had been secretly visiting his family and having lunch or dinner with them. His family hated me, they felt I stole away their little boy, and there's no way they'd have fed me. My family wasn't talking to me because I was "living in sin" with him, so I didn't have backup like he did.)

TL;DR: I was 20, living with my boyfriend, and we were both fired from our jobs. We survived on leftovers and then KFC meals until he got let go. We ate mashed potatoes for a week, then there was nothing. I went 3 days without food, and it was a weird, tired, moody experience.

Recently, she has been talking to this other guy. However, she says she has been unhappy for three months. She says that she was planning on breaking up with me for a while. She says she is not breaking up with me for this guy. We still live together, she still likes to cuddle. I'm so confused. She. wants her space she says, and maybe in a few months we'll work it out.

TITLE: I'm a [21M] in a relationship with a [44F]. But there is a problem on her side of things..

POST: Not going to bore you but attempt to be straight to the point. 

I've been with her around 4 months now and I've met 2 of her children (13M/4M) and I know they're quite young and probably don't understand relationships yet but they're perfectly fine with it and welcome me with open arms (well, the 13 year old anyways, get on with him really well whereas the 4 year old just want to play all the time)

Anyways, only 1 problem is that she has a 21M son who lives away at university most of the year but has been home for the past 15 days or so.

Now I've gotten to see my girlfriend on occasions but not as much because of him being around, but the problem is she's afraid he'll go off the rails if he finds out about me with me being the same age. She said she feels so close to me and can't leave me because it'd break her heart but she's fighting a huge battle in my opinion and I don't want her to lose her son. The last thing I want to cause is a family rift. 

I want to be with her so much and I can't decide what to do or what to suggest to her. 

Can anybody help or advise me on what I could say/do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has a 21M son who's away at university but has been home for 15 days. She's afraid he'll go off the rails if he finds out about me (same age) and she's torn between her feelings for me and her relationship with her son. I don't want to cause a family rift and want to be with her but unsure what to do or say.

**Comments:**

* OP, you're in a tough spot. It's understandable that you don't want to cause a family rift, but you also have feelings for your girlfriend. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns? It might be helpful to explore ways to address her son's potential reaction and find a solution that works for everyone involved.
* I think it's great that you're considering the potential impact on her son. However, it's also important to consider the potential impact on your own well-being and happiness. Are you willing to put your own feelings and desires on hold indefinitely to avoid causing a rift? It might be helpful to have a conversation with your girlfriend about what you're willing to compromise on and what your non-negotiables are.
* OP, have you talked to your girlfriend about what she wants to happen in the future? Does she see a future with you, or is she just enjoying the present moment? It might be helpful to have a conversation about what she's hoping for and what she's willing to work towards.
* I think it's important to remember that her son is an adult, and it's ultimately his decision whether or not he wants to accept you as his mother's partner. While it's understandable that she's worried about his reaction, it's also important to respect his autonomy and allow him to make his own decisions.
* OP, have you considered the possibility that her son might not be as opposed to you as she thinks he might be? It's possible that he's just not aware of the situation or hasn't had a chance to process his feelings yet. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him and get his perspective on the situation.
* I think it's great that you're taking the time to consider the potential impact on her son. However, it's also important to remember that you're not responsible for her son's feelings or reactions. You can't control how he feels or what he does, but you can control how you respond to the situation. It might be helpful to focus on what you can control and what you're willing to compromise on, rather than trying to control the outcome.

TITLE: Well, I don't know where else to post this

POST: So I recently moved to a new school and on my second day, met a girl who shall here forth be called "Kim". We became fast friends and I realized that was I was starting to develop feelings for her, but these feelings were stronger than I had ever had for anybody before. I was going a little out of my mind keeping my feelings for her in, and finally on Friday I told her my feelings and she essentially said that she gets it, whatever, and we carried on as usual. This was fine with me, and we actually talked all day Saturday. However, on Sunday she ignored me, and today she's been scattered in replying to my texts and other attempts to communicate. This is my first point. My second, is that after I started talking to Kim, she introduced me to her best friend, who we shall now call "Ruby". So I was pining after Kim, but at the same time I really wanted to make a connection with Ruby. We shared a lot more interests, but I still had stronger feelings for Kim. Now, when I was going crazy, Ruby really helped me out and gave me good advice. She has consistently given me good advice and been really helpful at any moment in our friendship. Once I told Kim about my feelings, she started to stand out to me. Ruby seemed so... different then. I realized that this entire time, I've tried to repress any feelings I had for her, as I didn't want anyone other than Kim. I have such a different feeling towards Ruby though. With Kim, just talking to her makes me happy, but whenever we fall out of contact, I just start to get deep emotional pain. But I can't really put a finger on my feelings for Ruby. She makes me happy, and I feel such a need to make her happy and protect her from anything. Right now, I am in immense conflict with this, and could really use some advice.

TL;DR: I told my friend Kim I had feelings for her, and she didn't really respond. Now I'm torn between my feelings for her and my growing feelings for her best friend Ruby. I don't know what to do.

---

This post is a classic example of a "crisis of the heart" – a situation where someone is torn between their feelings for two people, and they're not sure what to do. The OP (original poster) is struggling to navigate their emotions and figure out what they really want.

The post is well-written and provides a lot of context, which helps the reader understand the situation. The OP is also honest about their feelings and is seeking advice, which shows that they're willing to listen and learn.

Some possible ways to respond to this post could include:

* Encouraging the OP to take some time to reflect on their feelings and what they really want
* Suggesting that the OP talk to Kim and Ruby separately to get a better sense of how they feel
* Reminding the OP that it's okay to have feelings for multiple people, and that it's not uncommon to experience conflicting emotions
* Offering advice on how to navigate the situation and make a decision that feels right for the OP

Overall, this post is a great example of a "relationship advice" post, and it's a great opportunity for the community to offer support and guidance.

TITLE: My fiance [27/F] just broke it off with me [28/M] and I'm feeling lost and confused.

POST: We've been dating for 3 years and we've been great friends since high school.  We got engaged in November and were about to lock up a venue for our wedding when everything came down.

We talked on Sunday because she had been stalling on signing the agreement with the venue, and she said she wasn't sure she was ready to get married.  She then said that she needed some time to get her head straight and then said that she wanted to take a break for a few months to figure out what she wants.

We got a house together in July, and things had been going great.  We were both happy.  I feel like she is scared of the responsibility and commitment that a relationship requires.

I don't know how to get her back and I'm terrified that I won't be able to.  I love her to death and the last few days have been brutally tough.  Any advice or thoughts on this to help me out would be much appreciated.  I'm in the dark here.

TL;DR: Fiance broke off engagement and wants a break for a few months. We've been together for 3 years and I'm feeling lost and confused.

COMMENTS:

* "OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like your fiancée is having some serious doubts about the relationship and the commitment that comes with marriage. It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed by the idea of marriage, especially if they're not ready to take on the responsibilities that come with it. Have you talked to her about what specifically is making her feel uncertain? Maybe there's something you can work on together to address her concerns."
* "OP, I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If your fiancée is willing to break off the engagement and take a break, it's likely that she's not ready to commit to you long-term. You deserve someone who is willing to work through the tough times and commit to you fully. Don't be afraid to take some time for yourself and focus on your own healing and growth."

TITLE: I dont know who I am

POST: Not in the amnesiac sense.  I just dont know what makes me me anymore.  I always remember being the smartest person in a room, but now with my new job, my inexperience makes me the dumbest person around.  I used to be really in to Jiu Jitsu, I started in college.  I had the same partner for four years, and we even started dating.  Then she went to a different section of the united states, and I started trying to set my self up to be able to move to her.  She left me, and married her instructor in like a three month span.  I dont know what to do, it almost feels like there is no point to do the martial art anymore.  I always prided myself in being in the number one fighter of my social circle.  I know, being half a country away, they arent in my circle anymore, but as the very least my ex is a fellow Redditor. (so of course im using a throwaway.)  I cant find new employment, I cant move out of my parents house.

TITLE: Me [23F] with my SO [30 M] 1.5 years, Those who have been on a break due to depression/needing space, and really love each other. How did you make it work? How do you navigate a break?

POST: My SO (30 M) and I (23 F) have decided to take a break due to his holding back for months that he was getting depressed. I have had mental issues my entire life that include OCD, Anxiety and Depression so I understand how hard it was to him and where it was coming from. 

He didn't want to lose me from his life, and I didn't want to lose him. We love the hell out of each other.

Neither of us have had a "break" before, and we want it to work/be beneficial.

as he said "I want to look back on this one day with you and agree that it brought us closer and made us stronger". 

So, we decided that the onus of contact is on him, and he calls me twice a day to talk. We met up today {had the conversation on Friday} because he *really* wanted to see me. I'll admit i wanted to see him too.

So those who have been on a break, and it was successful please advise!

What were your ground rules, how long was your break, what do you *do* to make sure its successful?

TL;DR: Me and my SO took a break due to his depression. We love each other, but needed space. We want to make it work and come out stronger. How did you make it work? What were your ground rules? Help!

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Prioritize communication**: Communication is key to making a break work. Set clear boundaries and agree on how often you'll check in with each other.

3. **Set realistic expectations**: Don't expect your partner to be the same person they were before the break. People grow and change, and it's okay if your partner is different when you get back together.
4. **Agree on a plan for reconnection**: Discuss how you'll reconnect and what your expectations are for the relationship moving forward.
5. **Be patient and understanding**: Breaks can be challenging, but it's essential to be patient and understanding with each other. Remember that you

TITLE: My [23M] friend [20F] invites/begs me to accompany her on unnecessary shopping trips then asks me to pay for gas.

POST: I come from the city so I'm a veteran public transportation rider. I attend a University where the public transportation isn't in abundance but still reliable. 

Recently my friend has gotten a new car and in excitement, has been using it frequency. This has led to her asking, and later begging me to join her on trips to the store/mall/anywhere off campus. 

At first, I agreed to these trips since she was still in that "freedom" phase of owning a car. After a few weeks, she'd started demanding gas money for her service. 

I would normally pay for all my goods and services, but I'm baffled at this. She invites me on this little runs willingly, and mostly to places I do not need/care to go. I have told her often that I would rather use the public transportation as my University student fees pay for it. When I turn her down, she asks again or passive aggressively comments on not spending time with her. 

I do not have a lot of money compared to her. She comes from a rich family and has a fair bit of cash on her at all times. 

I do not understand the underlying issue or how to address it.

TL;DR: Friend invites me on unnecessary shopping trips, then asks me to pay for gas. I'm a student and prefer public transportation, but she keeps asking and gets upset when I decline.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "It sounds like your friend is taking advantage of your willingness to spend time with her. You're right to prioritize your own financial situation and transportation preferences. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you feel. Let her know that you value your friendship, but you can't continue to accommodate her requests without some compromise."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think there's a bigger issue here. Your friend is using you for transportation and expecting you to pay for it. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve to be treated with respect and fairness in your friendships. Consider setting boundaries and re-evaluating the friendship if she's not willing to compromise."
3. **u/financially_savvy**: "I'm a bit surprised you're not charging her for gas. You're essentially subsidizing her transportation costs. Consider setting a rate for gas reimbursement or finding alternative transportation options. This will help you maintain a healthy financial relationship with your friend."
4. **u/communication_is_key**: "It's great that you're trying to communicate your feelings to your friend, but it sounds like she's not listening. Try framing the conversation differently. Instead of saying 'I don't want to go,' say 'I appreciate the offer, but I'd rather use public transportation. Can we find another way to spend time together?' This approach focuses on finding a solution that works for both of you."
5. **u/unsolicited_opinion**: "Honestly, your friend sounds like a bit of a spoiled brat. She's used to getting what she wants and isn't willing to compromise. You deserve better than that. Consider distancing yourself from the friendship or setting clear boundaries. You don't have to enable her entitled behavior." 

---

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'll try to have a more open conversation with my friend about how I feel. I'll try to frame it in a way that focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us, rather than just saying no. I'll also consider setting a rate for gas reimbursement or finding alternative transportation options. And, yeah, I can see how my friend's behavior might be perceived as entitled. I'll try to take a step back and re-evaluate the friendship if she's not willing to compromise. Thanks again for your input!"

TITLE: Should I stay or should I go (24f)

POST: Hello reddit. Sorry for the throwaway, my boyfriend (m27) is the one who introduced me to reddit, so I'm sure he'd find this post if I used my real account. 

My SO and I have been dating for a year and a half. We met at work and saw each other pretty much everyday. Recently he took a new job about 200 miles away so we see each other about every 3 weeks.

My dilemma is that he WILL NOT talk about the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it's hard to be in this LDR without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that thats something we both want. When we were with each other all the time the future didn't seem to matter as much. But now that he's gone and we're trying to stay together I feel like I need some reassurance as to WHY we're engaging in a LDR with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it's worth doing it.

I have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. 

I just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it was one of my friends asking me for advice I would tell them to let him go and move on if he can't make up his mind about you. But for some reason it's harder to see when it's your own life. I know he loves me and I know he's indecisive about almost everything else. Maybe he's taking me sticking by him for granted? I just don't know.

So should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 1.5 years took a new job 200 miles away and we're in a LDR. He won't talk about the future and I'm feeling uncertain about our relationship. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he's not ready to make any big decisions. I'm torn between staying and trying to make it work or moving on. Help!

**Follow-up post:**

The OP has posted a follow-up to her original post, updating users on her decision and the outcome of her conversation with her boyfriend.

"Hey everyone, I just wanted to follow up on my original post. I've been thinking a lot about what you all have said and I've decided to take a break from the relationship. I know it's not an easy decision, but I feel like I need some time to focus on myself and figure out what I want.

I did have a conversation with my boyfriend about my concerns and he listened, but he still didn't give me any concrete answers about the future. He said he loves me and wants to make it work, but he's just not ready to make any big decisions. I know he's not a 'future talker' and that's okay, but I need someone who is willing to work through the tough times with me.

I'm not saying it's definitely over, but I do think I need some space and time to think about what I want. I appreciate all of your advice and support, it's been really helpful to me.

TITLE: My husband is suddenly way more into my dirty asshole than I am anywhere near comfortable with and I don't know what to do. (M24, F31)

POST: We've been married for four years, together for five. Suddenly all he wants to do is sniff my asshole and armpits regardless of when I last showered. I love him a lot of want to make him happy but it makes me feel so fucking gross. I've tried to be GGG about it and just let him but it really turns me off and the last thing I want is to have sex with him afterward. I just find myself getting angry and feeling used.

These days it's like he hugs me and cuddles me and them gets on his knees and shoves his face into my ass crack, or he hugs me and tries to shove his hand in my ass crack. I asked him if he could maybe build up to that instead of going for it right out of the gate but he doesn't seem amenable to it. I've started to turn him down every time he reaches for me because I don't want to be sniffed like a dog. I don't even want him to touch me anymore.

He confessed that he really wanted this when we were drunk one night and I said I would try it but I just can't get into it. He wants to stick his tongue into my asshole then kiss me and it makes me want to fucking vomit. He's hinted at wanting to try piss play too. I have absolutely no interest in that.

I don't know what to do. I love him and I feel like I've tried to be as GGG about this as I can but fuck. There is SO MUCH kinky shit I'd be happy to try but why does it have to be this? Bodily wastes and armpit stank just have no appeal for me. I mean if he wanted to do all this shit fresh after a shower, sure, but he doesn't. He seems upset when I shower before bed now.

Seriously, at a total loss here. When the fuck did I marry Napoleon?

TL;DR: Husband suddenly super into sniffing my asshole and armpits, I'm not comfortable with it and it makes me feel gross. I've tried to be GGG but it's just not for me. Help.

TITLE: Need insight... Is my(21F) boyfriends(24m) view on marriage normal?

POST: I've been with my boyfriend nearly 3 years, lived together for two.

I've pretty much been ready to get engaged for the last few months, he is not,  which is ok because we are still young, don't really wanna rush into things and I'm ok with waiting. In pretty sure he's my soulmate.  

Living together has been smooth sailing, we just signed a lease for another year. We're both tidy enough, split chores evenly, finances in order. Normal stuff. We don't really fight. 

Anyways, we were talking about marriage and the future and he thinks that being married will be hard. I asked why he thought that and he said living with another person is hard. I asked him if living with me currently was hard, he said no. This didn't make sense to me obviously. So he goes on to say that after about 4 yrs of being together then "biologically" staying together in a marriage is just about having "sheer willpower", as if it's a struggle staying together longer than that. 

Ok I know marriage can be hard, I watched my parents stay in a shitty marriage for years with constant fighting. I know things change after the honeymoon phase (pretty sure we are past that by now). But I don't think people only stay together because of "willpower". It kinda makes me feel sad that he has that expectation of me in the future. 

Is there any truth to this point of view? Is he mistaken? I just don't understand where he got that idea, his parents have been together for 27 years and are very happy it seems. 

Am I just naive to think marriage won't be that bad? I mean we already live together, how much more will things change?

TL;DR: Boyfriend thinks marriage will be hard because living with someone is hard, but he says living with me currently isn't hard. He also thinks after 4 years, staying together in a marriage is just about "willpower". I'm worried he has unrealistic expectations and I don't know if I should be concerned.

**Top Comments:**

* "I think your boyfriend might be underestimating the challenges of marriage. Living together can be great, but marriage brings its own set of responsibilities and expectations. It's not just about having 'willpower' to stay together. Marriage requires communication, compromise, and a willingness to work through issues together. It's not always easy, but it can be incredibly rewarding."
* "I think it's great that you're having this conversation with your boyfriend! It's important to have open and honest discussions about your expectations and concerns. Maybe you can ask him what specifically he means by 'willpower' and what he thinks the biggest challenges of marriage will be. It might help him clarify his thoughts and you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I think your boyfriend might be coming from a place of fear or uncertainty. Marriage can be intimidating, especially if he's never been married before. It's possible that he's worried about losing his independence or feeling trapped. You might want to have a conversation with him about what he's afraid of and see if you can address those concerns together."
* "I think you're being a bit too hard on your boyfriend. He's not saying that marriage is impossible, just that it requires effort and commitment. Maybe you can try to see things from his perspective and understand where he's coming from. It's not always easy to be in a relationship, but it can be incredibly rewarding if you're willing to put in the work."
* "I think you should take a step back and assess your own feelings and expectations about marriage. Are you really ready to get married? Are you prepared for the challenges that come with it? Maybe you're putting too much pressure on your boyfriend to get married because you're not sure if you're ready yourself. Take some time to reflect on your own feelings and then have a conversation with your boyfriend about what you both want and expect from your relationship."

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my Girlfriend [19 F] of 1 month. I think it might be me, but she's acting differently. What gives?

POST: I'll keep this brief, but when I had met my girlfriend we would hang out non stop, text often, etc.. Sadly her grandfather had passed, so we put things on hold for a couple weeks.
Now she's been a pain to text, and to try to hang out with. However there are a few days where she'll text me and ask to hang out. I understand that she doesn't like to text much, but say last night; she invited me out to an even with her family, we had a great time and I had texted her that I did last night, and to thank her family for inviting me. I got nothing back, which means she probably was asleep, so I figured I text her and ask her to hang out today since I know we both didn't have work. Yet, 8 hours later still nothing.

What gives? Sometimes she'll text me a lot, so I'm a bit confused. Should I try not to message her until she messages me?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 1 month has been distant and unresponsive, but occasionally texts me and asks to hang out. I'm confused and unsure what to do.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like she's going through a tough time with her grandfather's passing, and it's normal for people to need space during that time. Maybe try giving her some space and not putting too much pressure on her to respond or hang out. When she's ready to talk or hang out, she'll reach out to you."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's possible that she's just not feeling the same level of connection with you right now, and that's okay. Instead of trying to force the issue, try to focus on building a stronger connection with her when she's ready. Ask her how she's doing, listen to her, and show her that you care. Don't take it personally if she's not responding as quickly as you'd like."
3. **u/justanotheruser**: "I think you're overthinking this. She's probably just busy with work/school/family stuff and hasn't had a chance to respond. Try not to read too much into it and just give her some space. If you're feeling anxious or unsure, you could try sending her a simple 'hey, how's it going?' text and see if she responds."
4. **u/relationshipexpert**: "It's great that you're aware of your own emotions and are seeking advice. However, it's important to remember that you can't control how others respond to you. Instead of trying to figure out what's going on with her, focus on what you can control, which is your own behavior. Keep being a good partner, show her that you care, and let her know that you're there for her when she's ready to talk."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Give your girlfriend space and don't put too much pressure on her to respond or hang out.
* Focus on building a stronger connection with her when she's ready.
* Don't take it personally if she's not responding as quickly as you'd like.
* Try not to overthink it and just give her some space.
* Keep being a good partner and show her that you care. Let her know that you're there for her when she's ready to talk.

TITLE: Any advice for which college program? Information technology. I need someone with experience in the field.

POST: Hello my name is Daniel. I am 24 years old and i am going to be going to college for the first time! I am finally able to go as independent so now is the time to get help with tuition. I start in the fall!

I would like a little guidance from the community here. I decided to go to a community college first, as to not load myself up with debt. I am looking to go into the tech sector. 

These are what i'm looking at:

Software Development A.A.S. Degree
I am looking at computer programming #1. I am not the most creative person, but i can definitely create something with the correct inspiration. And.... i love computers and solving problems.

With an Associates in Applied Science, i should be able to get work pretty quickly if i do well if what I've researched is correct.
But if i we're to attain this degree, what can i do to advance my education and achieve a bachelor's degree or get a better job? Is a bachelor's even needed to move up in the industry?

Computer Support and Network Administration A.A.S.
I'm also good with people and would love working in a field that is actively working with people to solve problems.

Is there way to advance my education past the AAS in this field? What can i do to advance my education and achieve a bachelor's degree or get a better job in networking? Is a bachelor's even needed to move up in the industry?

TL;DR: I'm going to college for the first time and I'm looking for advice on which program to choose. I'm interested in IT and I'm considering two programs: Software Development and Computer Support and Network Administration. I want to know if a bachelor's degree is necessary to advance in the industry and what I can do to advance my education.

---

**Comments:**

* "Hey Daniel, congrats on taking the first step towards furthering your education! Both programs you're considering are great options. For software development, a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, but it's not necessarily required. Many companies look for experience and skills over a degree. For computer support and network administration, a bachelor's degree can be helpful, but it's not as crucial as it is in software development. You can always consider online courses or certifications to advance your education and skills. What's your current experience with computers and programming?"
* "I'm a software developer and I can attest that a bachelor's degree is not always necessary. What's more important is having a strong portfolio and being able to demonstrate your skills. You can start by building small projects and contributing to open-source projects to gain experience. For computer support and network administration, a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, but it's not the only way to advance. You can consider getting certified in areas like CompTIA A+ or Cisco CCNA to increase your chances of getting hired."
* "I'm a network administrator and I can tell you that a bachelor's degree is not always necessary. What's more important is having hands-on experience and being able to troubleshoot issues. You can start by getting certified in areas like CompTIA Network+ or Cisco CCNA to increase your chances of getting hired. For software development, a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, but it's not the only way to advance. You can consider getting certified in areas like Java or Python to increase your chances of getting hired."

**Conclusion:**

The comments provided a range of perspectives and advice from individuals with experience in the IT field. They emphasized the importance of having a strong portfolio and being able to demonstrate skills, rather than just having a degree. They also suggested that certifications, such as CompTIA A+ or Cisco CCNA, can be beneficial in advancing one's education and career. Overall, the comments provided valuable insights and advice for Daniel as he navigates his decision about which college program to choose.

TITLE: I (19 F) am scared of smothering and loving my bf (19 M) too much. ((End of honeymoon stage?))

POST: My problem is extremely simple, and has been on my mind a little bit. 

They say that after a while of dating and being together you start to ween out of the honeymoon stage and start to have a simple relationship with one another. But we have been dating for almost a year now, next month, and I feel like that stage hasn't ended for me yet, though it does seem to have with him.

I go to school about 2 hours away from him, so we only see eachother now and again on weekends. But when we are together, I tend to love on him all day. I watch him play games, cuddle, watch movies/shows with him. Even when we hang out with his friends or are in public, I tend to want to hold his hand and give him kisses.

He on the other hand is of course past this. He has said that he both likes and dislike my lovey-doveiness. Sometimes he loves it because he feels important/special/wanted. Othertimes it is kind of annoying or clingy.

But I'm just not sure what to do about it. I always want to show him how much I love him and how happy he makes me, but I also don't want to be a smothering gf.

TL;DR: I'm 19, been dating my bf for almost a year, and I'm scared of smothering him with my love. He says he likes it sometimes, but other times it's annoying. What do I do?

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships, particularly during the early stages of dating. The OP (original poster) is struggling with the desire to show their love and affection for their partner, but is worried about crossing the line into smothering. This is a relatable concern, as it's natural to want to express one's feelings, but it's also important to respect the other person's boundaries.

The OP's situation is further complicated by the fact that they are in a long-distance relationship, which can make it more challenging to navigate these feelings. The distance can create a sense of longing and intensity, which may contribute to the OP's desire to shower their partner with love and attention.

The OP's partner's mixed reactions to their lovey-doveiness are also a significant factor in this situation. On the one hand, he appreciates the attention and feels special when the OP shows him affection. On the other hand, he finds it annoying or clingy at times. This mixed reaction can be confusing and frustrating for the OP, who wants to make their partner happy but is unsure of how to do so.

To address this issue, the OP might consider having an open and honest conversation with their partner about their feelings and concerns. They could ask him to clarify what he likes and dislikes about their lovey-doveiness, and work together to find a balance that makes both of them comfortable. The OP might also consider setting boundaries for themselves, such as giving their partner space when they need it or engaging in activities that they both enjoy together.

Ultimately, the key to resolving this issue is communication, empathy, and understanding. By working together and being open to each other's needs and feelings, the OP and their partner can find a way to navigate this challenging situation and build a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by answering my phone

POST: Actually happened yesterday. So theres this girl I've met on the internet and we were already chatting for a couple of months. She was the kinda girl that *really* liked talking on the phone. I told her many times that I usually don't like talking on my phone that much but she kept calling me two to three times a day. So one day she couldn't hear me, no idea why. I tried sending voicemails and other stuff but it seemed like my microphone was broken and i told her that. Later that day I just tried restarting my phone and everything worked again, thing is, I never told her that. I lied to her and said something about a repair that would cost 60€ and I didn't want to spend my money for that. Fast forward a few weeks, She asked me out on a date. I've never seen her as a potential girlfriend but decided to meet her anyways just so see how it goes. So the date was going meh, and when she went to see the toilet I wrote my friend a message that he should call me about an importent appointment I forgot to get myself out of this date a quickly as possible. She came back and two minutes later I recieved the call from my friend. Afte I exchanged some words with my friend, I realized what I just did. The girl looked at me as if I just killed somebody. At this point, I knew there was no going back. I lied to her because I didn't want to spend time talking to her and she knew that now too. She looked pretty angry, ran out of the restaurant and I haven't heard anything from her since. Needlesly to say, I'm not going to see her again.

TL;DR: I lied to a girl I met online about my phone being broken and then got caught when I took a call from my friend during a date. She's not talking to me anymore.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a story about how they messed up in a situation and the consequences that followed. In this case, the OP lied to a girl they met online about their phone being broken, and then got caught when they took a call from their friend during a date. The girl was understandably upset and hasn't spoken to the OP since.

The post is relatable and entertaining, and the OP's honesty about their mistake is admirable. The comments on the post are also funny and supportive, with many people sharing their own stories of similar mistakes. Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/tifu community can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their mistakes and learn from them.

TITLE: Can loseit help me lose 15 pounds?

POST: I just bought my prom dress online, and to my horror I found that it didn't fit properly. Sadly, the dress went through 3 countries before I got it and so the deadline for sending the dress back is long past. Therefore I'm hell-bent on making the dress fit. I want to lose about 15 pounds before prom in June, and wondered if loseit could help me!

I'm 17, F, 5 7" and about 185 pounds. In other words overweight. I've always been of the muscular type with a somewhat bulky (ಠ_ಠ) upper body, and I want to lose fat, and not so much muscle. I got access to a modest gym with the most basic equipment, and now that it's getting warmer I'm also open to doing stuff outside. What I *don't* have access to, however, is proper food as I live in a host family as a poor student. I therefore can't afford to buy a lot of fancy food.

Does loseit have some healthy tips as to what what options I got with food, healthy snacks and stuff, and what do do in the gym to reach my goals? :)

TL;DR: 17-year-old girl wants to lose 15 pounds for prom, has access to a basic gym and wants to know if loseit can help her with healthy food options and gym workouts.

This post is a great example of how to ask for help on a subreddit. The user is clear about their goals, provides relevant information about their situation, and shows that they have done some research and are willing to work hard to achieve their goals. They also acknowledge that they may not have access to the best resources, but are willing to make do with what they have.

The user is also respectful and polite, using phrases like "hell-bent on making the dress fit" and "poor student" to show that they are aware of the challenges they are facing. They also use a lighthearted tone, using emojis like ಠ_ಠ to show that they are willing to laugh at themselves and not take themselves too seriously.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to ask for help on a subreddit, and is likely to receive a positive and supportive response from the community.

TITLE: I(15m) want to talk to girl(15f) I have a crush or interest in..but..

POST: Sorry for horrible writing. Not my best work, but I'm tired and I'm about to go to sleep.

I go to a small highschool only for freshman (Also known as a ninth grade center) and There's this girl that caught my eye. I don't know her name because I don't have her for any classes, but we see each other every morning and make eye contact, but never talk. In fact, I don't think I've seen her talk with anybody before. She's bilingual so I'm starting to wonder if bad English is the reason why or if she has no interest in meeting anyone or if she's mute or other reasons. I'm over thinking this, but to explain why I'm over thinking this I should talk about myself a little and continue.

I'm a shy guy.. Like a really shy guy with anxiety and shit i don't want to get into, but I've never really had a lot of friends hardly any my entire life, and always was insecure about myself and didn't want to bother anybody with my presence so yeah I basically am a mess with few friends and I'd like to meet this cute girl and Maybe ask her out if she seems interested.. Though there is a bit of a problem. School is about to end and I can only see her in the mornings for a couple minutes and I feel like I wouldn't have time to introduce myself enough to make her feel comfortable enough to exchange social media to talk outside of school so I don't know what to do or what to say or how to even get the courage to walk up to her, introduce myself and Strike up a conversation without messing up or worse.

Any ideas or tips or like suggestions on what I should say or how to uh basically not fuck up.

P.S highly unlikely but paranoid she's reading this.
P.S.S. throwaway because I'm ashamed that I'm making this because of a simple situation when most things on this thread are serious..

TL;DR: I'm a shy guy with anxiety who has a crush on a girl I see every morning, but I don't know her name or how to approach her. I'm worried about messing up or not having enough time to talk to her before school ends. Any tips or suggestions on what to say or do would be appreciated.

**Responses:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's normal to feel nervous and unsure about approaching someone you're interested in. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

* Start by making eye contact and smiling at her. This can help break the ice and show her that you're friendly and approachable.
* Try to find a common interest or topic to talk about. This could be something as simple as the weather, a recent event, or a shared hobby.
* Keep the conversation light and casual. Avoid putting too much pressure on the conversation or trying to make it too deep.
* If you're feeling anxious, try taking some deep breaths or doing some quick relaxation exercises before approaching her.

Remember, the most important thing is to be yourself and be respectful. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. Just be genuine and friendly, and see where things go.

2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I'm glad you're taking the time to think about how you want to approach this situation. It's great that you're considering her feelings and wanting to make a good impression.

Here's a suggestion: instead of trying to strike up a conversation with her in the morning, why not try to find a way to get to know her better in a more relaxed setting? Maybe you could ask a mutual friend if they know her name or if they've talked to her about anything. Or, if you're feeling brave, you could try to sit with her at lunch or in a study group and get to know her in a more casual setting.

Remember, the goal is to build a connection with her, not to try to impress her or make her like you. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where things go.

3. **u/anonymous123**: OP, I'm a girl and I've been in your shoes before. It can be really tough to muster up the courage to talk to someone you're interested in, especially if you don't know them well.

Here's what I would suggest: take a deep breath, put on your best smile, and just go for it. Introduce yourself, say hello, and see where the conversation goes. It's okay if it doesn't go exactly as planned - the most important thing is that you're being genuine and respectful.

And hey, even if it doesn't work out with this girl, there are plenty of other people out there who might be a great match for you. Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go as planned, and just keep being your awesome self.

4. **u/throwaway456789**: OP, I'm a guy and I've been in your shoes before too. It can be really tough to approach someone you're interested in, especially if you don't know them well.

Here's what I would suggest: try to find a way to get to know her better in a more relaxed setting. Maybe you could ask a mutual friend if they know her name or if they've talked to her about anything.

TITLE: My gf (19) never comes in to the liquor store of a guy we know to buy alcohol. Is this legit? (I'm 19) Note: We live in Michigan, drinking age 21 here.

POST: My gf and I go to the liquor store of a guy we know about once a week, and I usually go in to buy beer or whatever we're drinking. It never really bothered me until recently that she always sits in the car. The guy we know is a mutual friend's friend. I asked her about it a couple of months ago, and she said she just didn't want to get in any trouble. 

At the time, this was somewhat legitimate because she was here on an H-4 visa (her dad is here on an H-1 visa and her status is dependent on him). However, about a month ago, she received her green card. I asked her why she couldn't come in with me to pick out our drinks now and she still says the same thing. 

Naturally, I point out that we would be in the same amount of trouble if we got caught, which we wouldn't anyways since we've been buying consistently for well over a year from this guy. I know there's no sense of both of us risking our necks to get alcohol, but it annoys the shit out of me that she seems to think that I should have to go inside to buy our drinks because she doesn't want to get in trouble. 

I don't mind paying for the drinks since I get paid a lot more than her, but I can't help but feel like she thinks she's more important than me or something because she doesn't mind if I risk my neck to go get alcohol, but she absolutely refuses to even come inside with me.

Input? Advice? What should I say or do? Or just suck it up?

TL;DR: My 19-year-old girlfriend never comes into the liquor store with me, even though we've been buying from the same guy for over a year. She says she doesn't want to get in trouble, but I think it's unfair that I have to go in and get our drinks while she sits in the car. We live in Michigan, where the drinking age is 21. She has a green card now, so it's not like she's worried about her visa status anymore. What should I do?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "Dude, you're 19, she's 19, and you're in Michigan where the drinking age is 21. It's not like you're doing anything illegal. Just tell her you're not going to do it anymore and see how she reacts. If she's really that concerned about getting in trouble, maybe she's not the right person for you."
2. "I think you're overthinking this. She's just being cautious, and you're being a bit dramatic. It's not like she's asking you to do something illegal. Just chill out and let her do what she wants. If it bothers you that much, maybe you should have a conversation with her about it, but don't make a big deal out of it."
3. "I think you're being a bit entitled here. Just because you're willing to take the risk doesn't mean she has to. It's her decision, and you should respect it. If you're really that bothered by it, maybe you should be having a conversation with her about your feelings and boundaries, rather than trying to change her behavior."
4. "I'm a bit surprised you're not more concerned about the fact that she's been lying to you about her reasons for not going into the store. She initially said it was because of her visa status, but now that she has a green card, she's still not willing to go in. That's a pretty big red flag. Maybe you should be having a conversation with her about honesty and trust."
5. "I think you're being a bit too focused on the liquor store thing. Maybe there's something deeper going on here. Is she really that concerned about getting in trouble, or is there something else going on that's making her not want to go into the store? Have you talked to her about it and tried to understand her perspective?"

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my gf [19 F] of 6 months, is it bad of me to reconsider the relationship due to her low sex drive?

POST: Me and my gf met on tinder and have been dating for ~6 months now. The start of the relationship was fun, and best of all was the sex. We both loved it. She was a lot more experienced than I am, she has slept with 8 people where I have only slept with 2 (current gf included) but that was never an issue.

About 2 months into the relationship we both moved cities for university, coincidentally we had both been accepted by the same one and now live just minutes away from eachother, as opposed to the 45 minute drive before hand. But then the relationship changed - she started getting more jealous, we argued a lot and it seemed like we were going to lose eachother but we both stuck through it. 

We had to start searching for a house in the private sector rather than in University accommodation for second and third year study, and I felt like it would be sensible to get separate houses with friends just to be safe, as we are in a new relationship and this was my first'real' relationship, but when I told her she took it as an offence, like I was trying to get away from her. It took me a while to reason with her, and though she still doesn't agree with me, she is accepting of my decision.

We've been going steady for a month or two now without arguing but the relationship is different, there's no spark. We seem to just sit and watch tv, and the sex is down to about once or twice a fortnight. I know that can be classed as the honeymoon stage passing but the sex just feels forced. Like we only do it because we haven't in a while. I have tried a few times to mention that I would like to have more sex but she doesn't seem as enthusiastic. Am I a bad person for saying this? We are happy together but this has been bugging me for a while.

TL;DR: Me and my 19 year old girlfriend have been dating for 6 months, we used to have great sex but it's been down to once or twice a fortnight lately. I've tried to mention it to her but she doesn't seem as enthusiastic. Should I be worried about this or is it just a normal part of the relationship?

**Top Comments:**

* "You're not a bad person for saying this. It's a normal part of relationships to go through ups and downs, and communication is key. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's going through a low-sex-drive phase, or maybe there's something else going on that's causing the decrease in intimacy. Try to approach the conversation without blaming or accusing her, and see if you can find a solution together."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the sex aspect. Relationships are about so much more than just physical intimacy. Have you talked to your girlfriend about what's going on in her life, what's stressing her out, what she's interested in? Maybe there's something going on that's causing her to not be as interested in sex. Try to have a conversation about what's going on in her life, and see if you can find ways to support each other."
* "I think you're being a bit too quick to write off the relationship. You've only been together for 6 months, and relationships take time to develop. It's normal for things to slow down a bit as you get to know each other better. Maybe try to focus on other aspects of the relationship, like your shared interests, your values, and your goals. See if you can find ways to connect with each other on a deeper level."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on your own desires and not enough on your girlfriend's feelings. Have you considered that maybe she's not interested in sex right now because of something going on in her life, or because she's not feeling comfortable with the way things are going in the relationship? Try to have a conversation with her about what she's feeling, and see if you can find a way to support each other."
* "I think you're being a bit too critical of your girlfriend. Everyone has ups and downs in their relationships, and it's normal for things to slow down a bit. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of the relationship, and see if you can find ways to work through the challenges together."

TITLE: What to do about SO's terrible family?

POST: SO (21M) and I (20F) have been together 5 years and talk about marriage somewhat often. We love each other very much and are always happy thinking of our futures together. However, every time I think about our future especially the idea of a wedding, I get worried due to his family. They are emotionally (and on occasion physically) abusive people who take their hatred of each other out on their "unwanted" son. They have caused horrible psychological scarring in my SO and I hate being around them. They've never been very kind/receptive to me and I get terrible anxiety whenever I have to be around them. They are your purest form of white trash. SO knows how awful they are and has frankly said that maybe we should just never tell them if/when we get married. Just wondering if anyone out there has had to deal with a similar situation and how to handle the possibility of a wedding without one of the families involved?

TL;DR: SO's family is emotionally/physically abusive and I'm worried about being around them on our wedding day. Should we just not invite them or is there a way to handle the situation without causing more stress?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, I think it's best to just not invite them. You don't have to justify or explain your decision to anyone. It's your wedding, and you should prioritize your own happiness and well-being. If your SO is okay with not inviting them, then that's a good sign that he's aware of the toxicity and willing to prioritize your feelings too."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I understand your concerns, but it's also important to consider the impact of not inviting them on your SO. He may feel guilty or ashamed about not including his family, even if they are toxic. Maybe you could have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and come up with a compromise? For example, you could invite them to a separate family gathering or event, but not to the actual wedding."
3. **u/anonymous123**: "I've been in a similar situation, and I can tell you that it's not worth the stress and anxiety. My partner's family was also toxic, and we decided not to invite them to our wedding. It was a huge weight off our shoulders, and we were able to focus on our own happiness and celebration. Remember, your wedding is about you and your partner, not about appeasing others."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think it's important to consider the long-term implications of not inviting his family to the wedding. While it may seem like an easy solution in the short term, it could lead to resentment and feelings of guilt or shame down the line. Maybe you could try to have a mediated conversation with his family, where you both express your feelings and concerns, and see if you can find a way to move forward in a positive way."
5. **u/throwaway456**: "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not fair that you have to deal with the emotional fallout of his family's behavior. I think it's best to prioritize your own well-being and focus on your own happiness. If that means not inviting them to the wedding, then so be it. You deserve to celebrate your love and commitment to each other without having to deal with toxic family drama."

TITLE: Reddit. What is your scariest vacation story?

POST: Personally, I recently visited the Bahamas. We did an all-day scooter rental and covered the whole Nassau island...that is until my scooter broke down. I was at one of the private beaches, and asked a bus driver if I could use his phone to call the rental place. He looked me dead in the eye and said "No, but let me tell you something. If you know what's good for you, you'll leave this beach immediately." everyone in the beach was looking at me with wide eyes. Needless to say I rigged a towing system from my buddy's scooter and got the hell out of there.

TL;DR: Broke down on a private beach in the Bahamas, got a creepy vibe from the locals, and had to MacGyver a way to get out of there.

I'm just wondering what the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about is. I'm not asking about white lies or little fibs, but actual, out-and-out, ridiculous lies.

For me, it was when I was 12 and I told my friends that I had a pet snake that was as long as a school bus. I know, I know, it's ridiculous. But I was convinced that it was true at the time and I even drew a picture of it to prove it.

POST: I've always been a bit of a night owl and I've never had trouble falling asleep. However, I've noticed that some of my friends and family members have a really hard time falling asleep. They'll lie awake for hours, stressing about work, relationships, or other things.

I've tried to understand why this is, but I've never really found a clear answer. Is it because of differences in sleep patterns, brain chemistry, or something else entirely?

I'd love to hear from any scientists or experts in the field who can provide some insight into this phenomenon.

TITLE: Need Help Understanding Relationship M[21] with F[21]

POST: Relationship time: 5 months

Hey /relationships,

So I met this girl at OSU earlier this year, and we both fell deeply in love.  This was my first real relationship, and I was smitten completely - I fell hard for her, and she did the same for me.  Now, at around 7 days, she said I love you, and I returned it, for I really thought that I felt that way.  Around 2 months in, we were talking about marriage and getting engaged, and formulating plans together for the future.  

Now here is the issue.  I no longer am sure about getting engaged or married.  I definitely still want to be with her, but I am finally coming to my senses and realizing that 6 months is way, way, Way too soon to get engaged, and that I want to know her for a few years before I am comfortable with being married.  We're just beginning to get to know each other and commit to each other for life right now would just be laying the grounds for a potentially unhappy and unsuccessful marriage.

With all of that being said, I know the general consensus will just be to talk about it, and keep both parties on the same page regarding the relationship, and this is what I would do, if I knew that she wouldn't freak out completely.  She has deep abandonment issues and trust issues which we have been working through together, and I know she would view this as a violation of her trust and love.  I've always assumed honesty is the best policy, but I'm just not sure about what to do in this circumstance.

TL;DR: I'm 21, been in a relationship with a 21-year-old girl for 5 months.  We were talking about marriage and getting engaged, but I'm now having doubts.  I still want to be with her, but I don't think it's too early to get engaged.  I'm worried about how she'll react if I bring it up.

TITLE: Going on a date in an hour.. Super nervous need help

POST: I got out of a bad relationship two months ago that lasted almost a year. I haven't been on a first date for over a year.. I met this girl on Tinder and made it clear I wasn't looking to just hook up. We've been talking and share a lot in common, down to the fact we both smoke pot and love cartoons from the 90's. I've been pretty smooth on the phone but in real life I'm very shy. I think I've gotten a little less shy since I got out of my last relationship, but I really wanna wow this girl. We're going to see the new Fast and Furious movie.  We're both passive people, as I'm very shy and nice and she seems to be just like me in that she doesn't like to be the one making decisions. I don't like making decisions either, but I made the decision of when and what movie to see. What should I do?

TL;DR: Going on a date in an hour, super nervous. Haven't been on a first date in over a year. Want to wow the girl, but I'm shy and we both like to avoid making decisions. What should I do?

REPLIES:

1. "Hey, you're gonna be fine! Just be yourself, relax, and have fun. Remember, it's just a date, not a marriage proposal. Take a few deep breaths, and try to enjoy the movie. If things go well, you can always ask her out again. Good luck!"
2. "I'm glad you're taking the initiative to make plans! Since you both like to avoid making decisions, maybe you can compromise and let her pick the next activity or movie. It's a great way to show you're willing to listen to her and make her feel included. Just be yourself, and don't overthink it too much."
3. "I'm a bit of a introvert too, and I know how hard it can be to be yourself on a date. But honestly, the more you try to be someone you're not, the more likely you are to mess things up. Just relax, be yourself, and let the conversation flow naturally. If you both have a good time, that's all that matters. And hey, if it doesn't work out, there's always the next date!"
4. "I think it's great that you're taking the initiative to plan the date! Since you both like the same things, you can use that as a conversation starter. Ask her about her favorite Fast and Furious movie, or what she thinks about the new one. It's a great way to show you're interested in getting to know her better. Just remember to listen actively and respond thoughtfully. Good luck, and have fun!"
5. "I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, but I think it's great that you're putting yourself out there again. Just remember that it's okay to be nervous, and it's normal to feel a little awkward on a first date. The key is to be yourself, be respectful, and have an open mind. If things go well, you can always ask her out again. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll have learned something new about yourself and gained some confidence. Good luck, and have fun!"

TITLE: My (28/f) girlfriend opened up to me about her past and now I (31/m) feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go and stop judging her. Any advice is appreciated.

POST: An amazing woman entered my life a few months ago. We hit it off right away and have been discovering new facets to our chemistry ever since. It's been mind-blowingly great in just about every way. She is absolutely crazy about me, and I felt the same about her until she recently opened up to me about her past. She told me that she's been with tons of guys, saying that it was often an 'obligation' for having been taken out on a couple dates, that she could easily separate the emotional and physical aspects of sex.

I really feel that I've lost a great deal of respect for her, and I don't fully understand why. I've always associated such feelings with jealousy, insecurity, or mistrust, but this doesn't feel like that to me. It just feels like I think less of her. I want so badly to let it go. She's absolutely incredible in so many ways that are important to me. 

My brain tells me that feeling this way is immature, stupid, and extremely unfair to her. I have a past too. I have no right to expect anything of her before we met. But her past is of the type that I have specifically avoided in my own life, generally feeling that it was a matter of self-respect. I've always thought it was important to reserve sex for meaningful relationships. 

Am I being overly judgmental? Is any part of what I'm feeling rational?

How do I forgive her past? Maybe forgive isn't the right word, because I don't necessarily think she's done anything wrong. But how do I let it go?

TL;DR: My girlfriend opened up to me about her past, and I feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go, but I'm struggling to understand why I feel this way. Help!

---

This post is a great example of how people can struggle with feelings of judgment and disapproval when their partner shares information about their past. The OP (original poster) is torn between his desire to let go of his negative feelings and his sense of discomfort and disapproval.

The post highlights the importance of self-reflection and understanding one's own biases and values. The OP's feelings of disapproval may stem from his own personal values and beliefs about sex and relationships, which were challenged by his girlfriend's openness about her past.

The post also raises questions about the importance of communication and empathy in relationships. The OP's girlfriend may have been sharing her past in an effort to be open and honest with him, but his reaction suggests that he may not have been fully receptive or understanding.

The post has received many comments and responses, with some people offering words of encouragement and support, while others have shared their own experiences and perspectives on the issue. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* The importance of communication and empathy in relationships
* The need to let go of judgment and focus on the present and future
* The recognition that everyone has a past, and that it's okay to have made mistakes or had different experiences
* The importance of self-reflection and understanding one's own biases and values

Overall, this post is a great example of how people can struggle with feelings of judgment and disapproval in their relationships, and how important it is to communicate openly and empathetically with our partners. It also highlights the importance of self-reflection and understanding one's own biases and values.

TITLE: Me [25] with my "exclusive" FWB/GF [27 F] three months... ignoring me while she's out of town for spring break.

POST: Everything was fantastic before she left, like I literally had one of the best times of my life with her early this week. 

The night before she left I asked her if were exclusive, and she asked if I was worried she was going to cheat on the trip. I played it as calm as possible "a girl is going to do what she's going to do,  I can't stop you either way... but I like you and.. blah blah blah..." Although it wasn't fully aired out, the cuddling/kissing combined with "just trust me baby I'm not gonna hurt you..." talk made me feel like we were. 

IDK, I thought we were cool We had sex since I asked her that...  then she went out of town and I haven't heard from her since day one. 

Like she sent me a trivial  text, I responded 5 minutes later, then didn't get anything else for over 24 hours, when I texted her again... a "what'sup, having fun".

No response, going on three days now since I last heard from her Tuesday morning.

I don't text her again right? It would be too clingy? Is it time to start assuming the worse?  

Would a "are you okay...?" kind of text leaning on I'm worried for her safety be a good thing to try?

TL;DR: Girlfriend/FWb of three months ignores me while out of town for spring break, after we had an amazing time before she left and I thought we were exclusive. Should I text her again or assume the worst?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you're being way too clingy. Give her space. If she's not responding, it's probably because she's having fun without you. Don't text her again, just wait it out.
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: I agree with throwaway123456. You need to respect her boundaries and give her space. If she's not responding, it's not because she's having fun without you, it's because she's not interested in talking to you right now. Don't assume the worst, just wait and see what happens when she gets back.
3. **SkepticalSarah**: I'm a woman, and I have to say, this sounds like a classic case of "I'm not interested in you, but I don't want to hurt your feelings, so I'm just going to ignore you." If you're not getting any responses, it's probably because she's not interested in you. Don't text her again, just move on.
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: I think you should try sending her a "are you okay...?" kind of text. It's a nice gesture, and it shows you care about her safety. If she's not responding, then you can assume the worst. But if she does respond, it might give you a chance to clear the air and figure out what's going on.
5. **RealTalk**: Honestly, dude, you're being way too invested in this situation. You're only three months in, and you're already assuming you're exclusive. Take a step back, and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really that invested in this relationship, or are you just trying to fill a void? If it's the latter, then maybe you should just focus on yourself and your own happiness instead of trying to cling to someone who's clearly not interested.

TITLE: [PA] Serving an "underager" as a Bartender

POST: I'm a bartender at a restaurant/bar which can get pretty busy on friday night.  So, we have a bouncer who cards everyone at the door.  As he is the one in charge of this process, I'm assuming, probably incorrectly, that he assumes liability for anyone allowed in underage. This carding includes looking at the IDs as well as swiping.  PA IDs, or so I'm told, are generally difficult to fake so if he gives them the okay, I don't usually double check.  

Apparently, two girls came in one Friday night and the one was underage.  We only discovered this because the girl's father came in and was complaining that she got served because she's only 20.  Assuming he reports this, what kind of legal trouble could I be looking at?

TL;DR: I'm a bartender in PA, we card at the door, and I'm wondering what kind of legal trouble I could face if I served an underage person.

---

**Legal Advice**

**tl;dr:** As a bartender in PA, you could face legal trouble, including fines and even criminal charges, for serving an underage person. It's important to note that the bouncer's assumption of liability is not a valid defense.

**Full Response:**

As a bartender in PA, it's your responsibility to ensure that you're not serving anyone who is underage. While the bouncer may have carded the girls at the door, it's still your responsibility to verify their age before serving them.

If you're found to have served an underage person, you could face legal trouble, including fines and even criminal charges. In PA, the penalty for serving an underage person can range from a fine of up to $1,000 to a maximum of 30 days in jail.

It's also important to note that the bouncer's assumption of liability is not a valid defense. As the bartender, you are ultimately responsible for ensuring that you're not serving anyone who is underage.

To avoid legal trouble, it's important to always verify the age of anyone who is trying to order a drink. You can do this by asking for their ID and checking it yourself, rather than relying on the bouncer to do it.

Additionally, it's a good idea to have a system in place for handling situations like this. This could include having a protocol for what to do if someone is found to be underage, and making sure that all staff members are aware of the policy.

In summary, as a bartender in PA, it's your responsibility to ensure that you're not serving anyone who is underage. While the bouncer may have carded the girls at the door, it's still your responsibility to verify their age before serving them. If you're found to have served an underage person, you could face legal trouble, including fines and even criminal charges. It's important to always verify the age of anyone who is trying to order a drink, and to have a system in place for handling situations like this.

TITLE: Single again and lonely :/

POST: I realized today that I (21 f) seriously have an issue with dependency. My ex bf (26 m) broke up with me about 2 weeks ago. It was a LDR and kind of feels like we broke up for no reason. I went to visit regularly but I suppose it wasn't enough for him. It hurts even more because we haven't kept in contact even though we're "Friends." We were only together for about 9 months if you count the period of time we started talking. Right before getting into that relationship, I was with another guy (22 m) for about 3 years. We also don't keep in contact.  And before that, I was kind of with a guy (23 m) that was in jail for about a year. Basically, I haven't been completely single in 4+ years. How do I get my mind off my exs and guys in general? I don't really want a relationship anytime soon. Was considering a fwb but I feel like I deserve more than just being someone's fuckbuddy. I don't really have friends so I feel stuck. What should I do?

TL;DR: I'm 21, single again after 4+ years, and feeling lonely. I have issues with dependency and don't know how to get my mind off my exs. I don't want a relationship anytime soon, but I feel stuck and don't have friends. Help!

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough to break free from the pattern of being in a relationship. First of all, congratulations on recognizing your dependency issues! That's a huge step. As for getting your mind off your exs, try focusing on self-care. Take up a new hobby, join a club or group that aligns with your interests, and prioritize your own well-being. You don't need a relationship to be happy. And honestly, FWB might not be the best idea right now. You deserve more than just physical intimacy. Take your time, focus on yourself, and the right person will come along when you're ready."
2. **u/lonelyheart**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling lonely. It's tough to be single again, especially when you're used to being in a relationship. But trust me, you're not alone. There are plenty of people out there who are going through the same thing. Have you considered joining a social club or group that aligns with your interests? That way, you can meet new people who share similar passions. And don't worry about not having friends - you'll make new ones in time. Just be patient and focus on yourself. You got this!"
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to take time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. You don't need to rush into a new relationship or FWB situation. Take your time, and when you're ready, you'll know. In the meantime, try to focus on the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. And don't worry about your exs - they're not worth your time and energy. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to keep in contact with you."
4. **u/sassy_sarah**: "OP, honey, you need to get out of your own head! You're not stuck, you're just taking a break from relationships. And honestly, that's a good thing. You need to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. Don't worry about what others think - you do you, boo! Take some time to travel, try new things, and get to know yourself better. And when you're ready, you'll know. Just remember, you're not alone, and there are plenty of people out there who are going through the same thing."

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my (friends with benefits?) [18 F] confused.

POST: So let me start off by saying I've been "seeing" this girl for about two weeks. She's sweet, a total tomboy, and she's real cool. Now normally I fall head over heels for girls, but after our first date she made it clear she wasn't necessarily looking to date. Fine by me, I'm in a phase of my life where I'm fine without a girlfriend, but the problem is I'm a virgin and plan to stay so (until I find someone I love enough to give it away). That makes hookups difficult. This girl has slept over on weekends, and I've gone out drinking with her friends, it's a good time, but I'm realizing now that I kind of want a relationship. It doesn't have to be with her, but I care about her, and she had one of those drunk spill all moments the other night. She basically said that she cares about me way too much and wants a relationship but is scared and so she'll never date me. She said however she would date me if we eventually had sex. This scared the crap out of me. If you like me, date me because you like me, not because you want my sex. It's so confusing.

On top of this, there are two girls who I know for a fact would love for me to ask them out. I could do this as I don't have any immediate attachments to the girl I'm fwb'ing with (if you can call it that), and they're both definitely looking for a relationship. It's strange because I usually fall head over heels for the girls I'm seeing very quickly, but this time it's been different. I'm just really confused. I think I'm going through a phase or something. Thanks guys. Appreciate help in advance.

-Kirby1056

TL;DR: 20M has been seeing an 18F for 2 weeks, they're friends with benefits, but he's realizing he wants a relationship. She's scared of commitment and only wants to date him if they have sex. He's torn between pursuing her and asking out other girls who are looking for a relationship. He's confused and seeking advice.

TITLE: Interested in my ex's good friend

POST: I dated a girl who we'll call Jane for 8 months and was very in love with her. To make a long story short, over the summer we broke up and I was devastated but, as is part of life, I had to move on. So I started talking to other people and the one person in specific I started talking to was her friend - let's call her Nicole. So Nicole and I got to talking a lot and rather quickly I became really interested in her. So one day, I invited her over to my house thinking that we would just hang out as friends because that's all I really thought of it but things started getting pretty flirty. I brought attention to a vodka bottle I had in the cabinet twice not for the purpose of convincing her to drink some with me but just pointing it out. The second time she suggest we have some so we did. We both got a bit tipsy and nearly kissed but instead both decided that on account of Jane that would not be a good idea for either of us because I admittedly still had feelings for Jane. Despite this decision, I continued flirting with Nicole and she continued flirting with me. We started hanging out a lot and cuddling and doing essentially anything but actually kissing. Again, to make a long story short, over the past few months we've hung out a lot and flirted a lot and cuddled but we keep getting stopped by something. Despite knowing that this thing is Jane I decided to ask Nicole today. So we went for a walk and talked and she said that if it were not for Jane she would definitely be interested in me but that she can't do that to Jane. I want to have something more than a friendship with Nicole but because of my relationship with Jane which, to restate, she ended Nicole doesn't see that happening. I basically want to know if there is anything I could do to convince Nicole otherwise.

TL;DR: I'm interested in my ex's good friend, we've been flirting and hanging out, but she says she can't pursue anything because of her loyalty to my ex. I want to know if there's anything I can do to change her mind.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT**

* **Don't pursue a relationship with someone who is loyal to your ex**: "You need to respect Nicole's decision and not try to convince her to pursue something with you. It's not fair to her or to Jane, and it could damage your friendship with both of them."
* **Focus on your own healing and growth**: "Instead of trying to convince Nicole to be with you, focus on your own healing and growth. Take time to reflect on your feelings and what you want in a relationship. You might find that you're not ready for a new relationship or that you need to work on yourself before you're ready."
* **Communicate with Nicole and respect her boundaries**: "Have an open and honest conversation with Nicole about your feelings and boundaries. Respect her decision if she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with you, and don't pressure her or try to convince her otherwise."
* **Consider taking a break from Nicole**: "If you're not respecting Nicole's boundaries and trying to convince her to be with you, it might be best to take a break from her. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and respect Nicole's decision."
* **Reflect on why you're pursuing Nicole**: "Take some time to reflect on why you're pursuing Nicole. Are you doing it because you genuinely have feelings for her, or are you doing it because you're trying to fill a void left by your breakup with Jane? Make sure you're being honest with yourself and that you're not using Nicole as a rebound or a distraction."

**ADDITIONAL COMMENTS**

* "I think you're being pretty selfish in this situation. You're trying to convince Nicole to pursue a relationship with you despite her loyalty to your ex. That's not fair to her or to Jane."
* "I understand that you're interested in Nicole, but you need to respect her decision if she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with you. It's not about you, it's about her and her feelings."
* "You need to take responsibility for your own emotions and actions. You can't blame Nicole for not wanting to pursue a relationship with you. You need to focus on your own healing and growth."
* "I think you're trying to use Nicole as a way to get over your ex. That's not healthy or respectful. You need to focus on yourself and your own emotional well-being."
* "You need to communicate with Nicole and respect her boundaries. If she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with you, that's okay. You need to respect her decision and move on."

TITLE: my SO [f/21] was talking to another guy and lied to me. what is a fair response/continued actions?

POST: My SO and I live together. together for about a year. SO has had a friend who she claimed to be nothing more than a friend. I have meet him and he seemed like a nice enough guy. For a time she talked to him all the time to the point of neglecting me. I confronted her about how I feel and the problem seemed to be done. but i never fully trusted their interactions. A few days ago he sent her a text and I read it. Leading me to read the rest only to find that they have been sexting back and forth with a lot of detail. I don't know how long this has been going on. The only redeeming fact was that they never talked about cheating. My SO and I had just had a great week where we had found a whole new level of trust(Opening up about our sexuality etc.) So naturally I feel hurt and betrayed etc. In trying to show that I could still trust her I told her that they could still talk as friend. We are working on it and I forgave her. She is doing a much better job than I expected trying to show me how much she loves me and that it was just stupid text that went to far. But i can't stop wondering what they are talking about? Am I in the wrong to ask to see their text's back and forth? I don't know if i'm Overeating to this whole thing and obsessing or I'm right to be so paranoid about them. thanks reddit.

TL;DR: SO was talking to another guy, lied about it, and they were sexting. I forgave her, but I'm still hurt and paranoid. Should I ask to see their texts?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're being too understanding. Forgiving her for sexting with someone else is a big ask. You deserve better than that. I would suggest having a serious conversation with her about what you're comfortable with and what boundaries you need her to respect. Don't be afraid to set clear expectations and consequences if those boundaries are crossed again."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous comment. Forgiveness is great, but it's also important to acknowledge the hurt and betrayal you've experienced. It's okay to be upset and it's okay to set boundaries. You don't have to forgive and forget. You can forgive and still have a conversation about what happened and what you need from your partner moving forward."
3. **u/paranoidpenguin**: "I'm not saying you're wrong to be paranoid, but you need to trust your partner to some extent. If you're constantly questioning their actions and motives, it's going to create a toxic environment. You need to have open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings and concerns. And if you're still feeling uneasy, it might be worth considering couples therapy to work through these issues."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being too lenient. Sexting with someone else is a huge red flag. You deserve better than someone who is willing to compromise your relationship like that. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this relationship is healthy for you. You deserve someone who respects and prioritizes your feelings and boundaries."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're trying to show that you can still trust your partner, and that's admirable. But it's also okay to acknowledge your feelings and concerns. You don't have to forgive and forget, but you can work through this together. Remember that relationships are about growth and communication. You can work through this and come out stronger on the other side."

**Conclusion:** The top comments on this post are divided on whether the OP is being too understanding or too harsh on their SO. Some commenters suggest that forgiveness is important, but also acknowledge the hurt and betrayal that has occurred. Others suggest that the OP is being too lenient and that sexting with someone else is a huge red flag. Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what they are comfortable with and what boundaries they need their SO to respect. It's also important for the OP to communicate openly and honestly with their SO about their feelings and concerns. Couples therapy may also be a good option to work through these issues.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my girlfriend [26 F] of 3.5 years has been supporting me financially and emotionally since losing my job a few months ago. How can I show her how much I appreciate her?

POST: Today was a tough day in particular, after waiting three months on what I thought was a very positive interview, I realized I did not get an offer to my top choice of jobs. I have been applying to many jobs, as many as I can, with a few bites but nothing especially promising. We didn't know me being unemployed would last this long, which has been taxing on both of us.

My girlfriend has been here for me: financially, emotionally, and everything in between. I know it must get frustrating for her, especially after so many negatives on my job front. I clean around the apartment, go grocery shopping, do laundry, and do my best to make sure she comes home after work and is able to relax. 

How can I show her how much I care about her, and how much I appreciate everything that she's done and is doing for me? I want her to know, especially after being dealt this particularly huge blow. Lord knows she deserves to feel special.

TL;DR: I've been unemployed for a few months, and my girlfriend has been supporting me financially and emotionally. I want to show her how much I appreciate her efforts, especially after a tough day.

TITLE: [25/F] getting married, bridesmaid [25/F] won't get back to me!

POST: Hello,

So I [25/F] am getting married in about 2 months. I had planned to have 3 bridesmaids and a maid of honor. However, one of my bridesmaids [25/F] has been really out of the loop (not answering calls/texts/emails/fb messages). This was also the case when I was trying to ask her to be a bridesmaid (a process which took months to get in touch with her!). My fiancé and I recently moved to another state, so most of our people from our wedding party are from out of town (which I understand limits what they can do to help); however, all my bridal party have gotten matching dresses (of different shades of blue) and she still hasn't even responded to any of their messages either. She always comes up with lame excuses (her phone broke/ she got a new computer- which SHE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO CHECK FB MESSAGES AND EMAILS!). 

She has been a very close friend since we were young (since 11 years old!). I love her to death and we have always had the kind of relationship were we don't need to talk or hang out every weekend to be able to maintain our friendship (we have always been there for any crisis and told each other everything even after months of not talking). I feel like she is really dropping the ball on this tough… It's not like I'm asking her to help with ANY PREPARATIONS for the wedding, just get ANY dress that is blue... I would even help financially but she doesn't respond to ANYTHING.

I have thought about asking her to step down because I find it really rude of her BUT HOW if I can't even get in touch with her?! I am also scared about messing up the friendship… but… I think she already has.

TL;DR: Bridesmaid won't get back to me, won't respond to messages, and I'm getting married in 2 months. What do I do?!

**Reddit's Response:**

* **Comment 1:** "Honestly, it sounds like she's not interested in being a part of your wedding party. It's not about you, it's about her. You've given her plenty of chances to respond and she's blown them off. It's okay to accept that and move on. You don't need to stress about it anymore."
* **Comment 2:** "I would suggest having a calm and honest conversation with her. Let her know how you're feeling and how her lack of response is affecting you. It's possible she's going through a tough time and doesn't know how to reach out. But if she still doesn't respond after that, it's okay to reassign the role or ask her to step down."
* **Comment 3:** "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You've given her plenty of chances to respond and she's blown them off. It's not about you, it's about her. You don't need to stress about it anymore. Just focus on your wedding and the people who are actually supporting you."
* **Comment 4:** "I would suggest having a backup plan in case she doesn't show up or doesn't respond. You don't want to be left with a bunch of last-minute stress. Also, consider having a conversation with her about how her lack of response is affecting you. It's possible she's not aware of how her actions are impacting you."
* **Comment 5:** "I think you should prioritize your own feelings and well-being. If you're feeling stressed and anxious about this, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. You don't need to put up with someone who's not respecting your boundaries or your wedding. You deserve better."

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community offers a range of advice, from being understanding and giving the bridesmaid the benefit of the doubt to being more direct and setting boundaries. Some commenters suggest having a calm and honest conversation with the bridesmaid, while others recommend having a backup plan in case she doesn't show up or respond. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP to decide how to handle the situation and prioritize their own feelings and well-being.

TITLE: My girlfriend is turning 21 and wants me (21M) to throw her a party. How do I break the news that no one will show up?

POST: Birthdays have always been hard on my girlfriend.  She's had a few parties as a child where no one showed up, and since moving states in the middle of high school she hasn't made close friends.

Here at college, she tries hard to make friends. She talks well to people on a superficial basis but doesn't have any real friends.  She's never been invited to a college party and has often missed out on many typical activities.

We've been together for 3 years, since freshman orientation.  I don't have friends but I'm happy that way.  I like keeping to myself if I'm not spending time with her.  Since she's naturally extroverted, she spends her free time with me, or at club meetings trying to connect to people.  

She's asked if I could put together a small party so I invited some acquaintances, my roommates, etc.  everyone said no.  I gave the invites well in advance too.  I don't know how to break the news to my girlfriend, she's been so excited.  She thought providing free food and drink would be a great way to make friends.  But people don't want to come for even that.  What can I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend is turning 21 and wants me to throw her a party. I invited acquaintances and roommates, but everyone said no. How do I break the news to her that no one will show up?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not your fault that no one wants to come to the party. It's not uncommon for people to be hesitant to attend parties, especially if they don't know the birthday person well. You could try explaining to your girlfriend that you invited people, but they declined. You could also offer to do something else special with her on her birthday, like going out for dinner or a movie. That way, she'll still have a special day, even if the party doesn't happen."
2. **u/sadpanda1990**: "I think it's great that you're trying to make your girlfriend happy, but maybe it's time to have a conversation with her about her expectations. It's not realistic to expect people to show up to a party just because there's free food and drink. You could also suggest doing something low-key, like having a movie night or playing games together. That way, you can still celebrate her birthday together, but in a way that's more intimate and meaningful."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being really sweet by trying to throw her a party, but maybe it's time to focus on what she really wants. Does she really want a big party, or is she just trying to fit in with what she thinks others want? Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and see what she really wants. You could also suggest doing something that's more meaningful to her, like a special activity or outing that you can do together."

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys. I think you're right, I should have a conversation with her about her expectations. I'll try to explain to her that I invited people, but they declined, and that it's not uncommon for parties to not be well-attended. I'll also suggest doing something low-key, like having a movie night or playing games together. I just want to make her happy and feel special on her birthday, so I'll try to find a way to do that that works for both of us."

TITLE: My [18F] "girlfriend" is acting pretty weird with me [18M] lately

POST: Hey Reddit! Over the past week or so my SO of 6 months has been acting pretty out of the norm with me... We normally always say goodnight before bed and say we love each other but this past week it just hasn't really happened, I've said it but it's not been reciprocated at all. On top of this there's been this guy she's been talking to [26M] who she says used to be nice but then got weird and sends her nudes all the time but she has never told him to leave her alone. As well as that, she doesn't like being known as my girlfriend or that I'm her boyfriend even though we do all the stuff, spend time together, go on dates etc. But she changes so much around our friends, and this has not just been recently this has been since we started speaking to each other. This comes then today, she was at my house and she tried to initiate sex, after messaging the guy, I said no because I thought something had happened in the messages but she insists all the time that he's the only one being weird. Shortly after I apologised because I didn't want it to seem like I didn't want her and then she broke down crying saying that it was because she was gonna miss me a lot when she went to uni, but the thing is that she's never done anything like it before, whenever I've been upset she's always been comforting and said that we'd still see each other, so that prompted me to think further that something had been said in the messages and she'd acknowledged that I realised. She's now at home and flaming me for apologising and wanting a reason to initiate it, when before she did, nothing was going on, I'd went to get us a drink and we'd actually had sex about 2 hours before and both gotten off. I'm really confused about what's going on, please help.

TL;DR: My 6-month-old SO has been acting weird, not saying goodnight, not reciprocating "I love you"s, talking to a guy who sends nudes, doesn't like being known as my girlfriend, and initiated sex at my house after messaging the guy. I'm confused and worried about what's going on.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can help individuals navigate complex and potentially toxic relationships. The OP (original poster) is clearly concerned about the changes in their SO's behavior and is seeking advice on what might be going on.

Some possible red flags in this situation include:

1. The SO's reluctance to acknowledge their relationship: The OP mentions that their SO doesn't like being known as their girlfriend, which could be a sign of discomfort or even shame about the relationship.
2. The SO's behavior around their friends: The OP notes that their SO changes their behavior around their friends, which could indicate that they are hiding something or trying to present a different image.
3. The SO's interactions with the guy who sends nudes: The OP mentions that their SO has been talking to this guy and that he sends nudes, which could be a sign of emotional manipulation or even abuse.
4. The SO's sudden change in behavior: The OP notes that their SO's behavior has changed significantly over the past week, which could indicate that something is going on that they are not telling the OP.

Some possible advice that could be given to the OP includes:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your SO: The OP should try to have a calm and rational conversation with their SO about their concerns and see if they can get to the bottom of what's going on.
2. Set boundaries: The OP should consider setting boundaries around their relationship, such as not initiating sex or not engaging in certain behaviors that make them uncomfortable.
3. Seek support: The OP should consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help them navigate this situation and make decisions about their relationship.
4. Consider seeking outside help: If the OP is concerned about their SO's behavior or if they feel like they are in an abusive relationship, they should consider seeking help from a professional counselor or therapist.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication and boundaries in relationships, and the need for individuals to prioritize their own emotional well-being and safety.

TITLE: Me [36F] with my "bff" [37F] She moved away and she always flakes on me when she's in town visiting other people.

POST: She and I have been friends since we were 8 or 9 years old. We went through a lot together and were even roommates for a few years and then she moved away.

Since she moved away, she has been consistently flaking out on me after saying she wants to see me, with all sorts of random reasons for doing so. When I had addressed this in the past, I was accused of being selfish and living in a bubble, whatever that's supposed to mean.

We reconciled a few months ago after she had taken my abusive mom's side during an argument we had, and she later apologized after someone else did the same to her. I really thought that things would get better, but in the past few months, she's been in town twice, left me for last in her planning and then - you guessed it - flaked on me. AGAIN.

My question is: should I just give up on this friendship? I'm so tired and hurt by this behaviour, and don't even know if she actually gives a shit about me, or what? Tired of getting my hopes up just to have them dashed an umpteenth time.

TL;DR: Long-time friend moved away, always flakes on me when she's in town, accused me of being selfish and living in a bubble when I address this. Should I just give up on the friendship?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not making an effort to prioritize your friendship. If she's consistently flaking on you, it's probably time to reevaluate the friendship and consider distancing yourself."
* "I think you're being too patient. You deserve better than someone who consistently flakes on you. It's not about being selfish, it's about respecting your time and feelings."
* "I agree with the others, it sounds like she's not making an effort to prioritize your friendship. But before you give up, maybe try having an open and honest conversation with her about how her flaking is affecting you. Maybe she's not even aware of the impact she's having."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not being selfish, you're just tired of being hurt. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. Maybe try setting some boundaries with her and see how she responds."
* "I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with her about how her flaking is affecting you. Maybe she's going through a tough time and doesn't realize the impact she's having. But if she continues to flake, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
* "I think you're being too patient. You deserve better than someone who consistently flakes on you. It's not about being selfish, it's about respecting your time and feelings. Maybe try setting some boundaries with her and see how she responds." (This comment was repeated multiple times)

**Conclusion:** The majority of the comments agree that the OP should reevaluate the friendship and consider distancing themselves from someone who consistently flakes on them. Some comments suggest having an open and honest conversation with the friend to try to resolve the issue, while others suggest setting boundaries and prioritizing the OP's own needs. The comments also emphasize that the OP is not being selfish, but rather tired of being hurt and deserves better treatment from their friend. Overall, the subreddit community seems to be in agreement that the OP should prioritize their own well-being and consider ending the friendship if the behavior continues.

TITLE: He says he's happy, but he knows I'm not what he wants

POST: Hey guys, 

I'm in a tricky situation.

I'm with a guy right now and we have a lot of fun together and we never fight and we have a great time together usually. 

He told me that he's happy with me right now and he's not sure how long it will last but he knows I'm not the kind of person he wants to marry one day... it really hurts. I feel like I'm not good enough. 

One day he asked me if I loved him, and I told him I do and when I asked if he loved me he said No. 

It was devastating. Am I self inflicting myself with this relationship? I love spending time with him. We laugh a lot... I'm hoping that if I can just show him the person I am that his feelings will change maybe and one day he'll realize I'm the one? 

I'm not saying I want to marry him, either. We havn't been together for very long but I do enjoy the time I have with him right now a lot. Am I just overthinking about the future? I go into relationships not wanting to waste my time - I'm looking for someone to love for the rest of my life... I hate jumping around. Soooo... am I just overreacting the future or should I step back from this thinking of "am I/will I ever be good enough?".. We're both very honest with eachother a lot and he shows symptoms of aspergers syndrome (I think he has it?) so I'm usually very blunt/honest with him as well as he is to me.

TL;DR: Guy says he's happy with me, but knows I'm not what he wants long-term. He doesn't love me back, but we have a lot of fun together. Should I stay or go?

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not invested in the relationship and is just enjoying the present moment. If he's not willing to work towards a future together, it's probably best to reevaluate the relationship and prioritize your own happiness."
* "I think you're overthinking this. He's being honest with you, and you're being honest with him. If you're happy in the present, why not enjoy it and see where it takes you? But don't delude yourself into thinking he'll change his mind about the future."
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about what you're feeling. Be honest and open about your concerns, and see how he responds. If he's not willing to work on the relationship or consider your feelings, it might be time to reevaluate."
* "I think you're being too focused on the future and not enough on the present. You said you have a lot of fun together and never fight. Enjoy that and don't worry too much about what might happen in the future. But also don't ignore your feelings and concerns."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about what you want from this relationship. Are you happy with the present moment, or are you holding out hope for something more? If you're happy with the present, maybe it's okay to just enjoy it and not worry too much about the future. But if you're holding out hope for something more, maybe it's time to reevaluate and prioritize your own happiness."

TITLE: You shall not pass!

POST: I was driving home from work in San Antonio when I noticed this jerk in a sports car tailgating, honking, flashing lights, and in general being a major pest. We pulled up to a red light and he gunned it right through the intersection, somehow managing to not cause a major accident. I fumed for a bit but figured that was the end of it.

Ten minutes later I pulled into my apartment complex gate (it had one of those bars that raises and lowers after you put in a code) and there he was, idling next to it. I don't know if he was just visiting so didn't have the right entry numbers or what, but he was just waiting for someone to come in so he could slip by on their pass.

I pulled up to the gate, put my code in, and saw him inches from my bumper waiting to race in behind me. The gate raised up, I went forward, he followed intently, and I stopped with my rear bumper just barely in front of where the gate would fall.

He fumed in his front seat while I waved, the gate lowered blocking him out, and I pulled away happy.

TL;DR: Tailgater gets blocked by my apartment gate. Petty revenge.

---

This post is a great example of petty revenge, as the OP (original poster) takes a moment to exact revenge on the tailgater who had been harassing them earlier. The OP uses the situation to block the tailgater from entering the apartment complex, effectively foiling their plans and getting the last laugh. The post is relatable, entertaining, and showcases the OP's cleverness and sense of humor.

The post also highlights the importance of not taking things too seriously and finding ways to have fun and exact revenge in a harmless and non-confrontational manner. The OP's actions are not aggressive or harmful, but rather a playful way to assert their dominance and show the tailgater that they won't be pushed around.

Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of lighthearted and humorous content that can be found on the r/pettyrevenge subreddit. It's a fun and entertaining way to share stories of petty revenge and connect with others who enjoy similar experiences.

TITLE: Hey, r/loseit, what are our thoughts on supplementary pills like Slimquick or other "diet enhancers"?

POST: I know, I know. Eat healthy, exercise, and you'll be fine. Your weight will plateau sometimes but you'll just have to get over it (literally). Do your best, cut carbs, make life changes.

I've done those. I'm still working on them. But I was wondering if any of you have tried any supplementary diet pills (like Slimquick) and what you guys think of them. Do you think they would help? I'm particularly interested in them giving me some extra motivation - a reason to look back on the day and be like, "Well, you don't need to eat any more today - and that pill will help you even more!" sort of motivation.

What do you think? Any of you have experience with Slimquick or others? Please let me know, I've been debating this for a few weeks and I think I could use the pills as motivators. Or I'll just be out 20 - 30 bucks.

TL;DR: I'm looking for opinions on supplementary diet pills like Slimquick. Do they work? Are they worth it? Any experience with them?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I've tried Slimquick before and it didn't do anything for me. I mean, I didn't gain any weight or anything, but I didn't lose any either. It's just a placebo effect, in my opinion. You're better off focusing on your diet and exercise.
2. **u/fitnessfreak99**: I've tried a few different diet pills and I can tell you that they're all a scam. They might give you a temporary energy boost or suppress your appetite, but they're not going to help you lose weight in the long run. You need to focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes, not relying on pills.
3. **u/slimdownsarah**: I've been taking Slimquick for a few weeks now and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. I've lost 5 pounds and I feel more energetic and motivated. Of course, I'm also eating healthy and exercising regularly, but I think the pill has definitely helped me stay on track. Just be sure to follow the instructions and don't overdo it.
4. **u/loseitlegend**: I've tried a few different diet pills and I can tell you that they're all a waste of money. You're better off focusing on your diet and exercise, and then you'll see real results. Don't waste your money on pills that promise the world but deliver nothing.
5. **u/healthyliving101**: I'm a big believer in the power of supplements, but I think it's important to do your research and find a reputable brand. Slimquick is a well-known brand, but I've heard mixed reviews. If you're considering trying it, make sure you talk to your doctor first and do your research on the ingredients and potential side effects.

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are mixed, with some users expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of diet pills like Slimquick, while others have had positive experiences with them. The general consensus seems to be that while diet pills may provide a temporary energy boost or appetite suppression, they are not a substitute for a healthy diet and regular exercise. It's also important to do your research and talk to your doctor before trying any new supplements. Ultimately, the best way to achieve weight loss and overall health is through a combination of healthy habits and a balanced lifestyle.

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [18F] recently found out her last boyfriend was cheating on her the entire time. I feel like a consolation suddenly.

POST: So my better half recently found her last boyfriend was cheating on her. This guy broke up with her by text and flaked on her constantly for 75% of the relationship (from what she told me) and she was suspicious of cheating the whole time. 

Since they broke up (January or so) he completely ignores her unless he asks for nudes/tries to hook up. 

But even so while they were dating she was desperate for his attention and validation. She recognized what she was doing sticking around was not healthy but she did it anyway. Really liked the guy. That's important information.

Anyway, so when she found out the other day that for the entire time he was seeing other people she got really down. Think it's entirely her fault. I'm trying to be supportive; being cheated on sucks. I've been telling her she's not to blame at all, etc etc. 

I've wondered why she picks up his calls when he tries to "apologize" (from what she told me he says it wasn't that big of a deal and she should give him a second chance) and I've asked her why she doesn't just delete him. She says she does but hours later she unblocks him or whatever. 

But what really *really* gets me is that he said he wants to redo last year and treat her right. She allegedly shoots him down and says she moved on to better things but it is driving me up the got-damn wall knowing he's trying to get her back under his thumb again.

Am I going bananas or is this something I should genuinely be concerned about?

TL;DR: My girlfriend's ex is trying to get back with her after cheating on her and she's still talking to him. I'm worried about her and feel like I'm being replaced as the "consolation prize".

---

This post is a great example of how a partner can unintentionally perpetuate unhealthy behaviors in their significant other. The OP is trying to be supportive, but his concerns and reactions are rooted in his own insecurities and biases.

The OP's girlfriend is still dealing with the emotional aftermath of being cheated on, and her actions may seem irrational or self-destructive to the OP. However, it's essential to understand that her behavior is likely a coping mechanism or a way to regain a sense of control in her life.

The OP's concerns about being replaced as the "consolation prize" are valid, but he should focus on having an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and worries. It's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, rather than accusation or blame.

Some potential questions the OP could ask his girlfriend include:

* How are you feeling about your ex's attempts to get back in touch with you?
* What do you think is driving your desire to engage with him, even if it's just to shut him down?
* How can I support you in moving on from this experience and focusing on our relationship?

By having these conversations and actively listening to his girlfriend's responses, the OP can work together to address her emotional needs and strengthen their relationship. It's essential to recognize that healing from trauma and emotional abuse takes time, and it's crucial to prioritize empathy and understanding in the process.

TITLE: Should I cut deeply into my savings and pay off my student loan or keep paying in increments?

POST: I have ~11K in savings and a remaining balance of ~3K in student loans with a seemingly steep interest rate.  Even though I am 'paid ahead' until July of 2016, I am still incurring interest hits with each payment (generally pay $100/month towards the loan and about 87 goes towards principal and the remaining is interest).  Should I go ahead and pay off my remaining balance of 3K now, leaving me with 8K in savings?

Things to consider: I just moved across the country for grad school.  I am currently unemployed and seeking work.  I can (and probably will have to) take another loan out for grad school in the next two months.  So I wouldn't be flat broke if any major expenses came up.   The only main concerns I have to worry about (aside from standard bills and insurance) are rent of ~625/mo, a dog who is now 7, and a 1999 car which seems to be surviving ok right now, but who knows.

TL;DR: Should I cut into my savings to pay off my student loan or keep paying in increments?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I would recommend paying off the student loan. The interest rate is likely to be higher than what you can earn on your savings, so you're essentially throwing money away by keeping it in savings. Additionally, having a smaller savings buffer can be a good motivator to find a job and get back on your feet."
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I agree with throwaway123456. Paying off the student loan will free up more money in your budget for other expenses and give you a sense of accomplishment. You can always rebuild your savings once you're back on your feet. And who knows, you might find a job that pays more than you expected and you'll be glad you paid off the loan."
3. **u/savvy_spender**: "I would suggest a compromise. Instead of paying off the entire loan, consider paying off the interest-only portion of the loan. This will stop the interest from accruing and give you some breathing room. You can then focus on finding a job and rebuilding your savings. Once you're back on your feet, you can continue making payments on the principal."
4. **u/gradschoolstruggles**: "I'm in a similar situation and I'm considering doing the same thing. I think it's worth considering the opportunity cost of keeping that money in savings. If you're not earning much interest on it, is it really worth keeping it there? On the other hand, if you're not sure when you'll find a job, it might be better to keep some savings buffer. I'm still undecided, but I think it's worth weighing the pros and cons."
5. **u/financial_planner**: "I would recommend paying off the student loan, but also consider setting up an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses. This will give you a cushion in case you don't find a job right away. You can then use the money you would have spent on interest to build up your emergency fund. It's all about finding a balance between paying off debt and building up your savings."

TITLE: My brother (M30) wants me (F25) to write a check from my recently deceased Grandmother

POST: update from this:

My grandma passed away today.   My brother says he needs about $15,000 to finish paying for this semester (? how that works I have no idea since it is July) and is really laying the guilt on thick -- he can't come to the funeral because he needs to stay and look for a job, he is so worried he won't be able to get a loan by the time this payment is due, etc.

This is much larger than any previous check I'd made at my grandmother's request.  I'm feeling very uncomfortable but don't know how or what to say to tell him no, I'm not going to to write a check she never told me to write.   Or how to deal with the fall out from my mom and dad, because I feel like they will be upset and not understand why I'm not OK with this.

TL;DR: My brother wants me to write a check from my recently deceased grandmother for $15,000 to pay for his semester. He's guilt-tripping me and I don't know how to say no.

**UPDATE**: I talked to my mom and she's really upset with me for not wanting to write the check. She says it's what grandma would have wanted and that I'm being selfish. I'm feeling really torn and unsure of what to do. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you handle it?

**UPDATE 2**: I tried to explain to my mom that grandma never told me to write a check for that amount and that I'm uncomfortable with it. She just kept saying that I'm being selfish and that grandma would have wanted me to help my brother. I'm feeling really frustrated and unsure of what to do. Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? How did you handle it?

**UPDATE 3**: I finally talked to my brother and told him that I'm not comfortable writing a check for that amount. He got really upset and said that I'm being selfish and that grandma would have wanted me to help him. I'm feeling really guilty and unsure of what to do. Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? How did you handle it?

**UPDATE 4**: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I don't know how to deal with my family's expectations and my own feelings of guilt and uncertainty. Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? How did you handle it?

**UPDATE 5**: I've been thinking a lot about this and I've decided that I'm going to talk to my brother again and explain to him that I'm not comfortable writing a check for that amount. I'm going to try to be more firm and assertive this time. I'm also going to talk to my mom and dad and explain my feelings and concerns. I'm hoping that they will understand and support me.

TITLE: I [23f] need to have a serious conversation with my bf [23m] of two years about marriage and our future. What topics/comments/things to avoid at all costs?

POST: Hello, I do know I am on the young side of the spectrum to be considering marriage, but my boyfriend and I have been in an LDR (different countries, four hour flight away) for the past half year, and will continue to be for at least two more years, minimum. I feel that a serious conversation about marriage and our future is necessary soon. 

Now, for context, we started this relationship knowing that we would be an eventual LDR and with the assumption that we would probably get married in our mid-late twenties. However, we're about to hit a point in our lives where there might be a big change, depending on whether I get the job I applied for or not. i want to talk to him and figure out our options together. 

So this was how I thought I'd proceed. 

1. Tell him that I want to have a serious conversation about our future in general, and marriage (children, our own families), our values (religion, abortion, homosexuality), our finances (current and potential future), and our future(what happens if only one of us gets the job, what happens if neither of us get the job, can we survive the two year separation that's left, etc). 

2. Give him a few days warning so he has time to think about it. 

3. Sit down and have the conversation at home, cuddled on the couch, and with a beer each (only one each so we don't get drunk) and quiet music. 

However, are there any topics, questions, comments, or attitude to avoid (that is not blatantly obvious)? Or, are there any additional topics,questions we must go over?

TL;DR: I'm planning to have a serious conversation with my boyfriend about marriage and our future. I want to know what topics, comments, and attitude to avoid, and if there are any additional topics we should discuss.

**Community Response:**

* "I think you're being really responsible and proactive about having this conversation. It's great that you're thinking about your future together. Just remember to listen to his thoughts and feelings as well, and try not to put too much pressure on him. It's okay if he needs time to think about it."
* "I think it's great that you're considering all the potential scenarios and wanting to have a plan in place. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not be on the same page as you, and try not to get defensive if he doesn't share your views."
* "I would suggest avoiding any accusatory language or tone, and try to approach the conversation as a collaborative discussion. You both want the same thing - to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship - so try to focus on that."
* "It might be helpful to have a list of questions prepared ahead of time, so you can make sure you cover all the topics you want to discuss. But also be open to hearing his thoughts and ideas, and don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your values and what's important to you. Just remember that your partner may have different values or beliefs, and that's okay. Try to find common ground and respect each other's differences."
* "It might be helpful to have a plan in place for how you'll handle disagreements or differences of opinion. You both want to be on the same page, but it's okay if you don't always agree. Just make sure you're both willing to listen to each other and work through any issues that come up."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your finances and what your future might look like. Just remember that you both have different financial situations and goals, and that's okay. Try to find a compromise and work together to achieve your goals."
* "It might be helpful to have a plan in place for how you'll handle the two-year separation. You both want to be together, but it's okay if you can't be right now. Just make sure you're both willing to work through the challenges and stay committed to each other."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your options and what's best for your relationship. Just remember that you both have different goals and aspirations, and that's okay. Try to find a compromise and work together to achieve your goals."

TITLE: ex took me for granted, is now 'changing', and wants me back. Help?!

POST: My boyfriend (22) and I (22) had been dating for almost 4 years. There was a short breakup in there about 11 months ago in the Spring because I was unhappy/didn't feel appreciated/could no longer put up with his lengthy list of bad habits and his attitude. After that breakup he 'changed'. He did everything the way I pictured a relationship should be. So we got back together a few weeks later.

Fast forward to the Fall: He is back to his old habits but worse. But there are still good times so I ignore them. And our relationship continues. But come Winter, we just are not happy. So we break up about a week ago.

And then it all happens again. He 'changes'. He say's most of the change is because his doctor told him he needs to shape up, and he blamed most of our problem on the fact that he'd gotten fat and self conscious about that. Now he's running, and working out, and eating well, and stopping smoking, and is being more exciting and seems happier, and listening to me, and we have actual communication, and he shows affection, and sex (yes, we're broken up, I know it's bad and confusing), and he deleted his video games, and stopped sitting on reddit for endless hours(no offense, reddit). All the things that weren't there before.

He's doing what he did last time that worked to get me back last time again, but with much greater effort and what I think is more sincerity. 

I don't want to be a fool. It is nice spending time with him, now that everything is what I wanted in a relationship. But with us, it seems like we're better a bf/gf when we are broken up. I am really at a loss as to what to do. I don't want to not spend time with him. But I don't want to jump right back into it and repeat the cycle. Did he change, and is that change enough to make us work, or is this a failing relationship which is bound to be prolonged? Please, may I have some advice? I don't know what I want.

TL;DR: Ex took me for granted, broke up, changed, and wants me back. He's doing all the things I wanted in a relationship, but I'm unsure if it's genuine or just a tactic to get me back. Help me figure out what to do!

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you gotta ask yourself: is this change sustainable? Has he genuinely changed or is he just trying to win you back? You deserve someone who will make an effort to be a better partner without needing to break up first."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to want to spend time with someone who's making an effort to change. But don't forget to take a step back and assess the situation objectively. Ask yourself if this change is just a temporary fix or if it's a long-term commitment."
* "I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's usually a sign of a deeper issue. He's not changing for himself, he's changing for you. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who will work on themselves regardless of whether you're in a relationship or not."
* "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. You don't have to make a decision right away. Use this time to reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. When you're ready, you can re-evaluate the situation and make a decision that's best for you."
* "Honestly, it sounds like he's just trying to win you back. He's not genuinely changed, he's just trying to get you back. You deserve someone who will work on themselves and make an effort to be a better partner without needing to break up first. Don't fall for it again." 
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Ask him why he's making these changes and if they're sustainable. Also, ask him what he's willing to do to maintain these changes and work on the issues in your relationship. If he's genuinely committed to change, he'll be willing to have that conversation with you." 
* "I think you're being too focused on the surface-level changes he's making. What about the underlying issues that caused the problems in your relationship in the first place? Have those been addressed? If not, then it's just a Band-Aid solution and not a real fix."

TITLE: (21f)Accidentally spilled out a drunken 'I think I love you' to my new boyfriend (21m). He handled it better than I did.

POST: My boyfriend and I just started dating a few days ago. He asked me out nye (super romantically, it was pretty adorable tbh)
We only recently met (2 months ago) but have ended up very close. I'm a very emotional person and he's very reserved and I'm cool with that. While super drunk last night in a total lapse of judgement I blurted out 'I think I love you' in kind of a half joking way (because obviously we still aren't THAT close being we've really just met) but it definitely caught him off guard and made him feel super uncomfortable. Being drunk I immediately went into 'holy shit I'm sorry wow that was stupid I'm an idiot' mode and got pretty upset, it's the first time I've gotten that way around him and It kind of spiraled into me feeling even more shitty about making him uncomfortable which in turn made him feel worse. He's an absolute sweetheart and was very honest with me, telling me he was uncomfortable with it but he's not thoroughly turned off from the fact I said it, just that he can't say it back. He hasn't had much relationship experience and I do know he does like me, but I also know that now I've compromised my calm and collected attitude and made myself look vulnerable, which leaves me with a lingering anxiety about how he's feeling and what he may not be saying. 

Everything is fine this morning, he kissed me goodbye and I went off to work and I'm going back to see him tonight, but I feel that I've thoroughly fucked everything up and can't really go back from this. Is this feeling in the pit of my stomach valid or am I just overreacting?

TL;DR: Accidentally spilled out a drunken 'I think I love you' to my new boyfriend, he handled it better than I did, now I'm worried about how he feels and if I've ruined things.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationship_advice community can provide helpful and supportive advice. The OP (original poster) is clearly upset and worried about how their boyfriend will react to their drunken confession, and the community responds with empathy and practical advice.

Some of the top comments include:

* "You're not alone in this feeling! It's normal to feel anxious after a big confession like that. Try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling and what you're worried about. It might help to clear the air and give you both a better understanding of where you stand."
* "It's okay to make mistakes and have regrets. The important thing is that you're willing to own up to it and apologize. Your boyfriend seems like a good guy, and I'm sure he'll appreciate your honesty and vulnerability."
* "Don't worry too much about what he's thinking or feeling right now. Just focus on having a good conversation with him and being open and honest about your feelings. Remember that it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. You can always take things back to where you were before if you need to."

The community also provides some practical advice, such as:

* "Try to have a calm and rational conversation with your boyfriend tonight. Avoid getting too emotional or defensive, and try to focus on the present moment rather than worrying about the future."
* "It might be helpful to have a'reset' conversation with your boyfriend, where you both agree to start fresh and forget about the drunken confession. This can help you both move forward and avoid any lingering awkwardness."
* "Remember that it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. You don't have to have all the answers right now. Just focus on enjoying each other's company and seeing where things go."

Overall, the r/relationship_advice community provides a supportive and non-judgmental space for people to share their concerns and worries, and offers helpful advice and guidance to help them navigate their relationships.

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my dating person [24 M] of ~5 months, wondering how to / if I can even ask him to delete nude vid I sent him

POST: Started dating one of my closest guy friends (known him since I was 5 years old) on in May this year. We hit it off great and generally we are happy together. He asked me for exclusivity, and I gave it. He hasn't directly asked me to be his girlfriend though, so I assume that we're just dating, exclusively.

I'm not the type to post a lot of pics of myself anywhere. It's a personal thing that I dislike doing. But he often asks for them. I usually just decline and tell him that if he wants to see me, I'll hang out with him in person/online (Skype and stuff). 

Then one day I got curious and made a < 30 second vid of me naked (just me showing off my body and playing with my tits/ass). I sent it to him and he really liked it. Mind you, I hesitated for several hours before sending that video. After a few days though, I began to realize why I never did those things in the past. I regret sending him it and ***I just want to have him delete the video for good, right away!***

I don't know how to do this. I don't even know if it's fair for me to. I just regret it so much (and needless to say, I will never do anything like this ever again).

TL;DR: Sent a nude video to my boyfriend (we're not official, but we're exclusive) and now I want him to delete it. How can I ask him to do this without feeling like I'm being too controlling/needy?

---

**REPLIES**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I think you're being really reasonable here. It's totally understandable that you're feeling regretful about sending that video. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. You could say something like 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about the video I sent you the other day, and I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable about it. Would you be able to delete it for me?' Be honest about your feelings and why you're asking him to delete it. I'm sure he'll understand where you're coming from."

2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself here. It's not uncommon for people to send explicit content to their partners, and it's not necessarily a big deal. That being said, if you're feeling uncomfortable about it, it's totally reasonable to ask him to delete it. Just make sure you're having this conversation in a non-accusatory way and try not to make him feel guilty about it. Remember, communication is key in any relationship!"

3. **u/anonymous123456**: "OP, I'm a guy and I've been in similar situations before. I think you're being really brave for acknowledging your feelings and wanting to take control of the situation. When I was in a similar situation, I just told my partner that I was feeling uncomfortable and asked them to delete the content. They understood where I was coming from and we moved on. Just be honest and open with your partner, and I'm sure everything will be fine."

4. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on the video itself. Instead of just asking him to delete it, why not have a conversation about boundaries and what makes you feel comfortable in your relationship? It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to take control of the situation. Just remember that relationships are about communication and mutual respect. Try to focus on building a stronger connection with your partner rather than just asking them to delete a video."

TITLE: I [34M] am going to visit my friend [32F] in another state in a few weeks. There could be relationship potential, but when should I say something?

POST: So I'm going to visit a friend of mine in another state in a little over a month. We've been friends for over ten years and we've always gotten along really well. She's smart and she's attractive, we know how to make each other laugh and we have a lot in common. I think that there could be more than just a friendship here, there could be relationship potential.

A little background: This girl and I have known each other since college. She used to date one of my best friends, but we've known each other since before that relationship and have kept in touch since then. We drifted apart for a couple of years after they broke up but have gotten back in touch and have grown closer as friends over the last couple of years. I would have said something to her sooner, but I was in another relationship anyway until about two years ago and until know I've been reluctant to pursue someone my friend had dated.

The question is, when is the best time to bring this up? The tickets are purchased and I'll make the trip regardless. I have no doubt that it will be a fun visit either way. Should I say something before I get on the plane to go visit? Should I wait until I get there and can ask her in person? (Should I make a drunken pass and see how she reacts? :-P ) Help me figure out what to do!

TL;DR: I'm going to visit a friend in another state and I think there could be relationship potential. Should I say something before I go or wait until I get there?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you should wait until you get there and have a chance to talk to her in person. You can get a better sense of her feelings and vibe when you're face to face. Plus, it's a more intimate setting and you can have a more meaningful conversation. Just be genuine and respectful, and see how she reacts. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the above comment. It's better to have the conversation in person. But before you do, take some time to reflect on your feelings and what you're looking for in a relationship. Make sure you're not just looking for a hookup or a rebound. Be clear about your intentions and boundaries, and see if she's on the same page. Good luck!"
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should be careful about making a move on someone you've known for so long. You've had a history with her ex, and that can be complicated. Make sure you're not just looking to rekindle something that's already been tried and failed. Take some time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to put in to make it work. And don't be afraid to walk away if it's not meant to be."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "Aww, I think this is so sweet! I think you should definitely say something before you get on the plane. You never know how things might go, and it's better to be upfront and honest. Just be respectful and considerate of her feelings, and see how she reacts. Good luck, and I hope it works out for you both!"

TITLE: I [21m] recently found out my semi-LDR girlfriend [19F] of a year has depression. She has started acting cold and uncaring when we are apart.

POST: Not really sure what advice im looking for.... am I overreacting? should i be worried she is fed up?  

Girlfriend is in college during the week and we only see each other on weekends when she is back home. About 3/4 weeks ago she was not answering my texts or just being very aloof with me. When we met up at the weekend she eventually admitted that she has had depression before and is going through it again so she wanted to break up because in the past she has treated her boyfriends like shit during these periods and didn't want to do that to me. I said no, thanked her for telling me what was happening and then said we would get through this rough patch.  

So since then she has gone from texting me and talking throughout the day to maybe getting a text or two in reply to something I sent during the day. I know this sounds stupid but we have ended almost all of our texts for the past year with an "x" but she is even rarely doing that now. She is even purposefully ignoring texts as I get the read notification and if i get a reply it can be hours later.  

One part I can't understand is, when we are together at weekends things seem almost normal as she seems happy to see me, we hang out, sleep together etc.  
We even talk about possibly moving out together in the summer.  

I know she told me she would be rough to deal with during this time but whenever I have asked whats up she says everything is fine. But I know during the times she is ignoring me she is actively talking to people on facebook/text etc.  

Apologies about the wall of text but this whole new behavior is driving me insane! And I don't know if Im worrying over nothing

TL;DR: Girlfriend of a year has depression, has been acting cold and uncaring when we're apart, but seems fine when we're together. She's stopped texting me and is ignoring my messages, but says everything is fine. Should I be worried?

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're being really understanding and supportive, and it's great that you're willing to work through this with her. However, it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you're feeling anxious or worried about her behavior, it's okay to express those feelings to her and ask for reassurance. It's also important to remember that you can't fix her depression, but you can support her in getting help."
* "It sounds like she's struggling to cope with her depression and is using avoidance as a coping mechanism. It's not uncommon for people with depression to push others away or become distant. It's great that you're willing to work through this with her, but you also need to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how her behavior is affecting you and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I think you're being really understanding and supportive, but you also need to consider the possibility that she may not be ready to work through this with you right now. Depression can be a really tough and overwhelming experience, and it's okay if she needs some space. You can still be supportive and caring without being overly attached or clingy. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about what she needs from you right now, and see if you can find a way to support her that works for both of you."
* "I think you're being really understanding and supportive, but you also need to consider the possibility that she may be using her depression as an excuse to avoid dealing with the issues in your relationship. It's not uncommon for people to use their mental health as a way to avoid conflict or difficult conversations. Have an open and honest conversation with her about what's going on and see if you can find a way to work through this together." 

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP is being understanding and supportive, but needs to prioritize his own emotional well-being.
* The girlfriend's behavior may be a coping mechanism for her depression, and the OP needs to have an open and honest conversation with her about how her behavior is affecting him.
* The OP needs to consider the possibility that the girlfriend may not be ready to work through this with him right now, and needs to prioritize his own needs and boundaries.
* The OP needs to be aware of the possibility that the girlfriend may be using her depression as an excuse to avoid dealing with issues in the relationship. 

**Red flags:**

* The girlfriend's sudden change in behavior, such as ignoring the OP's texts and being cold and uncaring when they're apart.
* The girlfriend's lack of transparency about what's going on and her refusal to have open and honest conversations about her feelings and needs.
* The girlfriend's use of her depression as an excuse to avoid dealing with issues in the relationship. 

**Green flags:**

* The girlfriend's willingness to open up about her depression and her desire to work through it with the OP.
* The OP's willingness to be understanding and supportive, and his desire to work through this with the girlfriend.
* The girlfriend's occasional displays of happiness and affection when they're together. 

Overall, the situation is complex and requires careful consideration and communication from both parties. The OP needs to prioritize his own emotional well-being and have open and honest conversations with the girlfriend about how her behavior is affecting him. The girlfriend needs to be transparent about what's going on and work with the OP to find a way to support each other through this difficult time. 

**Recommendations:**

* The OP should have an open and honest conversation with the girlfriend about how her behavior is affecting him and express his feelings and concerns.
* The girlfriend should be encouraged to seek professional help for her depression and work with the OP to find a way to support each other through this difficult time.
* The couple should prioritize communication and transparency in their relationship, and work to find a way to support each other through the ups and downs of life. 

**Additional resources:**

* The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides information and resources for individuals and families affected by mental illness.
* The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) provides information and resources for individuals and families affected by suicide.
* The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides information and resources for individuals and families affected by mental health issues. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. 

Best,

TITLE: Reddit, Forrest needs your help identifying a genetic disease.  Calling those with superb internet skills and a passion for cute things. Pics inside.

POST: Four weeks ago, a mouse I adopted had six babies.  All the babies looked like [wrinkly pink jelly beans]  Nothing was amiss.  

Day 6 or so, we thought it was safe to [begin handling the babies]  All babies looked fit and healthy and [were all the same size]  It appeared as though they were having trouble moving their hind legs, but I chocked that up to them just learning to walk.  I noticed it especially in the dark grey-brown ones, but in hindsight, maybe I had been handling the same mouse every time thinking that they were different.  The only female was the white one, the rest were males, which made it even harder to differentiate between the three ones of the same color.

Once they really started growing hair and we handled them for hours at a time, we noticed [this guy]  Do you see anything odd about him?  How about if we [compare him to his brother]  At first we thought he was paralyzed, but it soon became clear that was not the case.  He could move his tail and his hind legs freely, but he didn't do it often.  When he did decide to move his legs, the movements were stiff.  He could curl his toes.  He used his whole leg like a flipper to push himself along the table.  We named him Forrest, after Forrest Gump, because he is a determined bugger who can't walk or do any mouse things as well as his brothers.  

Now, he is one third the size of his family.  He developed slower than the others after day 12; his eyes opened about 4 days later, he took the longest to wean, and he is the least adventurous (understandably). 

As with most random mouse pregnancies, there is a chance of the litter being a result of inbreeding.  His body size makes me think it's not an environmental or physical cause, which leads me to genetic disease.  Do his symptoms sound like anything you know about?  My google-fu has failed me, but I am only a trainee.  Thus, Forrest and I turn to you for help.

TL;DR: Mouse has genetic disease, needs help identifying symptoms.

PICS: [Multiple pictures of the mouse babies, including Forrest]

Reddit, can you help Forrest? Share your knowledge and expertise to help this little guy!  What do you think is causing his symptoms?  Is it a known genetic disease?  How can we help him?

TITLE: I feel like I'm going to be trapped in retail. Am I a failure?

POST: I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.

I'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.

I just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to). I just feel like a failure who doesn't know what to do.

TL;DR: I'm 25, still living with my parents, working in retail, and feeling like I'm stuck. I've tried to pursue teaching, but it didn't work out. I'm feeling like I'm only qualified for retail and I don't know what to do.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck. First of all, let me tell you that you're not a failure. You're just taking a different path than you initially planned, and that's okay. It's normal to change your mind and adjust your goals as you go along.

I think it's great that you're trying to save money and pay off your debt. That's a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself for taking control of your finances. As for your job at Sears, it might not be your dream job, but it's a job that you can do, and that's something to be grateful for.

I would suggest looking into other jobs in retail that might be a better fit for you. Maybe you could look into management or a different department at Sears, or you could explore other retail jobs in your area. You might also consider looking into jobs in other industries that you're interested in, even if they're not directly related to your degree. Sometimes, it takes a little creativity and experimentation to find the right fit.

Remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just keep moving forward, and things will work out. You got this!

COMMENT 2:
OP, I totally feel you. I've been in similar shoes before, and it's tough to feel like you're stuck in a rut. But here's the thing: you're not alone. There are so many people out there who are in the same boat as you, and we're all just trying to figure things out.

I think it's great that you're looking into teaching English abroad. That's a great opportunity, and even if it doesn't work out, it's a great experience to have. And hey, you never know what might come up in the future. You might find a job that you love, or you might find a new passion that you never knew you had.

As for your job at Sears, I think it's great that you're taking it seriously and trying to make the best of it. Sometimes, it's not about finding the perfect job, but about finding a job that you can do and that allows you to pay the bills. And hey, who knows, you might find that you actually enjoy working at Sears. You never know until you try!

Just remember that it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just keep moving forward, and things will work out. You got this!

COMMENT 3:
OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling stuck. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated. But here's the thing: you're not alone. There are so many people out there who are in the same boat as you, and we're all just trying to figure things out.

I think it's great that you're looking into other job opportunities. That's a great way to keep yourself busy and motivated. And hey, you never know what might come up in the future. You might find a job that you love, or you might find a new passion that you never knew you had.

TITLE: I [19M] am having trouble dealing with my girlfriends [19F] helicopter parents and could really use some advice.

POST: So we are both college freshman and have a fantastic relationship (almost half a year in). But the only problem I have found in our relationship is her parents. College to me seems like when we become more independent and on our own. For me that is for sure the case and I love it. But **her parents are literally in everything she does**. She calls them and tells them about every class and assignment and then they usually and way to mean and tell her to study harder and do better. She sends them assignments to look over before submission. They shove religion down her throat when she doesn't want to be part of it. For Valentines day they send a few candies and the job listings section from a paper...

**They treat her like a child and make me feel like I am dating a child.**

^ That is pretty much the main problem. I feel like I am becoming an adult and moving to the next stage and then there is her parents pretty much babying her through everything. **I know for a fact if we want to move into together in a couple years it will be a matter of asking for their permission rather than "We decided to move in" which is insane to me.** An important factor I think is that they are rather well off and pay for all her things, including all college expenses. She has never had a job. I am from a poor family and worked my way here which makes me feel like we are different somehow. Any advice could help me so much, thank you.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's helicopter parents are super involved in her life and make me feel like I'm dating a child. They treat her like a kid and I'm worried about our future together.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

1. **Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend**: Share your concerns with her and explain how her parents' behavior is making you feel. Be specific about the instances that have bothered you and listen to her perspective as well.
2. **Encourage your girlfriend to set boundaries**: Suggest that she talk to her parents about setting some boundaries and giving her more independence. It's possible that they're not aware of how their behavior is affecting her.
3. **Focus on your own goals and aspirations**: Since you're from a poor family and worked your way through college, you have a strong sense of self-reliance. Focus on your own goals and aspirations, and don't let your girlfriend's parents' behavior dictate your feelings about your relationship.
4. **Consider having a conversation with her parents**: If you feel comfortable doing so, consider having a conversation with her parents about your concerns. Approach the conversation calmly and respectfully, and try to focus on the impact their behavior is having on your relationship rather than attacking them personally.
5. **Evaluate whether this is a deal-breaker for you**: If you feel like her parents' behavior is a major issue for you and you're not comfortable with the level of involvement they have in your girlfriend's life, it may be worth considering whether this is a relationship you want to continue.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* Communication is key: Have open and honest conversations with your girlfriend and her parents to address your concerns.
* Set boundaries: Encourage your girlfriend to set boundaries with her parents and give her more independence.
* Focus on your own goals: Don't let your girlfriend's parents' behavior dictate your feelings about your relationship.
* Evaluate the relationship: Consider whether the level of involvement her parents have in her life is a deal-breaker for you.

POST: So, we met on the ever popular OKCupid about a month ago, and have been on around 8 dates since. On our second date we ended up going home together, and having sex, but there was no awkwardness afterwards and arranged another date over coffee in the morning. 

On Thursday last week, we had a bit of a "where is this going?" conversation, in which he confessed he's never really had a relationship or dated extensively. I have dated and had relationships in the past, so understand that it's a bit of an awkward new world for some people. I'm really into him, but he doesn't seem available outside of face to face dating. When we're together we have a great time, lots of fun and good conversations, but when we're apart he ignores my texts, doesn't speak to me often and seems bored when I attempt to strike up a conversation. It's leaving me a little confused and frustrated.

TL;DR: I'm dating an inexperienced dater who doesn't know how to navigate relationships, and I'm not sure what's going on or how to make it work.

QUESTIONS:

1. How can I help him learn to navigate relationships and communicate better?
2. Should I be patient and give him time to figure things out, or is it time to reevaluate the relationship?
3. Are there any red flags I should be looking out for in this situation?

ANSWERS:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not your job to teach him how to navigate relationships. You can't force someone to grow or learn, and it's not fair to expect you to do so. If he's not willing to put in the effort to communicate and be present in the relationship, it might be time to reevaluate."

2. **u/relationshipguru**: "Patience can be a virtue, but it's also important to recognize when someone is not willing to put in the effort. If he's consistently ignoring your texts and seems bored when you try to talk, it might be a sign that he's not invested in the relationship. It's okay to take a step back and assess whether this is a relationship you want to continue."

3. **u/RedFlagRanger**: "Red flags to watch out for: 1) He's consistently ignoring your texts and doesn't make an effort to initiate conversations. 2) He's not willing to have open and honest conversations about his feelings and intentions. 3) He's not making an effort to spend quality time with you outside of dates. If you notice any of these red flags, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."

**u/throwaway123456**: "Also, don't forget to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you're feeling frustrated and confused, it's okay to take a step back and focus on yourself. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel seen, heard, and valued."

TITLE: I [27 F] can't get over the fact that my SO [28 M] of three years had a pet name for his ex but not for me

POST: I know this is probably an irrational worry/concern because aside from this "little" thing, we have a great relationship. 

Somewhat early on in the relationship I found out from old facebook posts/albums that my SO had a pet name for his ex with whom he had an LDR for about half of the time they spent as a couple (about two years). He used to call her his "kitty". I love nicknames and terms of endearment like this. It makes me feel special and close to another person when they call me something other than my given name. My SO and I have been together for three years but he's never even tried calling me anything other than my name. I've already told him how I feel about pet names but still, nothing. I've even tried calling him silly or cute names but nothing has ever really stuck. I'm at the point where I don't really want to force it because I feel like stuff like that should come naturally. Which makes the whole ex-pet-name thing something that's bothered me for the longest time. He doesn't know that I know (because at this point I feel like it would be creepy to bring it up). Also, the name "kitty" really gets me because he loves cats. (not surprising, I know) So much so that every time that he sees one he'll say "kitty" in almost a baby-talk cutesy voice. 

So I guess I'm feeling like I'm not as special/close/precious to him as his ex was just because he doesn't have a pet name for me. I don't know if it's even worth talking about with him because as I said, everything else is great and it's not that I don't feel loved... my scumbag brain just won't leave me alone about it :(

TL;DR: SO had a pet name for his ex ("kitty") but never for me. I love pet names and feel like it's a sign of closeness. I've told him how I feel but nothing has ever stuck. I'm worried that it means I'm not as special to him as his ex was. 

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: the fear of not being special or loved enough. The OP (original poster) is worried that her SO's lack of a pet name for her means that he doesn't consider her as special or close to him as his ex was. This fear is fueled by the fact that her SO had a pet name for his ex, which makes her feel like she's not as important or valued in the relationship.

The OP's concern is understandable, as pet names can be a way to show affection and closeness in a relationship. However, it's important to remember that every person is different, and what may be important to one person may not be as important to another. It's possible that her SO simply hasn't thought to give her a pet name, or that he's not as into pet names as she is.

The OP's decision to not bring it up with her SO is also understandable, as it's possible that it could lead to an uncomfortable conversation. However, it's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and needs. If the OP is feeling like she's not as special or loved as she could be, it may be worth having a conversation with her SO about how she feels and what she needs from the relationship.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. It's okay to have different preferences and needs, and it's important to be open and honest with your partner about what you want and need from the relationship. With open communication and a willingness to listen and understand each other, couples can work through issues like this and come out stronger on the other side.

TITLE: Question about work. I may be in trouble.

POST: Here is what happened... 

I have been working at a company for 3 weeks. I was assigned a project by my boss's boss's boss who never gave me a due date. While I was working on the project, my boss's boss told me that I should have someone look it over before turning it in.

The next week I sent an email to my boss's boss's boss (the big man) giving him a short answer in case he needed it right away. Later that day I had finished editing my project. At the end of the day, the big man told me "I look forward to reading your project," while he was walking out the door. I panicked and sent him my project. 

The next day my boss asked me if I had sent the big man my project and I said yes. She told me that her boss (my boss's boss) told her that all my work had to go through her. 

I want to ask reddit

A. Does anyone think I will get fired for this?
B. What would you have done differently to avoid this situation?

TL;DR: New employee sent project to big boss without going through boss, now worried about getting fired.

---

**Reddit's Response:**

**A. Does anyone think I will get fired for this?**

* "Honestly, it's not the end of the world, but it's definitely a rookie mistake. I think you'll get a talking-to, but probably not fired. Just be prepared to explain yourself and apologize for the oversight." - u/throwaway1234567
* "Fired? No, but you might get a stern warning and a reminder to follow proper channels. Just be grateful you didn't send it to the wrong person or something." - u/throwaway7890
* "It depends on the company culture and the big boss's personality. If they're a laid-back person, they might just laugh it off. But if they're a by-the-book kind of person, you might be in trouble." - u/throwaway3456

**B. What would you have done differently to avoid this situation?**

* "I would have asked your boss or someone in HR about the proper protocol for submitting projects. It's always better to err on the side of caution." - u/throwaway1234567
* "I would have asked for a due date or a confirmation of who to send it to. And I would have double-checked with my boss before sending it to the big boss." - u/throwaway7890
* "I would have taken a few minutes to think about it before sending it off. Panic is not a good decision-making tool." - u/throwaway3456

---

**Reddit's Advice:**

* Be prepared to explain yourself and apologize for the mistake.
* Follow proper channels and protocols for submitting projects.
* Ask questions and clarify expectations before taking action.
* Take a few minutes to think before making a decision.
* Be grateful that it's not the end of the world and that you can learn from the experience.

---

**Reddit's Humor:**

* "Well, at least you didn't send it to the CEO's email address... yet." - u/throwaway1234567
* "I'm pretty sure the big boss was just trying to see how quickly you'd send it to him. You passed the test!" - u/throwaway7890
* "I hope you didn't send it to the big boss's spam folder. That would be a real tragedy." - u/throwaway3456

---

**Reddit's Support:**

* "Don't worry, it's an easy mistake to make. Just own up to it and move forward." - u/throwaway1234567
* "You'll be fine. Just be more careful in the future and you'll be golden." - u/throwaway7890
* "It's okay to make mistakes. It's how you learn and grow. Just take it as a lesson and move on." - u/throwaway3456

---

**Reddit's TL;DR:**

* Don't send projects to the big boss without going through the proper channels.
* Ask questions and clarify expectations before taking action.
* Be prepared to explain yourself and apologize for the mistake.
* Take a few minutes to think before making a decision.
* And remember, it's not the end of the world. You can learn from the experience and move forward.

TITLE: How can I keep my parents' cigarette smoke off of me on my way to a college scholarship day, where I will be interviewed?

POST: This Saturday (Feb. 8) my parents and I will be driving to the college that I will be attending this fall, which is about an hour and a half drive from home, give or take. My parents have been smokers for my whole life, so I am pretty desensitized to the smell, but many instructors and just random bystanders have commented about the scent on my person. This will not make a good impression on the committee (at least I think it is a committee. either way, it will be noticeable). I tried to ask very nicely if at least my mom would consider not smoking, but she kind of laughed at me and made a bunch of rude, sarcastic comments about how it's not really that noticeable, and my character should be enough to win over the interviewers. 1. My personality is not the best, and I'm not too great at interviews and 2. If the competition is tough, I am pretty sure that it WILL go down to the first impression that is given, and the smell of cigarettes is NOT going to give a good impression, even if I apologized and that my parents were smokers.

Some suggestions that I have been given by instructors/counselors include: chewing cinnamon gum, packing my clothes and covering my hair until I get there (which I'm not too keen on, because I don't know where I would really change or anything like that), and putting cooking vanilla in the car? I'm not too sure about that one. Will any of these work? Other suggestions are very welcome.

TL;DR: I'm going to a college scholarship interview and I'm worried about the smell of my parents' cigarette smoke on me. I've tried asking them to not smoke, but they won't listen. What can I do to minimize the smell?

1. "I'm a non-smoker, but I've had to deal with the smell of smoke on my clothes and hair before. I've found that a strong perfume or cologne can help mask the smell. Just make sure it's not overpowering, you don't want to be the one who smells like a perfume factory. You could also try using a fabric refresher spray or dryer sheets to help eliminate the smell from your clothes."
2. "I'm a smoker, but I understand your concern. One thing that might help is to open a window in the car during the drive. Fresh air can help dissipate the smell. You could also try using an air purifier or a dehumidifier in the car to help remove the smell from the air."
3. "I'm not sure if this will work, but you could try using a scented candle or essential oil diffuser in the car. The smell of the candle or oil might help mask the smell of the smoke. Just be sure to choose a scent that you like and that won't overpower the room."

TITLE: How can I tell if She [22/F] is uninterested or just shy after first date with Me [22/M].

POST: I've just come out of a 4 year relationships a month later set up a date with a girl I've had previous dates with. Our previous dates were always a bit awkward because we were both nervous and I've always found it hard to talk to the opposite sex (so lots of silence).

So I began talking to her again last week and I decided not to beat around the bush and asked if she wanted to catch up for coffee to which she agreed. So the beginning of the date kind of started awkward i found her eyes kept moving around the room and wouldn't keep eye contact for long, there were moments of short awkward pauses like before, she asked me questions about my family and about other things but I felt I was asking her more questions. The second half i felt we became more comfortable she kept moving her hair behind her ear, would smile more and kept eye contact more and we ended up talking straight for just over an hour. But after the date was over I feel disconnected or not reaching the level of intimacy that I feel i should've.

I'm not sure if because of my low self esteem/ confidence of a bad breakup I'm overthinking or over expecting things or seeing shyness as being bored or uninterested, Or if shes sending me hints she wants to just be friends.

Also is it appropriate to send the night of the date a "I had a great time, we should catch up again soon" message?

TL;DR: Had a first date with a girl I've had previous dates with, felt like it was going well but now I'm unsure if she's just shy or uninterested. Should I send a message after the date?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're reading way too much into it. She seemed shy at first, but then opened up and seemed to enjoy herself. Don't overthink it. Just relax and see where things go. And yeah, send that message, it's a normal thing to do after a date."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're giving her too much credit for being'shy'. It sounds like she was just nervous, which is normal on a first date. If you're feeling disconnected, maybe try to initiate more conversations and see if she opens up more. And yes, send that message, it's a great way to keep the momentum going."
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I'm a girl and I can tell you that sometimes we just need a little time to warm up. It sounds like she was a bit nervous at first, but then relaxed and had a good time. Don't overthink it, just be yourself and see where things go. And yeah, send that message, it's a normal thing to do."
4. **u/overthinker**: "I'm with you on this one, OP. I think you're right to be unsure. If she was really interested, wouldn't she be the one initiating conversations and asking more questions? Maybe try to get a better read on her by asking her about her interests and hobbies. And yeah, send that message, but don't get your hopes up too high."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and enjoy the process. If she's interested, she'll let you know. If not, then at least you tried. And yeah, send that message, it's a great way to keep the connection going. But don't get too attached just yet, let things develop naturally."

TITLE: Misuse of plates/unregistered vehicle in Massachusetts.

POST: Recently I was pulled over while driving an unregistered vehicle with another vehicle's plates on it in MA while driving from NY to CT.  

My mom had bought the car a couple days prior and was having issues getting temporary registration so the plates from another one of our cars was put on it temporarily so it could be driven to CT and gotten registered.  I went so that both the car driven up there and the "new" (used) car could be driven back.

When I was pulled over I was issued a written warning for passing at an unsafe speed (definitely my fault as I made the large mistake of slowing down while passing another car because I saw a police officer) and for "unregistered MV".  The officer took the plates and the car had to get towed.

I have the number of the tow company so I/my mom can return and get the car after paying for the tow (I don't believe the car was impounded but if it was then I suppose we have to take care of that too) and getting temporary plates in CT.

What I haven't been able to figure out by asking Google is how to get our old plates back and what repercussions we'll be facing.  We've been trying to get through via phone to the police station in the town I was pulled over in but we've had no luck so far.  If anyone has any suggestions/answers on how to get the old plates back/get us able to drive our old car again and what we'll have to do (what fees or other legal problems can we expect) I'd be way appreciative.

TL;DR: Pulled over in MA for unregistered vehicle with another vehicle's plates on it. Got a written warning and the car was towed. Need help figuring out how to get our old plates back and what repercussions we'll face.

I'm not a lawyer, but I'll try to provide some general information and guidance. Please consult with a licensed attorney for specific advice.

**Unregistered Vehicle:**

In Massachusetts, it is illegal to operate a vehicle without a valid registration. (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 90, Section 10)

**Consequences:**

You may face the following consequences:

2. **License Suspension:** Your driver's license may be suspended or revoked if you are found to have operated an unregistered vehicle.
3. **Criminal Charges:** You may be charged with a crime, such as larceny or fraud, for using another vehicle's plates without permission.
4. **Towing and Storage Fees:** You will need to pay towing and storage fees to retrieve your vehicle.

**How to Get Your Old Plates Back:**

To get your old plates back, you will need to:

1. **Contact the Police Department:** Reach out to the police department where you were pulled over and ask about the process for retrieving your plates.
2. **Provide Documentation:** Be prepared to provide documentation, such as proof of ownership and proof of registration, to prove that the plates were used temporarily and not stolen.
3. **Pay Any Fines or Fees:** You may need to pay any fines or fees associated with the misuse of plates and the unregistered vehicle.

**Getting Your Vehicle Back:**

To get your vehicle back, you will need to:

1. **Pay Towing and Storage Fees:** You will need to pay the towing and storage fees to retrieve your vehicle.
2. **Get Temporary Plates:** You will need to obtain temporary plates to operate your vehicle legally.
3. **Register Your Vehicle:** You will need to register your vehicle with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) to obtain a valid registration.

**Next Steps:**

I recommend that you:

1. **Contact the Police Department:** Reach out to the police department where you were pulled over and ask about the process for retrieving your plates and getting your vehicle back.
2. **Consult with a Lawyer:** Consider consulting with a licensed attorney who is familiar with Massachusetts traffic laws to get specific advice on your situation.

POST: Title pretty much explains it, I've been dating a girl for the last four months and have really enjoyed spending time with her.  We have alot of common interests, the sex is great and I'm happy around her.

But the other day I came to the realization that she looks ALOT like my mom.  They both have short curly hair and similar figures.  My moms skin is alot lighter, and she is a bit shorter...  Buuuut, I can't get it out of my head now.

My family wants to meet her and I'm afraid to introduce her to them...  Could really use some insight or advice.

TL;DR: Been dating girl for 5 months, just realized she looks a lot like my mom, worried about introducing her to my family.

---

This post is a great example of a common phenomenon in relationships: the discovery of a resemblance between one's partner and a family member, often a parent. This can be a jarring and unsettling experience, especially if the resemblance is strong.

The OP (original poster) is struggling with how to process this realization and how to introduce his girlfriend to his family. He's worried about their reaction and how it might affect his relationship with his girlfriend.

The comments on this post are varied, with some people offering words of encouragement and advice, while others are more skeptical or even critical. Some common themes that emerge include:

* The importance of communication: Many commenters suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns.
* The need to focus on the present: Some people advise the OP to focus on the present moment and the relationship he has with his girlfriend, rather than getting caught up in the resemblance.
* The potential for negative reactions: A few commenters warn the OP that his family may react negatively to the resemblance, and that he should be prepared for that possibility.

Overall, this post highlights the complexities and challenges that can arise in relationships, and the importance of communication, empathy, and understanding in navigating these challenges.

TITLE: [23M] I fucked up hard

POST: Met up with 22F I've known for 8 years and liked for most of that duration (feeling has been mutual in the past, not sure about now). Noticed a bodily feature that is not normal (I brought it up because I thought it was fucking cool, I think she is the most beautiful girl in the world FFS) and mentioned it. She is super shy and stuff but even then she reacted really coldly to my remark, but I changed the subject. That was on Friday, and now I get up at 3AM to find a facebook msg from her older sister (like 26 or 27) where she is literally fucking yelling at me for hurting her lil sister by pointing that out and how she deserves better than this. I know for a fact that if this is what is coming from her older sister (who doesn't show much emotion either), the girl I like is REALLY upset.

This is coming to me after I've spent last few days thinking about this girl and being lovesick to the point where I couldn't properly do anything besides lie in my bed punching pillows and reading love novels and shit. I don't know what to do at this point. I know I should apologize but, how far should I take this? Do I just apologize? Do I tell her she is pretty? Do I tell her how much my heart hurts every night thinking about her? Do I tell her she does deserve better than me? I'm clueless. Help me out.

TL;DR: I told a girl I've known for 8 years and liked for most of that duration that I think she's beautiful, but I noticed a bodily feature that's not normal and mentioned it. Her older sister got mad at me on Facebook, saying I hurt her sister's feelings and she deserves better than me. I'm unsure of how to apologize and what to say to make things right.

---

**Top comments:**

* "Dude, you're a 23-year-old man, not a 13-year-old boy. Stop being so awkward and just apologize sincerely. You don't need to explain or justify your comment, just own up to it and move forward."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just apologize and mean it. Don't try to justify or explain your comment, just acknowledge that you hurt her feelings and promise to be more considerate in the future."
* "You're not a bad person for noticing and commenting on someone's physical feature. But you are a bad person for not considering how your comment might affect her. Apologize and make sure she knows you respect her boundaries."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not like you made a cruel or mean-spirited comment. You just made a comment that was probably unexpected and caught her off guard. Apologize and move on."
* "You're not going to fix this by overthinking it or trying to justify your comment. Just apologize and be genuine. If she's still upset after that, then maybe you should reevaluate whether you're a good match for her."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit is generally supportive and encouraging, with many users offering advice and words of comfort. However, some users are more critical and tell the OP to stop overthinking and just apologize sincerely. The overall sentiment is that the OP should take responsibility for his actions, apologize, and move forward.

TITLE: I [19m] moved to London back in May, and facing a terrible situation

POST: I moved over here for work, into a house with 4 people already living there - The ad for the room said: Professionals only.

Another guy [36m] from Romania lives in the house, and wanted his wife and 3 kids to get into the house.

Our landlord [50m] Egyptian, accepted it as a way of 'helping his family over here', which we all said was OK.

Now it turns out, they plan on staying in the house until ATLEAST next summer - and we all pay the same rent and share bills (approx 1300$ a month)

To make it even worse, his 3 kids [1/3/4] are ALWAYS awake until midnight, sometimes later, and they are so noisy it wakes me up all the time throughout my sleep, and causes too big of an exhaustion to go to work.

Our landlord put the father on the council papers and contract, and since we're too many living in the house, I'm not able to get on the contract.

What would the best solution be to actually get his kids to shut it this late?

So far I've recorded the last 3 nights - 10 minutes in the hallway, 15 minutes in my room, with constant noise from the kid - Is there anything else I can do to make our Landlord realise that it's just not okay.

I don't have the money for the deposit to get another room somewhere elsez

TL;DR: I moved to London, into a shared house with 4 people, and the landlord allowed his Romanian friend's family to move in, despite the original ad saying 'professionals only'. The kids are noisy and wake me up late at night, and I'm unable to get on the contract. What can I do to get the kids to stop making noise and get the landlord to understand the situation?

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can help individuals navigate complex and frustrating situations. The OP (original poster) is feeling overwhelmed and exhausted due to the constant noise from the kids and the lack of control they have over the situation.

The post is well-written and provides a clear overview of the situation, including the original ad, the landlord's decision, and the OP's concerns. The OP also provides evidence of the noise levels by recording the last three nights, which shows that they are taking a proactive approach to addressing the issue.

The comments on this post are also very helpful, with many users offering advice and support. Some suggestions include:

* Talking to the landlord again and explaining the situation in more detail
* Trying to negotiate a reduction in rent or a separate contract for the OP
* Considering mediation or arbitration to resolve the issue
* Looking into local noise regulations and reporting the noise to the authorities
* Seeking support from a local community or tenant organization

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a safe and supportive space for individuals to share their concerns and receive helpful advice and support.

POST: How do you break up with someone if they are the only person you've been close to in the past 4 years, if they have a shit family or no place to really call home? I am afraid I will ruin him. I can't think of life without him yet I feel we are toxic to each other.

My parents do not approve of him, say he brings nothing to the table for me and that I am not responsible for his life. It has put so much strain on our relationship throughout the years and I have found myself exhausted. Their strict rules have also been extremely troublesome/stressful for us and I am often pushed to my limits in order to maintain a balanced relationship between family and bf but more often than not one of them suffers.

I do not know if I'm trying to make things work between us because I feel guilty and responsible for him, or if I'm just afraid of what will happen if I let him go, or if we are actually meant to stay together and work through these hard times. Things have escalated in the past few weeks and this fate has become more imminent than ever. His unstable living situation is putting so much stress on the both of us. We have dealt with distance for the past 3 years horribly. I play a division 1 sport in college and have a ridiculous schedule while he has not been able to hold down a job for more than two months because of unfortunate variables relating to his shitty living situation. It will be a huge pivoting point in both of our lives if things end but I feel as if we are stuck in some awful loop of shitty circumstance and I do not know how to get out of it.

I'm sorry if this sounds pathetic this is the first time I've tried writing this. I really have no one to talk to and am in desperate need of advice. 

I am at my wits end. He is so important to me and I just want to do what will be best for both of us in the end.

TL;DR: 21F, 4 year relationship with 21M, toxic and stressful due to his unstable living situation, family disapproval, and my own exhaustion. I'm torn between guilt, fear, and uncertainty. How do I break up with him and what are my options for moving forward?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot. I think it's important to acknowledge that you can't fix his living situation or his family issues, and that's not your responsibility. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship, and if that's not happening, it might be time to reevaluate. Have you considered couples therapy to work through some of these issues? It might help you both communicate better and find some common ground."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's hard to break up with someone you care about, especially when you've been together for a long time. But sometimes, it's necessary for your own well-being. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel supported, happy, and fulfilled. If that's not happening with your boyfriend, it might be time to consider moving on. Remember that you're not responsible for his life or his living situation. You can't fix everything for him, and it's not your job to do so."
3. **u/itsmeagain**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure of what to do. I think it's important to remember that you can't control other people's actions or circumstances, but you can control how you react to them. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship, and if that's not happening, it might be time to reevaluate. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and concerns? They might be able to help you work through some of these issues and find a way forward that's best for you."

5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I just wanted to add that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires in this situation. You don't have to stay in a relationship that's not working for you just because you feel guilty or responsible for your boyfriend. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and if that means ending the relationship, then so be it. Remember that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time."

TITLE: [22] and pregnant, what would you do?

POST: I'm a moderately high achieving community college student and president of a club.

I'm currently eligible for three AA degrees, my plan is to get my Bachelor's in zoology, then go to vet school.

/endbrag

All signs point to not having this baby right?

My boyfriend of four years is super supportive and really wants to have this baby. He said he would do everything he can so I don't have to stop going to school. However he said he would support me with whatever decision I make.

Currently I live with my parents, I expect to get kicked out which wouldn't be terrible I guess because my boyfriend and his family are moving up north closer to the school I want to transfer to.

TL;DR: I'm 22, pregnant, and unsure what to do. I'm a student, I want to finish my degree, and I'm worried about being kicked out of my parents' house.

ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:

* "You're 22, you're pregnant, and you're in a good place. You've got a supportive boyfriend and a plan for your future. You can do this. Don't let fear and uncertainty hold you back."
* "It's great that your boyfriend is supportive, but don't forget to prioritize your own needs and desires. What do YOU want? What are your goals and aspirations? Make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for someone else's."
* "You're not going to be 'kicked out' of your parents' house. You're an adult, and you're capable of making your own decisions. If you need to stay with your parents for a bit, that's okay. It's not the end of the world."
* "It's okay to not have all the answers right now. You're 22, and you're pregnant. It's a lot to take in. Take your time, and focus on what you need to do to take care of yourself and your baby. You got this."
* "Remember that you're not alone. There are many women who have been in your shoes and have come out the other side. You can do the same. Don't be afraid to reach out for help and support when you need it."

Overall, the advice from the subreddit is encouraging and supportive, urging the OP to prioritize her own needs and desires, and to focus on taking care of herself and her baby. The comments also acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and that it's a normal part of the process to take things one step at a time.

TITLE: I could be the other guy [26M]. She [25 F] wants me, but has a boyfriend (now long distance) of almost 3 years. I need opinions on what I should do

POST: I will try to be brief.
We met, we went out 2-3 times, great chemistry but at time I could feel she would give me mixed signals. I held back, eventually (after 4 dates) asked her to dinner to my place while I made it obvious what my intentions were... she told me about BF... I could see it coming but didnt blame her for it, since our first few dates could have been interpreted as friendly ones (.. as if she didnt know what was going on)... I told her I respect that and backed off. She said shes struggling with it so naturally I have kept myself around, but have not been looking for her, yet we text a couple times a week, and have hung out a few times after that...

Current situation is

- she knows i like her
- I know she likes me
- last time we hung out and i dropped her off she sent a message asking if shes a bad person for wanting to kiss me (i just avoided answering that and said something else related to the night, even though i wanted to say more)
- I am still assuming shes still with the guy. Havent texted or seen her since...

at what point would it be reasonable for me to put pressure on her again? do I just let it run its course and fucking suck it up as long as I can, do I wait for another situation where she clearly wants to be with me, and act on it?

I like this chick, and I feel that if she cheats on her bf with me, I will always have that in the back of my mind if I got in a relationship with her.... but at the same time, I dont wanna wait around indefinitely

TL;DR: I like her, she likes me, but she's with someone else. Should I put pressure on her to make a move or just wait it out?

**OPINIONS FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* **Don't pursue her**: You're not the only one who's been in this situation, and it's not worth the emotional baggage. She's already shown that she's willing to keep you around while still being in a relationship, which is not a healthy dynamic.
* **Let her come to you**: If she's really interested in you, she'll make the first move. Don't put pressure on her, and just enjoy the friendship you have for now.
* **Be honest with yourself**: You're not going to be able to shake off the feeling that she cheated on her boyfriend with you if you do get in a relationship with her. It's better to be honest with yourself and move on.
* **Don't play games**: You're not going to win any points by playing games with her emotions. If you're interested in her, be upfront and honest about it. If she's not interested in being with you, then it's time to move on.
* **Wait for a clear sign**: If she's still with her boyfriend, it's best to wait for a clear sign that she's willing to end things with him before pursuing a relationship with you. Otherwise, you're just going to be stuck in limbo.
* **Don't get too attached**: It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new relationship, but don't get too attached to the idea of being with her. Remember that she's still with someone else, and it's not fair to either of you to pursue a relationship that's not fully committed.

**THE OP'S RESPONSE:**

Thanks for the feedback, guys! I think I've been stuck in this limbo for too long, and I need to take a step back and re-evaluate my feelings. I think I'll take your advice and just enjoy the friendship we have for now, and see where things go. If she's really interested in me, she'll make the first move. And if not, then I'll just have to accept that and move on. Thanks again for your honesty and advice!

TITLE: 22(F) and 29(M) Casually seeing each other, but he keeps asking me to go on romantic dates?

POST: Hi Reddit, long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway account. I am a 22 year-old female and he is a 29 year-old male. We have been casually seeing each other for about six weeks now.

We initially met through a friend at a bar, and things were awkward at first, but we ended up going for a late meal and hitting it off. After we met we began texting quite frequently (maybe once a day) and went on a few dates. We first slept with each other on the third date and it was great. Since then, we have gone on a few dates, that almost always end with us sleeping together. I consider all of this to be casual and we have never discussed a relationship or anything more. 
But here is my issue: he keeps asking me to go on all of these really nice, fancy dinner dates. I do enjoy his company but I do not want to pursue anything more than what we currently have going. He is attractive, generous, and sweet; but we do not seem to have an engaging connection and I got out of a very long and intense relationship at the beginning of the year (so I want some time to be single), among other reasons.
My question is: when would it be an appropriate time for me to bring up my concerns? He invited me to go on a date this week. Should I go and tell him there? Or should I decline and tell him right away that I think these dates are a bit much for our given situation? My personal philosophy has always been don't discuss being serious unless the other person brings it up. He has not brought it up. I guess my biggest concern is that he pays for our dates (I try to pay for my half or my drinks and he never lets me) and it seems unfair if I don't want to be official in the end. He is a great guy and I would like to continue seeing him without any strings attached.

TL;DR: 22F and 29M have been casually seeing each other for 6 weeks. He keeps asking me to go on romantic dates, but I don't want to pursue anything more. When should I bring up my concerns? Should I go on the date and tell him there or decline and tell him right away?

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you should have a conversation with him about your feelings. It's okay to say no to dates if you don't feel like they're a good fit. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoy spending time with you, but I don't feel like we're at a place where we're looking for something serious. Can we just stick to casual hangouts?'"
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's better to be honest with him about your feelings and boundaries. You can also try to reframe the conversation by saying something like, 'I appreciate the effort you're putting into planning these dates, but I'm not really looking for anything romantic right now. Can we find other ways to spend time together that feel more relaxed and casual?'"
* **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should be careful about how you approach this conversation. He might take it as a rejection and stop wanting to see you altogether. Maybe try to find a compromise, like going on a casual date every now and then, but not making it a regular thing. You can also try to set some boundaries, like saying, 'I'd love to hang out with you, but I'm not really up for a fancy dinner date right now. How about we grab coffee or something instead?'"
* **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you should just be honest with him and tell him how you feel. If he's a good guy, he'll respect your boundaries and understand where you're coming from. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoy spending time with you, but I don't feel like we're a good match for a romantic relationship. I think we should just stick to casual hangouts and see where things go.'"

**OP's Follow-up:**

* "Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'm going to take a combination of all your suggestions. I'll try to have a conversation with him about my feelings and boundaries, and see how he reacts. I'll also try to find a compromise, like going on casual dates every now and then. And if that doesn't work out, I'll just be honest with him and tell him how I feel. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: For any Girls out there... Will you help me in my quest for knowledge?

POST: I'm a Soon To Be 18 Year Old male and I have always have had a urge to know "everything"... well, recently I've been wondering what it'd be like to live as a/be a girl. Now, I'm not homosexual in anyway, but my brain just hasn't let up on this simple fact of my urge to learn the "mysteries" of a man. Now, onto my question, Do any one of yall reading know if/how a man can grow breasts (I'm not looking for anything too big, just something to give me an idea). I don't want to do anything costly, I.E Implants, and I don't want to do anything to noticeable/permanent.

TL;DR: I'm a 17 year old male who wants to learn about being a girl, specifically about growing breasts without implants or permanent changes.

REDDIT RESPONSES:

* "Dude, you're 17, take a step back and focus on your education and personal growth. This is not a normal or healthy curiosity. Seek help from a professional."
* "I'm a trans woman and I can tell you that it's not about 'growing breasts' or 'being a girl'. It's about being who you are and living your truth. I don't think you're ready to understand the complexities of gender identity, but I encourage you to learn more about it."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that breasts are not just about physical appearance. They're a part of our bodies, and they're not something to be 'grown' or 'changed' for the sake of curiosity. If you're genuinely interested in learning about being a woman, start by listening to women's experiences and perspectives."
* "I'm a doctor and I can tell you that it's not possible to grow breasts without implants or permanent changes. If you're concerned about your body, I recommend speaking with a healthcare professional who can help you address any underlying issues."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not okay to objectify or fetishize women's bodies. Breasts are not something to be 'grown' or 'changed' for the sake of curiosity or entertainment. If you're genuinely interested in learning about being a woman, start by respecting our autonomy and agency."

This post is an example of a harmful and problematic thread on Reddit. The OP's curiosity about being a girl is not a normal or healthy curiosity, and it's not about "growing breasts" or "being a girl". It's about objectifying and fetishizing women's bodies, which is a form of gender-based violence.

The responses from the Reddit community are a mix of concern, education, and criticism. Some users are trying to educate the OP about gender identity and the complexities of being a woman, while others are expressing concern about the OP's motivations and the potential harm that their curiosity could cause.

Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be a platform for harmful and problematic content, and how important it is for users to be aware of and address these issues. It's also a reminder that gender identity and expression are complex and multifaceted, and that it's important to approach these topics with respect, empathy, and understanding.

TITLE: Trying to keep my brother out of jail

POST: His ex-probation officer called him today to tell him he failed an etg (tests for alcohol consumed in past 72  hours) in April. It is now two months after he was supposed to have been off probation and he now finds out he has a warrant and is looking at a maximum of thirty days. 

So long story short I am trying to raise money for him so that maybe, with a slight bit of luck, I can cut down how many days he has to spend in jail after he is sentenced. Maybe pull the cool scene like in the movies where someone posts bond but he doesn't know who.

My goal is to buy wristbands and sell them for donations. We have A LOT of hoodlum friends in our city and I know I could at least make a couple hundred.

I guy what I am asking of you guys is what should I write? First instinct for me was "fuck cops-free (my bro)". But do you think people will hesitate to buy something like that or jump on it?

Also, any recommendations for who to go through or what type of wristband? I'm thinking the engraved ones like the livestrong ones so they last but they get pricey fast. I looked on Google but I kept feeling the first couple sites were trying real
 hard to fuck me

TL;DR: Trying to raise money to help my brother avoid jail time. Want to sell wristbands for donations. Need help with wording and recommendations for wristbands.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think the 'fuck cops-free' approach might not be the best idea. People might be hesitant to support something that seems anti-authority. Instead, you could try something like 'Support [brother's name]' or 'Help [brother's name] stay out of jail'."
* "I'd suggest going with a more neutral or positive message. Something like 'Support a friend in need' or 'Helping [brother's name] get back on track'."
* "I think engraved wristbands are a great idea! You could also consider doing a custom design with a message or symbol that's meaningful to your brother. Just make sure to check the prices and quality of the wristbands before committing to an order."
* "You could also try reaching out to local businesses or organizations that might be willing to donate or sponsor your wristband campaign. This could help you raise more money and get more visibility for your cause."
* "I'd be happy to help you brainstorm some ideas or provide feedback on your message. Just let me know what you're thinking and I can give you some suggestions!"

**Score:** 2,143 upvotes

**Original Poster's Response:** "Thanks for all the feedback! I think I'm going to go with a more neutral message, like 'Support a friend in need'. I'll also look into custom designs and see what I can find. And yeah, I'll definitely reach out to local businesses to see if they can help out. Thanks again for the help!" (1,013 upvotes)

TITLE: I'm [32 M] with a great [30 F] girl and I want to settle down but never stay satisfied with relationships more than a year or two

POST: My past three relationships have all been about 2 years, and I've ended all of them because of a combination of problems and me losing interest. 

The current girl I'm with has mostly everything I would want in a relationship - but I'm feeling myself starting to lose interest anyway. She does have a fairly bad jealousy problem, but some of it is warranted and I feel that everyone has to have some personal defects which should be forgiven.

One factor which I think contributes to feeling unsatisfied is that I tend to get what my friend calls a "wandering eye." Even though I'm happy with my gf I can't help noticing other girls around and being drawn to them, even catching myself flirting at times. A lot of it is sexual attraction and desire - it seems horrible but after being with my gf almost a year I'm less interested in sex and occasionally get a rush of excitement when I notice another girl showing interest in me. 

I could just date indefinitely but I do want to settle down and have kids. I just always get the feeling that I can't stay satisfied with my relationships, and if I'm getting this restlessness after only a year or two I can't imagine how it would be over the rest of my lifetime. 

An obvious answer would be to decide which is more important, dating different people or settling down, and then have the self control to stick to the decision. It's just that long term I *want* to settle down, but I can never escape the feeling of wanting to pursue other girls. A few years back I told someone older this and they said "you must not be ready," but I can't help feeling like this isn't going away, and I really would like to start a family.

TL;DR: I'm 32, in a 2-year relationship, but I'm already feeling restless and losing interest. I have a "wandering eye" and get attracted to other girls, even though I'm happy with my current girlfriend. I want to settle down and have kids, but I'm worried that my inability to stay satisfied with relationships will hold me back.

---

This post is a great example of a common problem in relationships, where the individual struggles with feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction, despite having a great partner. The OP (original poster) is aware of his flaws and is seeking advice on how to overcome them and achieve his goal of settling down.

The post highlights several key issues:

1. Lack of commitment: The OP has a history of ending relationships after 2 years, which suggests that he may not be willing to make a long-term commitment.
2. Infidelity: The OP admits to having a "wandering eye" and getting attracted to other girls, which is a significant threat to his current relationship.
3. Unresolved issues: The OP's jealousy problem with his current girlfriend is not fully addressed, and he seems to be aware that he needs to work on this issue.
4. Unclear priorities: The OP wants to settle down and have kids, but he is also drawn to the idea of dating different people. He needs to clarify his priorities and make a decision about what he wants.

The post also raises questions about the OP's motivations and values. Is he truly interested in settling down and having a family, or is he just looking for a way to justify his own desires and impulses? Does he value his current relationship and is willing to work on it, or is he already looking for an excuse to end it?

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities and challenges that can arise in relationships, and the importance of self-reflection and communication in overcoming these issues.

TITLE: Thought I had an offer: Did my other recruiter screw me over?

POST: I've been working with a recruiter. I lost contact with him 1 month ago.
I applied to another job through recruiter #2. Had an interview last week, went very well. Expected an offer on Friday (that's when they said they would contact me)

Today I get a call from recruiter #1, asking me my situation. I tell him I might have an offer and may not need his services. He asks "mind if i ask which position and company?" I tell him (I don't know why I did).

A couple hours later, I get a call from recruiter #2 saying I didn't get the job. WTF. He says he has no idea why, since I had such a great interview.

TL;DR: Recruiter #1 asks me about my job situation, I tell him I might have an offer. He asks which position and company. Recruiter #2 tells me I didn't get the job, despite a great interview.

What do I do? Should I be mad at recruiter #1? Did he screw me over?

---

**Comments:**

* "Recruiter #1 is a total jerk. He's trying to get info out of you to sabotage your chances with recruiter #2. Don't work with him again."
* "I think recruiter #1 is just trying to stay in the loop. He's not necessarily trying to screw you over, but he's definitely not looking out for your best interests."
* "You should be mad at recruiter #1, but also at recruiter #2 for not being honest with you about the outcome of the interview. Both recruiters are unprofessional."
* "I think you should just focus on the job you really want and forget about the recruiters. They're just trying to make a commission off of you."
* "Recruiter #1 is probably just trying to get a feel for the market and see what other opportunities are out there. He's not necessarily trying to sabotage you, but he's definitely not being transparent about his intentions."
* "You should report both recruiters to the job board or the company they're working with. They're both unprofessional and need to be held accountable."
* "I think you should just take a step back and re-evaluate your job search strategy. Working with recruiters can be a gamble, and it's not always worth the risk."

---

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments. I'm still trying to process everything. I think I'm going to take a step back and re-evaluate my job search strategy. I don't think I'm going to work with recruiters again. I'm going to focus on finding a job on my own and building relationships with people in my industry. Thanks for the advice and support!"

TITLE: I [18M] see/ remember only the good parts of our 3 year relationship while she [18F] sees and remembers only the bad parts

POST: My gf and I dated happily throughout high school and we're now doing long distance in college. We've been having some issues because she feels like I haven't done her much good.

While I look back on our years together and see love, happiness, hand holding, kissing, and everything nice she sees lies, fights, separation, and everything bad.

How can I help her see my point of view? Bringing up good memories and feelings can only make her happy for a night. Most of the bad things about our relationship is stemmed from her not being able to let anything bad that's ever happened with us go. She just feels sad with me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have different perspectives on our 3-year relationship. I only remember the good parts, while she only remembers the bad. How can I help her see my point of view?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Hey OP, I think it's great that you're trying to see the good in your relationship, but it's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend has a valid perspective. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with her about how you both feel? It might be helpful to make a list of the good and bad memories together and see if you can find common ground."
2. **relationshipgoals**: "I think it's interesting that you mention bringing up good memories only makes her happy for a night. It sounds like she might be stuck in a pattern of negative thinking. Have you tried asking her what she needs from you to feel more positive about your relationship? Sometimes people just need to feel heard and validated."
3. **skeptical_sam**: "OP, I'm not sure it's possible to 'help' someone see your point of view, especially if it's rooted in different perspectives. Maybe try focusing on understanding where she's coming from instead of trying to change her perspective. Ask her what specifically is bothering her and try to address those issues together."
4. **romantic_at_heart**: "I think it's sweet that you're trying to hold onto the good memories, but it's also important to acknowledge that relationships are complex and messy. Maybe try having a conversation about how you both can work together to move forward and grow as individuals and as a couple."
5. **realistic_ruth**: "OP, I think you're being a bit unrealistic if you think you can just 'help' your girlfriend see things from your perspective. Relationships are about compromise and understanding each other's perspectives, not about changing each other's minds. Maybe try focusing on finding common ground and working together to build a stronger relationship."

"Thanks for all the comments! I think you're all right, I was being a bit too focused on trying to change her perspective. I'll try to have a more open and honest conversation with her about how we both feel and see if we can find common ground. And maybe I'll try to ask her what she needs from me to feel more positive about our relationship. Thanks for the advice!"

TITLE: [Oklahoma] Contract Dispute

POST: I'll try to keep it short for you all. This is in Oklahoma.

Before we started building we agreed upon the terms and signed two contracts. We signed a Construction Agreement and Specification Agreement. The first one lines out the overall terms of the contract, the second one lines out the specifications that the home is to be built to (construction materials, quality, etc). Both of these documents have a total sales price listed on them, however the price is different on each one. The Construction Agreement has the price listed at $200K, which is $6K higher than the price that is listed on the Spec Agreement.

The main dispute we are having is over a septic system. When we entered into the agreement we agreed that I was going to install the septic myself and save us $6K. However after construction started we had a hiccup with our guy and we ended up letting the builder install it for us.

On the Spec Agreement (the one with the lower price) he actually has in there that one of the things he agrees to is to install a septic tank, even though when the contract was signed he wasn't going to do that. This Spec Agreement says the sales price of the home with him installing septic is $194K.

When I saw the discrepancy in prices I thought he'd just forgotten to take the $6K off of one contract, but not the other. When I talked to him about it he said it was a typo and the price on the Master Agreement (the higher price) is the correct price and the price on the Spec Agreement is a typo, plain and simple.
What he is trying to do now is to charge us the higher price ($200K) plus an extra $6K for installing the septic. I'm not trying to get anything for free here, I'm just wanting to be fair.

TL;DR: We signed two contracts with different prices listed. The main dispute is over a septic system that was installed by the builder instead of me. The builder is trying to charge us the higher price plus an extra $6K for installing the septic.

QUESTION: What are my rights in this situation? Should I be paying the higher price or the lower price? Is there anything I can do to resolve this dispute?

**Response from a lawyer:**

Thank you for reaching out to r/legaladvice. I'll do my best to provide you with some guidance on your situation.

Firstly, it's important to note that the contracts you signed are binding agreements, and you should take them seriously. However, it's also important to recognize that there may be errors or discrepancies in the contracts that need to be addressed.

In your case, the main issue seems to be the discrepancy in prices between the two contracts. The Construction Agreement has a higher price listed, while the Spec Agreement has a lower price. Additionally, the Spec Agreement mentions that the builder will install the septic system, which was not initially agreed upon.

From a legal perspective, it's possible that the builder may be trying to take advantage of the situation and charge you the higher price. However, it's also possible that the lower price listed in the Spec Agreement is an error or a typo.

To resolve this dispute, I would recommend the following:

1. Review the contracts carefully: Take a close look at both contracts and make sure you understand what was agreed upon. Check for any errors or discrepancies that may have been missed.
2. Communicate with the builder: Reach out to the builder and explain the situation. Be clear and concise about the discrepancy in prices and the issue with the septic system. Try to resolve the issue amicably and find a mutually beneficial solution.
3. Seek legal advice: If the builder is unwilling to work with you to resolve the issue, you may want to consider seeking legal advice. A lawyer can help you understand your rights and options, and may be able to negotiate a settlement on your behalf.
4. Consider mediation: If you're unable to resolve the issue through direct communication, you may want to consider mediation. A mediator can help facilitate a conversation between you and the builder to find a mutually beneficial solution.

In terms of your rights, it's important to recognize that you have a contract that you signed, and you should take it seriously. However, it's also important to recognize that there may be errors or discrepancies in the contract that need to be addressed.

Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on the specific circumstances of your situation. I would recommend seeking legal advice to get a better understanding of your rights and options.

**Additional comments from the community:**

* "I would recommend seeking legal advice as soon as possible. The builder may be trying to take advantage of the situation, and you need to protect your interests."
* "Make sure you have a clear understanding of what was agreed upon in the contracts. If there are any errors or discrepancies, you need to address them immediately."
* "Don't be afraid to negotiate. If the builder is unwilling to work with you, you may need to seek legal action to resolve the issue."
* "Consider mediation as an option. It may be a more cost-effective and less confrontational way to resolve the issue."
* "Remember, you have a contract that you signed, and you need to take it seriously. However, it's also important to recognize that there may be errors or discrepancies that need to be addressed."

TITLE: Need help to get away from bully bosses

POST: Im in my early 20s and I make loudspeakers and amplifiers for a living. I have worked here for around a year, learning how to do the job from scratch with no experience. My two bosses are awful people who shout, swear and pretty much make my life hell. It is a very skilled job but I am paid minimum wage, less than people who work in supermarkets etc! I was told after 6 months I would be given a pay rise but this did not happen. I decided not to bring it up and just try and get a new job. I have been trying for months now but to no avail.

On the 4th of august I broke my ankle, meaning i literally cannot work as I am required to stand for 9 hours a day. My boss has rang me numerous times basically bribing me into coming into work, telling me how I am not playing ball and basically not committed to the company. This spurred me on to apply for jobs, and I have an interview for an admin job tomorrow. Can anyone give me some advice? 

Sorry about the wall of text....

TL;DR: Need help to get away from bully bosses, paid minimum wage, broke my ankle and now being pressured to come back to work. Help with job search and interview advice would be greatly appreciated!

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely unacceptable to be treated like that, especially when you're injured. Don't worry about the job search, it's normal to take time. Just focus on getting better and finding a job that treats you with respect. For the interview, just be yourself, be honest and show enthusiasm. Remember, you're not obligated to take any job that doesn't make you happy. Good luck!"
2. **u/jobsrock**: "OP, I'm a recruiter and I can tell you that your situation is not uncommon. Unfortunately, some employers think they can get away with treating employees poorly. Don't worry about the pay rise, it's not uncommon for companies to make promises they don't intend to keep. As for the interview, make sure to highlight your transferable skills and be prepared to talk about your experience. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions about the company culture and what they do to support their employees. Good luck with your interview!"
3. **u/anonymous123**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's not your fault that you got injured, and it's not your fault that your bosses are awful. Don't let them guilt trip you into coming back to work. You need to prioritize your health and well-being. For the interview, just be honest and show your skills. Remember, you're not obligated to take any job that doesn't make you happy. And if you do get the job, don't be afraid to negotiate your salary. You deserve to be paid fairly for your work."
4. **u/throwaway456**: "OP, I'm a former employee of the company you work for. I can tell you that the company culture is toxic and the owners are not interested in treating employees with respect. I'm glad you're getting out of there. For the interview, just be yourself and show your skills. Remember, you're not obligated to take any job that doesn't make you happy. And if you do get the job, don't be afraid to speak up if you see any signs of bullying or harassment. Good luck with your interview!"

* OP is experiencing bullying and harassment from their bosses and is seeking advice on how to get away from the situation.
* The comments offer support and advice on how to navigate the job search and interview process.

TITLE: Me (19F) hung up on (20M)...still

POST: I'll try to keep this short and sweet. In the last few weeks of term at college I met this guy. We were basically unstoppable together. Spent every waking hour together, went on adventures, were a big bundle of energy, so alike in every way, amazing amazing sex. 

Problem was, he's a pro skier and is gone for 3/4s of the year training nonstop. We didn't talk about things before we left, but kept talking on the phone, texting for a while. 

Then we decided that we had to break things off. It would be almost a year before we would be in the same place again. Skiing is incredibly emotionally consuming. It was fine. I understood, it was for the best.

But it has been a month since we decided to break it off. It doesn't feel like I'm getting over him. Sure, I have a few moments here or there that are temporarily alright, but they are just tiny distractions from the fact that I miss him. We've barely talked in the past weeks. I'm so afraid that I will never find anyone that gives me such energy, that fits with me so wonderfully. I don't even know if I want to get over him. I don't know if he wants to get over me.

TL;DR: I'm 19F and I hung up on my 20M boyfriend because he's a pro skier and we wouldn't see each other for almost a year. We broke things off, but I'm still really struggling to get over him. We haven't talked much since then and I'm worried I'll never find someone like him again.

TITLE: Moving From One Coast To Another - fml :(

POST: Wasn't really sure where to ask, but r/travel made the most sense from what I could find.. anyways..

I'm moving from NYC to either Seattle or San Francisco in June, and am scratching my head as how the hell to actually do it. Right now I'm planning on road-tripping it with a couple friends (one who's flying over for the trip, another moving from ATL who may be using a U-Haul). I don't have a lot of things to move- mostly boxes of things I plan on shipping, and then a bit more (valuables, etc.) that I'd just take along for the ride. Basically, I want to travel light, but will take the things more fragile and whatnot.

I guess I'm looking for insight on the following:

-Rental companies (for cars)

-Does it make sense to even rent a car for that distance (buy used??)

-Ways to save a buck in lodging (I love camping!)

-Shipping companies; items (clothes- ship most of them, or take?)

I don't know. This is such a new thing for me. I guess if any one has attempted and completed this crazy thing that is moving across the country, any insight would be of help.

TL;DR: Moving from NYC to either Seattle or San Francisco in June, looking for advice on how to make the most of the trip, specifically on rental cars, lodging, and shipping items.

* "I did this exact trip last year and it was an amazing adventure! I rented a car from Enterprise and it was super easy. Make sure to book in advance, especially for the long-distance rentals. As for lodging, I camped a lot, but also stayed in some awesome hostels. For shipping, I used UPS and it was super reliable. Just make sure to pack your clothes in sturdy boxes and label them clearly. Oh, and don't forget to take breaks and enjoy the scenery!"
* "I'm a Seattle native and I've made this trip many times. I always recommend renting a car from Budget or Avis. They have a wide range of vehicles and are usually pretty affordable. For lodging, you can't go wrong with camping, but if you're looking for something a bit more luxurious, consider staying in a hotel or Airbnb. As for shipping, I've used both UPS and FedEx and they're both reliable. Just make sure to track your packages and keep an eye on them."

TITLE: Accidental non-petty revenge.

POST: This is the story of how my plan for a petty revenge accidentally got my victim arrested.

So I met an old bully at a night club a year or two ago, and he came up to me and tried to be all pally, despite the fact that he made a few years of my life hell. I told him to fuck off, and went on with my partying, but his mere presence ruined my night, so I planned some petty revenge.

I knew the owner of the club, and some of the guards, so I told a guard that I thought he might be dealing drugs in the bathrooms to get him thrown out. Little did I know that he was selling drugs in the bathrooms, and things get a bit out of hand.

The guards check it out, and realize that he is selling drugs, so they try to stop him. He punches one guard and locks himself in one of the stalls (and even though he is in the bathroom he does not think of flushing the drugs).

The police comes and while arresting him, he breaks one of their noses. He was charged and convicted of aggravated assault, assaulting a public official, resisting arrest, selling cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and weed.

TL;DR: I planned a petty revenge, but accidentally got my bully arrested and charged with multiple crimes.

EDITS:

* Added a TL;DR
* Changed the title to "Accidental non-petty revenge" to better reflect the story.

This post is an example of a "non-petty revenge" story, where the original intention was to cause harm or discomfort to someone, but the outcome was much more severe and unintended. The story is presented in a lighthearted and humorous tone, with the author acknowledging the unintended consequences of their actions. The post has received over 10,000 upvotes and has been shared widely on social media. It has also sparked a lot of discussion and debate about the ethics of revenge and the potential consequences of one's actions.

TITLE: Me [23M] been on a path of self-improvement but struggling with the opposite sex

POST: I've never been a big time ladies man or anything but I've generally had a decent love life, my fair share of relationships, girls having crushes on me, etc. A year and a half ago I had a bad breakup and realized I didn't like who I had become. I was out of shape, emotionally unstable and generally unhappy.

So with this introspection I set on a path of self improvement. I work out daily now, did some therapy, graduated uni and got a great new job and even improved my wardrobe. I've made new friends and reconnected with old ones (male and female), and I've been on more fun adventures in the past year than I probably had been my whole life.

Yet somehow with all that, I feel like I'm become less attractive to women. I haven't done anything sexual with a woman since my breakup a year and half ago (hooked up with my ex a couple times post breakup but that's it). For a long time I didn't let it bother me as I was focusing on myself and making myself a whole happy person, but now that I'm finally 100% where I want to be, it's starting to erode my confidence and almost hurt my progress. I'm the type of guy who's been to bothered by my lack of height (5'7) but now I'm suddenly really self conscious about it since it's the only thing I CANT change about myself. Is it just that in this tinder-age sex revolution some of us are just bound to left behind? Am I self-sabotaging myself somehow? Is there some part of my self-improvement that I'm missing?

TL;DR: I've been on a path of self-improvement for a year and a half, but despite feeling like a better person, I'm struggling to attract women and it's affecting my confidence. I'm wondering if it's just a matter of being left behind in this modern dating landscape or if I'm missing something in my self-improvement journey.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 5'7" and you're worried about your height? You're a great guy, focus on your positives and stop letting societal standards dictate your self-worth."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're focusing on your physical appearance and that's not what women care about. They care about your personality, your sense of humor, and your values. You're a catch, don't sell yourself short."
* "I've been in a similar situation and I think it's because you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're trying to be perfect and it's not working. Just relax, be yourself, and let things happen naturally. You don't need to change who you are to attract someone."
* "I think you're missing the point of self-improvement. It's not about changing yourself to fit someone else's standards, it's about becoming the best version of yourself. You're doing that, and that's something to be proud of. Don't worry about what others think, focus on your own happiness and fulfillment."
* "I think you should try online dating. It's a great way to meet new people and you can be yourself without feeling pressure to conform to societal standards. Just be honest and authentic, and you'll find someone who appreciates you for who you are."
* "I think you're being too focused on the physical aspect of dating. You're a great guy, but you're not going to find someone who loves you just because of your looks. You need to focus on building connections with people, and that takes time and effort. Don't give up, keep putting yourself out there and eventually you'll find someone who loves you for who you are."

TITLE: Work advice

POST: Me 26 F, My 2 co-workers 45 F.  I've been at my job for 3 months and management is very impressed with my work.  So impressed, that they've put me in charge of one woman and they want me to learn another woman's job.  These two women have been at the company for 3 years and it's quite obvious that they hate me.  They've yelled at me, told co-workers that I don't know what I'm doing and are insulting me in Armenian.  I'm trying to be as nice as possible about the whole situation.  It's understandable why they are upset, but I'm having a hard time not taking it personally.  Advice, please?

**Top comments:**

1. "OP, you're doing great! It's normal for people to feel threatened when someone new comes in and does a better job. Don't take it personally, just focus on your work and try to build a rapport with your coworkers. Maybe try to find common ground or ask them about their interests outside of work. Remember, you're not there to make friends, but to do your job to the best of your ability."
2. "I would suggest talking to management about the situation. It's not okay for coworkers to be yelling and insulting you, and it's not okay for them to be making your life miserable. You have the right to work in a respectful environment, and management should be taking steps to address this. Don't be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself."

TITLE: I [18M] kissed my girlfriend's [17F] close friend while we were on a break. I confessed this to her and she doesn't trust me anymore.

POST: I was on a break with my girlfriend after some difficulties and I kissed one of her close friends. Although I thought I would not be getting back with my girlfriend, I regretted it immediately. Sometime afterwards I got back together with my girlfriend and I told her last night what had happened as I couldn't deal with the guilt. She started crying and said she has lost all trust in me. I feel sick. Just to be clear, she was seeing other people on the break too. I guess since it's one of her close friends I crossed a boundary. What is my next move? I hope you can help!

TL;DR: I kissed my girlfriend's close friend while we were on a break, confessed to her, and now she doesn't trust me anymore. What do I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're lucky she's still talking to you. You broke a major trust boundary. You need to work on rebuilding that trust. Start by being honest and transparent about your actions and feelings. It's not going to be easy, but it's the only way to move forward."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous commenter. You need to take responsibility for your actions and work on rebuilding trust. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend was seeing other people on the break too. You can't compare your actions to hers, but you can acknowledge that she was also not faithful. Maybe have an open and honest conversation about what you both did during the break and how you can move forward together."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure if I would have stayed with you after finding out about the kiss. You crossed a major boundary and it's not something that can be easily forgotten. You need to think about whether you're willing to put in the work to rebuild trust and if your girlfriend is willing to forgive you. If not, maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
4. **u/relationshipcounselor**: "I'm a relationship counselor and I have to say that this is a classic case of a boundary violation. You need to take responsibility for your actions and work on rebuilding trust. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend was also not faithful during the break. Maybe consider couples therapy to work through these issues and figure out if you're both willing to put in the work to move forward together."
5. **u/anonymous_user**: "I'm not sure if I would have stayed with you either. You kissed your girlfriend's close friend, that's a major betrayal of trust. You need to think about whether you're willing to put in the work to rebuild trust and if your girlfriend is willing to forgive you. If not, maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, but most users agree that the OP (original poster) needs to take responsibility for his actions and work on rebuilding trust with his girlfriend. Some users suggest that the OP and his girlfriend should have an open and honest conversation about what happened during the break and how they can move forward together. Others are more skeptical and think that the OP may have crossed a boundary that is too difficult to recover from. Overall, the comments suggest that the OP needs to be honest and transparent about his actions and feelings, and that rebuilding trust will require effort and commitment from both parties.

TITLE: The worst person is in my math class. What do I do?!

POST: This semester, I'm in a higher level math class, which is a pretty OK course. It's a class of maybe 30 students. I (and quite a few of the other folks in my class) have found it increasingly difficult to concentrate, however, due to one individual. This guy is a non-traditional student. He sits in the front of the room every day, but there's always a small ring of empty seats around him because he has serious personal hygiene issues. B.O. combined with the smell of a pack's worth of cigarette smoke emanates from his body.

To make matters worse, it seems that he has some sort of autism. He'll rock back and forth in his seat during class which is both visually (he sits in the front) and audibly distracting (the seats creak).

The cherry on the cake, however, is that for long stretches of class he will breathe exclusively through his mouth. I have no idea whether this is a health-related issue or a psychological thing, but his breathing is loud enough to make it hard to hear the (albeit soft-spoken) professor.

What do I do, Reddit? These seem like issues that shouldn't really exist, but can anything be done?

TL;DR: Worst person in my math class has B.O., smokes, rocks in seat, and breathes loudly. What do I do?!

This post is an example of a common phenomenon on Reddit, where users share their personal struggles and ask for advice from the community.

TITLE: Is it insensitive for me (17f) to break up with my boyfriend (20m) because he's moving away to help his mother?

POST: I'm copying this from /r/relationship_advice

My boyfriends home state is Michigan and he recently (in October) moved here, to NC. We met soon after he moved and we started dating on Thanksgiving night. Last week his mom got into a car accident (minor injuries to her) and is getting sick (I don't know what with). She has to either fix her car or buy a new one, and she's already late on rent. So my bf is moving back home to help her out.

He told me he wants to get her in a better financial situation, and get himself into a better one too. I understand it fully, and I don't blame him one bit. I just don't want to be in another (I've been in two!) long distance relationship. I can't handle them well. And I know we won't be able to see each other much, and I just feel like its a bad idea. But at the same time I feel a bit selfish and insensitive. Am i?

TL;DR: Boyfriend moving away to help his mom, I don't want to be in another long distance relationship, but I feel bad for breaking up with him.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being very reasonable. You've been in two long distance relationships already and it's not fair to put yourself through that again. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You're not being insensitive, you're being honest with yourself."
* "I agree with the above comment. You're not being selfish, you're being realistic. Long distance relationships are hard and it's okay to acknowledge that. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship, and if that means ending things with your boyfriend, then so be it."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you understand why he's making this decision, but that you're not comfortable with the idea of being in another long distance relationship. It's possible that he may be willing to find a compromise or make changes to make the relationship work, but if not, then it may be best to end things."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on your own feelings and not considering your boyfriend's perspective. He's making this decision to help his mom, and it's not just about you. You should try to understand where he's coming from and have a conversation about how you can support each other through this difficult time."
* "I think you're being very selfish. You're not considering the fact that your boyfriend is making this decision to help his mom, and that it's not just about you. You should try to be more understanding and supportive of his decision, even if it means being in a long distance relationship."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all for your comments! I really appreciate your honesty and understanding. I think I was worried about being judged for being'selfish' or 'insensitive', but it seems like most of you are on the same page as me. I do think I need to have a conversation with my boyfriend about my feelings and concerns, and I'll try to be more understanding of his perspective too. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: Today, I realized why I am so calm and collected during times of chaos and disagreement. My body turns anger into sadness, reducing me into a sobing mess every time I get angry. What horrible decisions does your mind make for you that you can't control?

POST: From what I can remember, my childhood environment was filled with distrust, yelling, judging, anger, confrontation and control, 

any attempt at voicing my opinions or becoming angry was useless and ended up worse then it needed to.

Since then any sign of anger was channeled away and eventually filled with sadness and severe depression. I'm not an angry person, nor do i concern myself with things that stress me out, my life is vary vary stress free.

Recently after I looked back on what brought me here and why my body reacts the way I do its pretty clear. Any immediate bout of anger instantly turns to sadness and tears involuntarily.

TL;DR: I'm a master of turning anger into sadness, reducing me to a sobbing mess. What horrible decisions does your mind make for you that you can't control?

TITLE: 23M- girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. Thinking of getting an escort- good/bad idea?

POST: For the first couple weeks I was so depressed I could only sleep 1-4 hrs a day and couldn't stop overthinking things. Now for the past couple days I've been sleeping okay and have started thinking forwards. I still miss her, am a bit sad, and have dreams of her almost every day. Though the majority of the day now I'm fine.

I've also been really horny lately as I haven't done it for a month now. Am thinking of getting an escort. I was looking to get into a one nighter or hookup for the past week but have had no luck. No matches on Tinder really brought down my self-esteem too though I think I'm above average looking. Feeling stressed out, should I get an escort for a night or will it be a huge mistake?

TL;DR: Broke up with girlfriend of 2 years, feeling horny and considering getting an escort for a night. Good/bad idea?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're looking for a quick fix to fill the void left by your ex. Getting an escort won't solve your emotional issues, it'll just temporarily distract you from them. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing before jumping into something like that."
* "I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but you need to be honest with yourself about why you're doing it. Are you doing it because you're genuinely interested in the experience or because you're trying to replace your ex? If it's the latter, it's not going to work out well for you."
* "I've been in a similar situation and I ended up getting an escort. It was a huge mistake. I felt guilty, anxious, and it didn't even satisfy my physical needs. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing before jumping into something like that."
* "I think it's a good idea to get an escort if you're feeling horny and it's not going to interfere with your emotional healing. Just make sure you're being safe and responsible."
* "I'm a woman and I've had experiences with escorts. I can tell you that it's not worth it. It's not a real connection and it's not going to fill the void left by your ex. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing before jumping into something like that."

Overall, the comments are mixed, but the majority of them advise against getting an escort as a way to cope with the emotional pain of a recent breakup. Many commenters suggest that the experience will not provide a genuine connection or satisfaction, and may even lead to feelings of guilt, anxiety, or regret. Some commenters do suggest that getting an escort could be a good idea if it's done responsibly and safely, but the overall tone is cautionary. The post itself is a good example of how people may turn to external solutions to cope with emotional pain, and how important it is to prioritize self-reflection and healing before making decisions that may have long-term consequences.

TITLE: 11 years since my heart transplant, and i'm tired of medication's side effects

POST: When I had my heart transplant i was 12. I remember I was always tired and i can't breath properly so my mother took me to the ospital. We found out that my heart was larger than normal, they put me on transplant list and 3 weeks later there was an heart available for me.
Now I'm 23 and I almost spent the majority of my life with a new heart. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes i feel like it's an heavy bag on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel guilty, because when i was sick i prayed for a new heart (and it means that i prayed that a child would die to take me alive).
Sometimes I just feel "normal" and then reality comes back and hit me in my face with a new complication (my medication take me alive but they have a lot of side effects)
I don't plan my life, I just live it day by day, knowing that one of this days my doctors can tell me some bad news.
If i must describe what i feel, it will be a mix of angriness, resignation and a little bit of fear, knowing that life took my innocence away when i was a kid.
Sorry for my bad english but I'm italian

TL;DR: I'm 23 and I had a heart transplant when I was 12. I'm tired of the medication's side effects and I feel like I'm living day by day, never knowing what the future holds. I'm angry, resigned and a little scared.

TITLE: What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about?

POST: I'm not sure if I should be ashamed or proud, but I'm going to share a ridiculous lie I told when I was a teenager.

I was at a party and someone asked me if I had ever gone skydiving. I had never even been on a plane before, let alone gone skydiving. But I didn't want to seem boring, so I told them that I had gone skydiving not once, not twice, but THRICE! I even went so far as to make up a fake story about how I had gone skydiving in different countries and had even gotten a special "skydiving certificate" from the government.

The worst part is that I actually started to believe my own lie. I would tell the story to my friends and family, and they would all ooh and ahh over my supposed bravery. It wasn't until years later, when I was talking to a friend who had actually gone skydiving, that I realized how ridiculous my lie was.

So, what's the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about? Share your stories and let's commiserate about our own ridiculous fibs!

TL;DR: I told a ridiculous lie about going skydiving when I was a teenager and it got out of hand. I'm sharing my story to see what other ridiculous lies people have told. Share your own stories and let's laugh about our own fibs!

TITLE: [28/f] How do I become relationship-type and more feminine?

POST: I don't think I'm relationship-type.  I'm also insecure about my level of femininity.  
Men that I meet (work/socially) are hardly ever single.  The ones who are and that I get to know, I almost always develop a crush, but try so hard to hide it that they just end up becoming a good friend of mine.  They usually make it clear that they are attracted to me, but I disregard it.  I make it so easy to be comfortable with, the start sharing secrets and life stories and I do the same.  And that's where I know I screw up.  I also think I am headstrong, brazen and outspoken.  I'm very opinionated.  Also, I'm not as feminine (clothing) as other women.  I wear makeup, do cute hairstyles, wear lipstick, do my nails, wear jewelry, I have a perfume collection, etc.  But I do not wear skirts, dresses, or heels and open-toed shoes.  I think it is all beautiful, but I feel so alien like with it on.   I'm not a tomboy, I just don't like super girly attire.  I've had a male friend tell me that he and a lot of other men would date me if I was more feminine and submissive.  
Also, I've dated a couple of guys in the past who refuse to get serious with me.  They don't take me seriously romantically.  It seems like they'll try to hook up (9/10 times I'm not putting out) but not make anything exclusive.  I'm starting to feel real insecure.  Am I crazy and just don't know it?  Do men really only date super feminine women?  Am I too friendly?  How can I become more comfortable?  What do men like?  I'm at a age where I want to be in a relationship and fall in love, but I'm not sure if someone will ever accept me for me.  Sorry for the pity party.  I've been single for so long, I have to accept it is my fault.

TL;DR: I'm a 28-year-old woman who's never been in a serious relationship. I'm insecure about my femininity and feel like I'm not "relationship-type". I'm headstrong, outspoken, and don't wear traditional feminine clothing. I've had guys tell me they'd date me if I was more feminine and submissive. I'm starting to feel insecure and wonder if men only date super feminine women. How can I become more comfortable and attractive to men?

**Top comments:**

1. **Feminine doesn't mean you have to wear skirts and heels**: You're already doing a lot of things that are considered "feminine" like wearing makeup, doing your hair, and wearing jewelry. It's okay to not wear traditional feminine clothing if that's not your style. Focus on being confident and comfortable in your own skin.
2. **You're not alone**: Many women struggle with feeling like they're not "relationship-type" or that they're not feminine enough. It's okay to be different and it doesn't mean you're not worthy of love. Keep being yourself and don't try to change who you are to fit someone else's idea of what a woman should be.
3. **Men are attracted to confidence and authenticity**: Instead of trying to change who you are to attract men, focus on being confident and authentic. When you're comfortable in your own skin, you're more likely to attract someone who likes you for who you are.
4. **It's okay to take your time**: You don't have to rush into a relationship. Take your time and focus on getting to know yourself and what you want. When you're ready, you'll attract someone who is right for you.
5. **You're not too friendly**: Being friendly and approachable is a great quality. Don't change who you are to fit someone else's idea of what a woman should be. Keep being yourself and don't be afraid to show your personality.

**Additional comments:**

* **You're not alone in feeling insecure**: Many women feel insecure about their appearance or their relationship status. Remember that you're not alone and that it's okay to feel this way.
* **Focus on self-care**: Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness. When you're happy and confident, you're more likely to attract someone who likes you for who you are.
* **Don't compare yourself to others**: Don't compare yourself to other women or try to fit into someone else's idea of what a woman should be. You're unique and special, and that's what makes you attractive.
* **You're worthy of love**: Remember that you're worthy of love and respect, regardless of your appearance or your relationship status. Don't settle for someone who doesn't treat you like you deserve to be treated. Keep being yourself and don't give up on finding someone who loves you for who you are.

TITLE: TIFU by visiting an ex

POST: This is a throwaway.

I dated a girl from January to August of last year.  We were pretty intimate, and had sex regularly that often ended with me finishing inside her. (It was mutually enjoyed, as she was on contraceptives.)  We had a pretty nasty breakup, and we didn't talk for awhile. 

In May of this year, she sent me a random text apologizing for things she said.  Feeling pretty frisky (and I suppose somewhat lonely), I offered to meet up and catch up with her.  I had no intention of rekindling our relationship, but hey, possible sex.  So we met at a bar, and I ended up going to her house.  We had sex in our normal fashion and proceeded to stay over for the night.  The next morning, we discussed our situation, and I confessed I didn't want to advance our relationship.  She somewhat reluctantly agreed.

I've been seeing a new girl for about a month now, and things are amazing!  We click on every level, she's gorgeous, and I find myself thinking about her constantly.  I don't think I've ever been so intrigued by somebody after such a short amount of time. I think I've found the perfect girl.  Except...

Today my ex called me.  She's pregnant.  She had secretly been off birth control for awhile, and she admitted that she thought a kid would be a way to "keep us from fighting" and to "make us close again."

Yep.  I think I fucked up.  I don't know what to do, or how this girl I'm seeing will take it.

TL;DR: I had sex with my ex, who's now pregnant, and I'm seeing someone new.  I don't know how to handle this situation.

TITLE: Me [29 M] with my GF [25 F] She broke up with me, I found out she was cheating. Should I confront her?

POST: OK so first the background details. We've been together 4 years and live together. I truly love her and had planned on proposing to her later this year. 2 weeks ago she broke up with me over a silly fight. Said she need time to herself blah blah blah. I was devastated as I didn't see it coming. The weird part is she currently has been living with me after the breakup and will be here until next week which is when she will move out.

Now for the juicy part. Today i opened her laptop and she was signed into her email. I found numerous chat logs of her and a male co worker talking sexually and she even had sent him a nude photo. These texts go back to November. Normally i don't like to snoop around so I feel super guilty, but I had been having suspicions all along. I remember about 3 months back her entire attitude had changed and she became more distant which is around the time she had also mentioned that there was a guy in her office who liked her. This is the guys shes been chatting with.

Now, even though we are broken up I don't know what to do. Should I tell her I know? Even though it means exposing myself as having gone through her email? Should I just let it go? I feel like shit because this coworker of hers is married and basically I think instigated this whole ordeal for her to break up with me? Either way I'm at a loss.

TL;DR: GF broke up with me 2 weeks ago, I found out she's been cheating on me with a coworker, should I confront her about it?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you need to confront her. You deserve to know the truth and she needs to own up to her actions. Don't worry about exposing yourself as snooping, she already broke your trust by cheating on you."
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to have a calm and honest conversation with her about what you found. Don't threaten or yell, just state the facts and ask her why she did what she did."
* "I'm not sure if you should confront her. You're already hurt and vulnerable from the breakup. Maybe it's better to just take some time for yourself and focus on healing. You don't need to add more drama to your life."
* "You should definitely confront her. But make sure you're prepared for any reaction she might have. She might deny it, or try to make excuses, or even get defensive. Be calm and firm, and don't let her manipulate you."
* "I think you should just let it go. You're already broken up, and confronting her about it might just lead to more drama and stress. You deserve better than that. Just focus on moving on and finding someone who truly loves and respects you."

TITLE: My girlfriend [21/F] is having a mental breakdown, how can I [21/M] help her?

POST: My girlfriend is going through a rough patch in her life right now. She is a university student doing an extremely hard subject. She has a lot of pressure on herself right now due to fear of letting her parents down.

Two weeks ago she started having obsessional thoughts about death and not existing. This prospect scared her to the point of having several panic attacks every day. She isn't religious and does not believe in an afterlife. Going to church seemed to help at first, but she is simply too inquisitive and scientific-minded to genuinely believe in an afterlife.

Now the panic attacks seem to have subsided but she is still having these thoughts. It usually manifests itself as an hour long period of not being able to function and then suddenly gathering up the energy to study for hours. She doesn't feel comfortable talking to her parents about this anymore because they tell her she is crazy. She has told me herself that the feeling is so unbearable she wishes that she just didn't exist sometimes.

I am encouraging her to get as much physical activity as possible and showing my support, but I feel clueless what else I can do to make her feel better? I try to avoid the subject of death now because nothing I say makes her feel any better; she counters anything I say with "so what's the point, we are all going to disappear in the end." When she isn't having these thoughts, she is fairly normal, but they happen often enough to affect her day-to-day functioning.

Going to the doctor isn't a realistic option right now for various reasons.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is having a mental breakdown due to pressure and fear of death. She doesn't believe in an afterlife and doesn't feel comfortable talking to parents. I'm trying to support her but feel clueless on what else to do.

TITLE: I [17m] feel like I lose connection with my girlfriend [17f] during the week, but it flares up on the weekends. Lack of PDA problem?

POST: My girlfriend and I were friends for a very long time and in the last two months have become a thing. I really really like her and as far as I can tell, she is really into me, but we have a problem. 

She haaaaates PDA which is kind of a problem because we spend a lot of time together during the week in classes and other activities. To be fair, I don't really like PDA either but she hates it with a passion and refuses to let it happen. Consequently, I feel like we drift apart during the week. But wait there's more! On the weekends we will get together 2 or 3 times at either her place or mine and good god do we get together. There's so much passion when we're together on the weekends (alone) but then come Monday morning (in public), everything shuts down. Do you have any advice on what I can do to remain intimate during the week without PDA?

TL;DR: Girlfriend hates PDA, we drift apart during the week, but get super intimate on weekends. How can I keep the spark alive during the week without PDA?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think you're misunderstanding what PDA is. It's not just about physical touch, it's about showing affection and attention to each other in public. If your girlfriend is really into you, she should be okay with holding hands, giving hugs, or even just sitting close to each other in public. Maybe have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "It sounds like your girlfriend is struggling with intimacy anxiety. This is a common issue where people feel uncomfortable with physical affection in public, but crave it in private. You could try having a conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if she's willing to work on building intimacy in public. You could also try doing small, low-key PDA things like holding hands or giving gentle touches in public, and see if that helps her feel more comfortable."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on the PDA thing. Maybe just focus on having fun and being together during the week, and don't worry so much about physical affection. You can always find ways to be intimate and romantic in other ways, like through conversations, shared activities, or just being present for each other. Remember, relationships are about more than just physical touch."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're misunderstanding what intimacy is. Intimacy is not just about physical touch, it's about emotional connection and vulnerability. You can still be intimate with your girlfriend during the week by having deep conversations, sharing your feelings and desires, and being present for each other. Don't focus so much on the physical aspect, and instead focus on building a strong emotional connection with your girlfriend."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit community is generally supportive and understanding, with many users offering advice and suggestions on how to address the issue. Some users are more critical, pointing out that the OP is putting too much pressure on the PDA aspect and that intimacy is about more than just physical touch. Overall, the community is encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and to focus on building a strong emotional connection with her.

TITLE: Me [34 M] with my coworker [29 F] working together for 3 years, How do I get back to being just friendly coworkers?

POST: edit typo: Me [24 M]

We've been working together for about 3 years and I just started to feel really attached to her in the last 4 months. I never told her and I did the best I could not to hint at anything because she is already in a relationship. I accepted that we will never be together and I'm starting to feel less shitty when I'm not around her. 

The problem is. We still go to lunch together and see each other about once or twice a week. 

Any tips on how to forget about romantic feelings for her?

TL;DR: I have feelings for my coworker, but she's in a relationship and I don't want to ruin our working relationship. How do I stop having romantic feelings for her?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Honestly, it's probably best to just take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. If you're feeling this strongly about someone who's already in a relationship, it might be worth considering whether you're really ready for a serious relationship yourself. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and your own goals before trying to 'forget' about these feelings."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Yeah, because ignoring your feelings is always the best approach. Just pretend you don't have them and hope they magically disappear. Good luck with that."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to do the right thing. One thing that might help is to focus on the things you don't like about her as a person. Everyone has flaws, and focusing on those can help you see her in a more realistic light. Also, try to find other people at work who you can bond with and build relationships with. This might help you shift your focus away from her."
4. **CynicalChris**: "You're never going to 'forget' about your feelings, so why bother trying? Just accept that you have them and move on. If you're really concerned about ruining your working relationship, maybe just take a break from lunching together for a bit. You can always catch up with her at work or in a group setting if you need to."
5. **EmpatheticEve**: "I think it's great that you're considering your coworker's relationship and not wanting to ruin your working relationship. That takes a lot of maturity. One thing that might help is to focus on the things you have in common with your coworker, but not in a romantic way. For example, you could bond over a shared interest or hobby outside of work. This might help you see her as a friend and colleague rather than a romantic interest."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'm going to try to focus on the things we have in common outside of work, like our shared love of hiking. I also think I'm going to take some time to focus on myself and my own goals, like learning a new skill or taking on a new project at work. And yeah, maybe I'll take a break from lunching together for a bit. Thanks again for the advice!"

I proposed to my girlfriend this past March and we have done zero planning for it so far. I always wanted a big wedding until I came out and then the reason people get married completely changed for me. Now I just see it as I want to spend the rest of my life with her, not go into a lot of debt (neither of our parents are helping pay for it) and be stressed out, just so we can wait for the day to be over to move on with our lives. We're also saving for a down payment for a house. We were thinking of going to the courthouse and then throwing a party for everyone but that's  not good enough for her parents. because then aunts and uncles may feel excluded because we can't bring a million people to the courthouse and she's the only daughter so her dad wants to walk her down the aisle. I have three sisters, so my dad has been there done that. We were then thinking of a destination wedding but it would be really expensive for her parents to pay for her brothers to come (three younger brothers, still in college/hs) and her parents tried guilting her about her brothers not being there. Really, if we could go and get married today and move on from it and do nothing for it we would. But it seems unless we do wedding/reception everyone's going to be mad. 

Sorry for the long rant, but does anyone have advise on what to do? Has anyone done/seen the "screw you we got married at the courthouse now moving on from this" move? How has it worked out?

TL;DR: Frustrated with soon-to-be in-laws and wedding planning in general. Want to keep it simple and low-key, but they're pushing for a big wedding. Considering a courthouse wedding and party, but worried about excluding family members.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you and your fiancée are on the same page, but her parents are trying to dictate what you should do. Have you talked to your fiancée about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to have a conversation with her about what you both want and what you're willing to compromise on. It's also important to remember that it's your wedding, too, and you should have a say in how it's planned.

COMMENT 2:
I completely understand where you're coming from, OP. I got married at the courthouse and then had a small reception with our closest friends and family. It was perfect for us, and we didn't feel like we were missing out on anything. If you're worried about excluding family members, you could consider having a small ceremony and then a bigger celebration later on. For example, you could have a small ceremony with just your immediate family and then a bigger reception with all of your friends and family later on. This way, everyone gets to be included, but you don't have to feel like you're going into debt or stressing yourself out.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being really reasonable. It's your wedding, and you should do what makes you happy. If you and your fiancée want to keep it simple and low-key, that's perfectly fine. You don't have to feel like you need to go all out and have a big, expensive wedding just to make her parents happy. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize what's important to you. Remember, it's not about the wedding, it's about the marriage. Good luck, and I hope you find a solution that works for everyone.

COMMENT 4:
OP, I think you should consider having a small, intimate ceremony with just your closest family and friends. This way, you can still have a special moment with the people you care about, but you won't have to worry about the stress and expense of a big wedding. You could also consider having a small reception or celebration later on, like a brunch or dinner party. This way, everyone gets to be included, but you don't have to feel like you're going overboard. Just remember, it's your wedding, and you should do what makes you happy. Don't let anyone else dictate what you should do. Good luck!

TITLE: Afraid of my (29f) husband (27m) leaving me at his cousins wedding.

POST: Okay well, not *leaving* leaving. I'm not very good with crowds- they make me incredibly anxious to the point where I'll have a panic attack. Knowing my husband will, at least, be there with me usually helps me feel more comfortable around crowds. I'll know a fair bit of people there, so it's not like I won't have anyone to talk to. It's just the sheer amount of people that makes me freak out. 

My husband, however, doesn't understand this. He enjoys going from one set of people he likes to another, and usually in ways that would a) be impossible for me to follow him or b) make it very creepy if I were to try. He always tells me I should just try opening up and talking to people without him, but with the amount (even over 20 people) will start to make me nervous. 

I don't want to hinder him in any way, and I don't want to be a "ball and chain" to him. But I also feel like he's a little bit obligated to me as his wife to reassure me if I'm scared or anxious. What should I do? Is there a way of explaining this rationally, or am I just being unreasonable.

TL;DR: I'm anxious about going to my husband's cousin's wedding due to the large crowd, and my husband doesn't understand why I'm so scared. I don't want to hold him back, but I also want him to understand and support me.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide helpful advice and support. The OP (original poster) is struggling with anxiety and feeling like her husband doesn't understand her concerns. She's worried about being a "ball and chain" and not wanting to hold him back, but she also wants him to understand and support her.

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and offer helpful advice. Some common themes include:

* Acknowledge and validate the OP's feelings: Many commenters acknowledge that the OP's anxiety is real and valid, and that it's okay to feel scared or overwhelmed in certain situations.
* Encourage open communication: Several commenters suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with her husband about her feelings and concerns. This can help him understand her perspective and find ways to support her.
* Offer suggestions for coping with anxiety: Some commenters offer practical tips for managing anxiety in crowded situations, such as taking breaks, finding a quiet spot, or practicing deep breathing exercises.
* Remind the OP that she's not alone: Many commenters share their own experiences with anxiety and remind the OP that she's not alone in feeling this way. This can be a powerful reminder that it's okay to feel scared or overwhelmed, and that there are people who understand and care.

Overall, the comments on this post demonstrate a supportive and understanding community that is willing to listen and offer helpful advice. The OP's concerns are validated, and she is encouraged to communicate openly with her husband and find ways to manage her anxiety.

TITLE: (21/f) Husband (23/m) is honest and attracted to a coworker

POST: I have been in a relationship with my husband for 3 years now (married 1year) and we have a child. We fell in love in college but our relationship started with him choosing between me and another woman (we started as FWB) and after a bit of drama (nothing to dramatic really) he chose to be with me in a commited relationship. Fast foward to last year around october, we are enjoying sime alcoholic beverages and he lets it slip that in the very early days of our relationship he cheated on me...3 times. Of course I was shocked, hurt, angry, ect but we were married at this point and he was very ashamed so we talked about it and I decided to just try and handle it. I let him know that his trust card had been revoked and it would take a lot of work and time to get it back. well here we are now, he has been working at this place for 2 years and recently told me of a woman that works in the pffice upstairs for weeks her name kept coming up and I even gave him a book to give to her on a subject we are both interested in. Yesterday he confessed they were attracted to one another and that he felt bad because she flirted with him and he let her and he flirted back. He told he had been working up the courage to tell me for a couple weeks now and he tells me he will tell her today he can no longer be aroumd her or talk to her because of their attraction. Problem solved? 

I told him I was happy he told me and did not freak out on him because I want him to tell me these things in the future but my self esteem has always suffered and now it is even more crushed. I do not know what to think or feel or how to get over his past cheating and become a confident person. I feel lost.. Help?

TL;DR: Husband confessed to being attracted to a coworker and flirting with her, but he's going to tell her he can't be around her anymore. I'm happy he told me, but my self-esteem is crushed and I don't know how to get over his past cheating.

**Comments:**

* "OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's understandable that your self-esteem is crushed. It's like, you thought you had a solid foundation with your husband, and then you find out he's been attracted to someone else. It's like, what else have you been hiding from me? It's hard to trust someone who's been dishonest in the past. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your husband about how you're feeling. Let him know that his past actions have affected you and that you need him to work on rebuilding your trust. It's not going to be easy, but it's necessary for your relationship to move forward."
* "I think it's great that your husband is being honest with you about his feelings. It's not easy to admit when you're attracted to someone else, especially when you're in a committed relationship. However, it's also important to remember that his attraction to this coworker doesn't necessarily mean he's going to cheat on you again. It's up to you to decide whether or not you're willing to work through this and rebuild your relationship. If you're not comfortable with the idea of him being around this woman, then you need to have a conversation with him about it. But if you're willing to work through this and rebuild your relationship, then maybe this can be an opportunity for you both to grow and become stronger together."
* "OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's not easy to deal with the aftermath of infidelity, and it's even harder when it's something that's still going on. I would suggest taking some time for yourself to process your feelings and figure out what you want to do. It's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected, and if that's not happening, then it might be time to re-evaluate whether or not this relationship is healthy for you."

TITLE: Reddit, am I in trouble with the law?

POST: Hi! I was just DD'ing for my friends on a saturday night. I have expired plates as of may 30th and my insurance proof was at home.  A cop pulled me over to tell me that my plates were expired. I understand I should not have been driving but I have been late on getting them renewed (this is in canada by the way).

The officer took my license and asked me for my proof of insurance, I did not have it so I told him so. He gave me back my license and did not ticket me or anything, he merely told me to meet him at the station before his shift tomorrow and bring the insurance proof. Currently am I in trouble? 

The problem is the station is way across the city and I don't want to drive without my plates renewed. If I did not make the trip to show him my insurance proof tomorrow as he requested will he be able to ticket me or arrest me, he does have my name and license number and all the information on the license but the address on my license is not mine.. what I really want to know is that as of right now if I do not drive my car until I have my tags and insurance up to date and do not provide the documents the police officer asked me to provide will I be in trouble

TL;DR: Got pulled over for expired plates, didn't have insurance proof, officer took my license and asked me to bring proof to the station tomorrow. I'm worried about getting in trouble if I don't show up or don't have the proof. Will I be in trouble if I don't drive my car until I get my tags and insurance up to date and don't provide the documents the officer asked for?

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDIT**

* **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're not in trouble... yet. The officer gave you a chance to rectify the situation by bringing the proof to the station tomorrow. If you don't show up or don't have the proof, you're likely to get a ticket or even arrested. Just make sure to get your plates and insurance up to date ASAP and bring the proof to the station. It's better to be safe than sorry."
* **u/CanadianCynic**: "As a Canadian, I can tell you that it's not uncommon for police to give you a break if you're cooperative and honest. However, it's still important to follow up on the officer's request. If you don't show up or don't have the proof, you could face charges. Just make sure to get your affairs in order and bring the proof to the station. It's better to be safe than sorry."
* **u/Anonymous12345**: "I would suggest getting your plates and insurance up to date as soon as possible. If you don't, you could face fines and even have your license suspended. Just make sure to bring the proof to the station tomorrow and you should be okay. It's always better to be safe than sorry."
* **u/throwaway789012**: "I would recommend being honest with the officer and explaining your situation. If you're late on renewing your plates and insurance, it's understandable. Just make sure to get it taken care of ASAP and bring the proof to the station. It's better to be upfront and honest than to try to hide or avoid the situation."

**ADDITIONAL TIPS**

* Make sure to get your plates and insurance up to date as soon as possible to avoid any further issues.
* Be honest with the officer and explain your situation. It's better to be upfront and honest than to try to hide or avoid the situation.
* Bring the proof of insurance to the station tomorrow as requested by the officer.
* If you're unable to make it to the station, try to contact the officer or the police department to explain your situation and make alternative arrangements.

**CONCLUSION**

Based on the advice from Reddit, it seems that the OP is not in trouble... yet. However, it's still important to follow up on the officer's request and bring the proof of insurance to the station tomorrow. If the OP doesn't show up or doesn't have the proof, they could face charges. It's always better to be safe than sorry, so it's recommended that the OP gets their plates and insurance up to date as soon as possible and brings the proof to the station. Being honest and cooperative with the officer is also important, as it can help to avoid any further issues.

TITLE: Me [22M] cut contact from a girl [23F], she ended up texting me today.. need advice

POST: Cut contact with this girl because she still had a boyfriend.  I let her know that I saw us as more then friends and that when she becomes single for her to contact me and if not best of luck with everything.

three days later I get a text (legit 10 minutes ago).  
She said, "Just so you know we broke up."  (meaning her and her boyfriend.)  Now, I do not know how to respond, do I ask why, ask her how come, ask her when... 

Thing is we have been friends for a few months and I just could not do the friends thing anymore, so I decided cutting contact would be in MY best interests.  I can not ask her on any dates though because she is in Florida till october, and I just need advice on how to approach this situation.  Such as how to handle, stay in contact, be there for her, all the while keeping attraction up to what it was beforehand so that when she comes home our lives can intertwine again.

Thanks Reddit,

TL;DR: Cut contact with a girl because she had a boyfriend, she broke up with him, now I'm unsure how to respond and what to do next.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're already in a tricky situation. I'd say take a step back and don't respond to her text just yet. You need to think about what you want from this situation. Do you really want to get back together with her, or are you just trying to keep the door open? If it's the former, then you need to be prepared to put in the effort to rebuild your connection. If it's the latter, then you might want to just let things die down and move on. Take your time, and don't rush into anything."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just respond with a simple 'Congrats on the breakup' and see where it goes from there. You don't need to ask why or how come, just acknowledge the fact that she's single now. If she wants to talk or catch up, you can do that. If not, then you can just leave it at that. Remember, you cut contact with her for a reason, so don't feel obligated to jump back into things just because she's single now."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but hear me out. You cut contact with her because you didn't want to be friends with someone who was in a relationship. Now that she's single, you're suddenly interested in getting back together? That doesn't seem very genuine to me. I think you need to take a hard look at your motivations and ask yourself if you're just trying to get back with her because you feel guilty for cutting contact or because you really have feelings for her. If it's the former, then you need to own up to it and apologize for your behavior. If it's the latter, then you need to be prepared to put in the effort to rebuild your connection and prove to her that you're genuinely interested in her."
4. **RelationshipCoach**: "I think you're in a great position here. You've already established that you're not interested in being friends with her while she's in a relationship, so now you can use this as an opportunity to rekindle your connection on your own terms. Just respond to her text and see where it goes from there. If she's interested in talking or catching up, you can do that. If not, then you can just leave it at that. Remember, you're not obligated to get back together with her just because she's single now. You need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being in this situation."

TITLE: Is there a name for this phenomenon?

POST: I went to the bar last night for a friend's 21st. When I returned home, I went to sleep.

During my sleep I had a very intense dream about myself and several friends being held hostage in my own house by 14 armed men (probably because my thoughts were still on the fact that my house was burglarized yesterday morning). In this dream, I kept trying to escape the hostage-takers, but consistently failed. Then, when the dream got to the part where I was supposed to be shot, I jolted awake and realized I hadn't set my alarm before going to sleep.

Thinking I was very late for work, I panicked, jumped out of bed, and looked over at my alarm clock to see the time was 8:25am - 5 minutes before the time my alarm clock would have gone off had I remembered to set it.

TL;DR: Had a vivid dream about being held hostage, woke up 5 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off.

Is there a name for this phenomenon where your dream is so intense that you wake up before your alarm is supposed to go off, but you still feel like you're running late for something?

**Comments:**

* "This is called'sleep paralysis' and it's a common phenomenon where you're unable to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. It's often accompanied by vivid dreams or hallucinations."
* "I think you're just experiencing a normal dream. The fact that you woke up 5 minutes before your alarm is just a coincidence."
* "I've had this happen to me before and it's freaky. I think it's because your brain is trying to process the intense emotions from the dream and you wake up feeling like you're still in the dream state."
* "I've heard of people having 'false awakenings' where they wake up thinking it's morning, but then realize it's still night. Maybe this is similar?"
* "I think you're just experiencing a normal reaction to a stressful event (the burglary) and your brain is processing it through your dreams. It's not a specific phenomenon, just your brain trying to make sense of things."

TITLE: It's my Dad's Birthday, and I'm out of ideas!

POST: So going through my head trying to think of the things I have already bought him and what he needs, but now I'm stumped! He's a guitar teacher, so obviously he's very musical, he likes old movies and red wine. I have managed to be super creative in these categories for the past 15 of his birthdays but seeing as he has seen nearly every good pre 70s movie under the sun and he's bound to get really nice wines as gifts from his students, I just wanted to be a bit more creative this year. So, any ideas? :S

Cheers! :)

TL;DR: Dad's birthday is coming up and I'm out of ideas! He's a guitar teacher, likes old movies, and red wine. Help me be more creative this year!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Have you considered getting him a guitar-related gift? Maybe a new pedal, a set of strings, or a book on guitar theory? He might appreciate something that helps him improve his craft or expands his musical knowledge."
2. **u/MusicLover2000**: "How about a vinyl record player and a few of his favorite albums on vinyl? It's a unique gift that combines his love of music and old movies. You could also consider getting him a vintage-style poster or print of his favorite movie."
3. **u/WineLover3000**: "Red wine is a great interest of his, so why not take him on a wine tasting tour or a wine-making experience? Many local vineyards offer these types of events, and it's a unique way to spend the day together."
4. **u/CreativeGifts**: "I had a similar problem with my dad's birthday, and I ended up getting him a customized guitar pick necklace with his initials or a special message. It's a thoughtful and unique gift that shows you put effort into it."

TITLE: Reddit, I am a narcoleptic who has lost hope

POST: So, I never thought it might come to this.

I have narcolepsy. For the longest time, I felt that I had it under control. In school, my condition was misunderstood and I was ridiculed by my peers as well as my teachers. I overcame and found a nice job. I was laid off because of the recession and took up a job with a certain job with a certain game-related company. I tried my best to excel at my job, to the point where I became the Go-To-Guy for information on technical resolutions and policy matters. 

Today, I was demoted because my narcolepsy sometimes gets the better of me and I miss work. I cannot afford medical insurance nor the medicine to make it less of an issue ($500 for a month's supply). I was told that the ADA did not apply because attendance was a hard requirement for being a higher level agent. Our HR person told me that any job I get will have a requirement about attendance and that the ADA will never side with me. I am forced to assume an entry level position in a job I used to love. I feel as though my hard work will never pay off now, because my narcolepsy will also stop me from advancing and that ADA does not apply to me. 

I still feel like I'm being discriminated against but if what HR told me is true then I do believe that any career I take will be hampered by this condition, which cannot be cured. 

Please, tell me there are options. I feel as though I'm about to slip into a state of depression that I had left behind me so long ago. I don't want to be there. Please, tell me that there is hope.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons..

TL;DR: I have narcolepsy, was demoted due to attendance issues, and feel like my condition will hold me back from advancing in my career. I'm feeling hopeless and want to know if there are any options for me.

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're being unfairly treated and it's not your fault. Have you considered talking to a disability lawyer or an advocate? They might be able to help you understand your rights under the ADA and potentially get you the accommodations you need to succeed in your career."
2. **u/narcoleptic_ninja**: "I'm a fellow narcoleptic and I can totally relate to your struggles. I've had to deal with similar issues in my own career and it's frustrating and demoralizing. But I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people who understand what you're going through. Have you considered reaching out to organizations that support people with narcolepsy? They might be able to offer you resources and support to help you navigate your situation."
3. **u/Redditor123**: "I'm not an expert, but I think you might be misinformed about the ADA. While attendance is important, it's not the only factor that's considered when determining whether an employee is qualified for a job. Have you talked to a lawyer or an HR expert about your situation? They might be able to help you understand your rights and options."
4. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling hopeless. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. But I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor? They might be able to help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies to deal with your narcolepsy."
5. **u/throwawayaccount456**: "I'm not sure if this will help, but I wanted to share my own experience with narcolepsy. I was diagnosed when I was in college and it was really tough to adjust to. But I found that by taking medication and getting regular sleep, I was able to manage my symptoms and live a relatively normal life. I know it's not the same for everyone, but I wanted to offer you some hope and let you know that there are people who understand what you're going through."

TITLE: My [19F] boyfriend [20M] is failing out of college and I'm not. I have absolutely no idea what to do.

POST: Hi guys. I'm gonna keep this short for privacy reasons. Also throwaway. 

My boyfriend is a wonderful, sweet, caring person, but no matter how hard he works, he is just not good at school. We go to a competitive college (his dream school) and he's currently stuggling. If he has one more bad semester, he'll have to transfer to a smaller school and live at home for financial reasons. 

On the other hand, my grades are pretty good. I'm no scholar, but I do well. 

I have no idea how to be there for him through this without sounding like a jackass. I can't really empathize with him because I've never been through that. I can tell he's frustrated and disappointed, but he also doesn't want to talk about it. 

I love him so much and it kills me to see him like this. Anyone have any ideas about how to make him feel better? Should I let him work through it on his own? I'd really rather talk to him about it to show that I care about him and that I'll be there for him. 

How do I bring it up? How can I help him to not feel so bad about this? How can I let him know that if he has to transfer it'll be okay? I don't know how to bring it up without sounding like I think he's definitely going to fail out?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is struggling in college and I'm not. I love him and want to be there for him, but I don't know how to help him without sounding like a jackass. How can I bring it up and support him through this?

TITLE: Me (21/f) broke up with my bf (23/m) a week ago. Was it the right thing to do?

POST: note: throwaway because he's a reddit lurker.

me and my boyfriend would have been together for a year at the end of the month. We broke up after a conversation a week ago about our happiness came up (I asked if he was happy and what was happening to us after a weird patch). We mutually decided to end it and stay friends but I'm starting to regret it.

I'm worried that our unhappiness was merely due to my health problems and school stress getting me down and his sister is dying making him unhappy. I have felt worse than ever since and I just want to be with him. I told him I missed him last night and he told me he misses me too.

Also, a big part of me not thinking it was exactly the best idea to work it out was that next year i'm leaving for a month or two to travel then in 2.5 years when I finish studying I plan on leaving to find a new home somewhere in this big world. He says travelling doesn't interest him when it's my whole life plan to travel. Yet since meeting him my life plan wants to include him, what if he doesn't change his mind?

Do you guys think it's a good idea to talk to him about this all? I'm worried that if I do and he doesn't want to work this out the friendship we have will go to shit and I will be left COMPLETELY alone - note: i have very little friends as it is, none of which I can talk to about my health problems, he's my guy. I don't want to lose my friend.

TL;DR: broke up with bf a week ago due to unhappiness, now regretting it and worried about losing our friendship if I try to work it out.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123**: OP, I think you should talk to him about your concerns. It's better to be honest and clear about your feelings and plans than to assume he'll change his mind. If he doesn't want to work it out, then at least you'll know where you stand and can move forward. Don't worry about losing the friendship, you can still be friends even if it doesn't work out romantically.
2. **skeptical_sarah**: OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on him to change his mind. If he doesn't want to travel, that's okay. You can't force someone to change their plans just because you want to. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate your priorities and consider what you really want. Are you willing to compromise on your travel plans for him? Or are you willing to accept that he's not interested in traveling with you?
3. **relationship_ruth**: OP, I think you should take some time to reflect on why you broke up with him in the first place. Was it really just due to your health problems and school stress, or were there other issues? If you're still unhappy, maybe you need to address those underlying issues before trying to get back together. And if you do decide to talk to him, make sure you're coming from a place of honesty and vulnerability, not just trying to manipulate him into staying with you.
4. **heartbroken_hannah**: OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I went through a similar situation with my ex and it was super tough. But honestly, if you're still feeling unhappy and regretful, maybe it's not the right time to get back together. You need to focus on yourself and your own happiness before trying to fix things with him. Take some time to work on yourself and your own issues, and then maybe you'll be in a better place to make a decision about whether or not to get back together.
5. **wise_woman**: OP, I think you should take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You're 21 and he's 23, you're still young and have your whole lives ahead of you. Maybe this breakup is an opportunity for you to grow and learn more about yourself and what you want. Don't put too much pressure on him to change his mind, focus on becoming the best version of yourself and see where life takes you. And who knows, maybe you'll find someone even better suited for you in the future.

TITLE: I [20f] think I might have fucked up a friendship and I don't know what to do.

POST: So me and my best friend, "Jane" [21f] have been best friends for about a year, prior to us knowing each other she dated "Paul" [23m]. They broke up, but they're still friends. The three of us took a summer class together and we were pretty much inseparable. Get back to main campus and "Paul" dates this other girl and "Jane" is upset and doesn't talk to him for a month. Flash forward a year to present, the three of us are still very close, hangout most weekends. Now I kinda like Paul now, but I've been ignoring that because he dated Jane, so I know I shouldn't and I casually date a few other guys. Well this past weekend Jane goes home (we're college students). So friday night I'm texting Paul and we discover we're both about to watch the same movie. He asks if I wanna watch it with him, and I know I should have said no, but I didn't. So we watch the movie at his place and then go to a friend's and everythings fine. He drives me home and then tells me he's had a crush on me since my freshman year, when he was dating Jane. I told him I liked him too, but we couldn't do anything because of Jane and we had a good thing going and we should keep that way. He agrees and apologizes several times that night and even the next day.  What I'm wondering is do I tell Jane, I tell her everything, but I think telling her may hurt more than help, since I kind of suspect she has some residual feelings. Also I think I hurt him because I feel like hanging out with him on a Friday night lead him to do this. Right now we're still texting and I think we're just ignoring it, but he left early for his class today instead of hanging out with us. I feel so guilty and selfish and I dont know how to make this better.

TL;DR: I think I might have messed up a friendship by hanging out with my ex's friend, who I've developed feelings for, and I don't know what to do. I'm torn between telling my best friend everything, but I think it might hurt her more than help. I feel guilty and selfish and I don't know how to make this better.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, you should probably tell Jane. It's better to be upfront and honest with your best friend, even if it's uncomfortable. You can't keep this secret and expect it not to affect your friendship. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might be upset and take some time to process everything." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to be honest with Jane, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not take it well. You can't just keep this secret and expect everything to go back to normal. You need to have a real conversation with her and be honest about your feelings." (u/sarah123)
* "I think you should take some time to think about your feelings and what you want before you tell Jane. You need to be honest with yourself about why you're feeling guilty and what you're hoping to achieve by telling her. Are you trying to clear your conscience or are you trying to avoid the consequences of your actions? You need to be honest with yourself before you have this conversation with Jane." (u/johnnyboy)
* "I think you should tell Jane, but you should also be prepared for the possibility that she might not want to be friends with you anymore. You need to be honest with her and respect her feelings, even if they're different from yours. You can't force someone to be friends with you if they don't want to be." (u/throwaway6789)
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your friendship with Jane. If you're feeling guilty and selfish, it might be because you're not being honest with yourself about your feelings. You need to take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to do to get it. You can't keep living in limbo and expecting everything to go back to normal." (u/samantha123)

---

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are divided on whether the OP should tell Jane about her feelings for Paul. Some commenters believe that honesty is the best policy and that the OP should tell Jane everything, while others think that the OP should take some time to think about her feelings and what she wants before having this conversation with Jane. Some commenters also suggest that the OP should be prepared for the possibility that Jane might not take it well and that the friendship might not survive this revelation. Overall, the comments on this post highlight the complexity of the situation and the importance of being honest and respectful in relationships.

TITLE: TIFU by not wanting to be rude to a hairdresser

POST: This happened about an hour ago. I went to get a haircut as my hair was getting too long, I usually have it cut by the same girl but today I got booked in last minute and had someone new. She sat me down and asked what I wanted and since I've only really had one hairdresser for the past two years I've gotten used to not saying what I want. So I say "I don't know", but she still fires questions at me and I reply as best I can saying "Not to short" and "Yes she does use clippers" (referring to the other hair dresser). Eventually she gets started, and this is where I fuck up. She takes number 4 clippers and takes a chunk of hair out of left side of my head, I only expected her to trim around the edges but she went all in, I should have stopped her but I just don't have it in me to be rude. So I try to stay calm and let her finnish, after all, she is a professional. She completes the final touches... And it looks terrible. I have a long face, if that makes sense, and the way she cut it makes it look even longer. Now I'm sitting inside not wanting to venture outside for at least 3 weeks, but I have school in 2 days. Do you think I'm overreaching a bit?

TL;DR: I got a haircut and the hairdresser cut too much hair off, I didn't want to be rude so I let her finish, now I'm mortified and don't want to leave the house.

The post also sparks a discussion about communication and boundaries in professional settings.

Overall, this post is a great example of the TIFU subreddit's focus on sharing embarrassing and relatable stories, and the community's supportive and humorous response to them.

TITLE: I [20F] think I want to end my relationship with my Father [46 M]

POST: So growing up I have always had a good relationship with both my parents. They were great parents and there's nothing I can honestly complain about with how they raised me. I was also really close to my Dad when growing up. Please believe me when I say he wasn't always a jerk. He was a good Dad and husband. He taught me a lot and helped me to become the independent person I am today. 

Unfortunately, he is not that person anymore. Over the last two years he has just kind of been gone. He would not come home. for days. If he did come home he was always really drunk. Later I found out he was also under the influence of some drugs. He also cheated on my mom with a girl around my age. 

So I watched my Dad go from a happy-go-lucky guy to a sad, pathetic drunk. In May this all came to a head. It was a really tough time for my family. My Dad eventually told my Mom and I he was going to stop and he was going to get help. So, we tried to rebuild the family. 

I actually got to see my Dad happy again. He stopped drinking and doing drugs. He seemed to be making progress and I was getting ready to forgive him

Well, long story short, he was caught cheating again and doing the previously mentioned things. I just can't handle it. Why did he not just leave back in May? It could of been done with months ago. I just feel even more hurt now. 

I know he does not want me to cut him out of my life, but I don't know what else to do. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? Also, would it be better to just cut him out of my life completely? 

Sorry for the rambling. This is all pretty fresh still.

TL;DR: My Dad has been a drunk and cheater for the past two years. He promised to get help and seemed to be making progress, but got caught cheating again. I'm at a loss and don't know what to do.

TITLE: My friend's [27M] girlfriend has a serious issue with me [27F] for no reason. He won't address it.

POST: I've been very good friends with my friend, Chris, for 4 years. We met through my ex and we've always had a completely platonic friendship (I was also good friends with his ex-wife at the time). He's been in a relationship with his current girlfriend (Angela) for about a year and a half. For numerous reasons, I've only met her once about a year ago and she was very sweet and friendly. Since then we haven't seen each other because she travels for work and that's when Chris and I catch up; additionally, she has her own social life and on days when she wants to be alone with her friends, he and I will grab dinner. She never has a problem with that as far as I know.

Anyway, I went out with Chris, Angela, and another couple on Saturday and when we were exchanging hello's she just glared at me. No response. I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. 

The next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all. I was shocked and hurt, and he defended his decision not to ask because he has bigger priorities now (they're having problems-- no wonder). This is out of character for him.

I've never done anything to warrant this type of treatment and I'm concerned because we'll be at the same event in a couple of weeks hosted by his brother. I feel like I deserve an explanation, or at the very least, someone should raise the issue with her.

How do I discuss this again with Chris? :(

TL;DR: My friend's girlfriend has been ignoring me for no apparent reason, and he won't address it. I'm hurt and concerned about our friendship and the upcoming event. How do I bring it up with him again?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like Angela has some issues with you and Chris isn't addressing it because he's prioritizing his relationship with her. You should have a calm and respectful conversation with Chris about how you're feeling. Try to avoid blaming or accusing him, and focus on your own emotions and concerns."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's possible that Angela has some unresolved issues with you from the past, or maybe she's just not comfortable with the dynamic between you and Chris. You should try to have an open and honest conversation with Chris about how you're feeling, and see if you can get some insight into what's going on. It's also possible that Chris is just not prioritizing your friendship right now, and that's okay. You deserve to have your feelings heard and respected, though."
3. **u/justanotheruser**: "I think you should try to talk to Chris about this, but also be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to address the issue. If that's the case, you might need to re-evaluate the friendship and decide if it's worth continuing. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and if Chris's girlfriend is not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to distance yourself from the situation."
4. **u/anonymous123**: "I think you should try to talk to Chris about this, but also be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to address the issue. If that's the case, you might need to re-evaluate the friendship and decide if it's worth continuing. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and if Chris's girlfriend is not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to distance yourself from the situation."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post offer a range of advice and perspectives on how to approach the situation. Some suggest having a calm and respectful conversation with Chris, while others recommend being prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to address the issue. The common thread is that the OP deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, and that they should prioritize their own emotional well-being in this situation. Ultimately, the decision of how to proceed will depend on the OP's individual circumstances and what they feel is best for their friendship.

TITLE: I [18 F] started seeing someone [24 M] for the past couple months, should I be concerned by the age gap?

POST: What do you make of this age difference?  In the beginning I wasn't bothered by it, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe there is something wrong with this relationship. 

We get along great and share a lot of the same interests.  He has a full time job and I just started uni.  I'm conflicted because I like him and feel that we have great chemistry, but we are in two very different places in our lives and I don't want to be taken advantage of.  He's never made me feel like the lesser individual in the relationship but I'd appreciate any input on the situation so that I can proceed in a way that is healthy for us both.

TITLE: [19M] There's this girl [19F] I like. Does she likes me back?

POST: We go to german lessons together, I met her a week ago. Our 'german group' is really small (only 6 people) and we're actually the only people talking to each other. 

She is very kind and friendly towards me and tries to initiate chat. She laughs hysterically(!) at some of my jokes (she doesn't laugh at ALL of them). She says "hello" in a very seductive way, yeah I know that's a stupid thing to say but I've never been greeted by a girl this way.

Note that this girl is BEAUTIFUL. And I mean perfect 10/10 and probably gets any guy she wants. I gotta say I'm an average looking guy, slightly above average in best case. I'm really not that funny guy, I don't lack social skills but I'm a bit weird, in a positive way. 

In normal circumstances, I'd say she's into me. But I really have nothing to show her what other guys don't already have! 

Is she maybe pranking me?

Or does she genuinely likes me?

TL;DR: I like this girl, she's beautiful, friendly, laughs at my jokes. Is she into me or just being nice?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're overthinking this. She's being friendly and kind because she's a nice person, not because she's into you. Don't read too much into it."
2. **GermanGuru**: "I'm a German teacher and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for students to form close bonds in small groups. She might be genuinely interested in getting to know you better, but it's not necessarily romantic."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I think you're selling yourself short. You're not 'average looking' and you're 'weird' in a positive way? That's awesome! Confidence is attractive, and if she's laughing at your jokes, it's because she enjoys your company. Don't worry about what other guys have or don't have. Just be yourself and see where things go."
4. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's unlikely that a girl like her is genuinely interested in you. She might be being nice because she's a good person, but it's also possible she's just being polite. Don't get your hopes up too high, okay?"

**Original poster's response:** "Thanks for the comments, guys! I think I'll just take your advice and not overthink it. I'll just keep being myself and see where things go. And yeah, I guess I was being a bit too optimistic. Thanks for the reality check!"

TITLE: I need a gift idea for my daughter's first day of kindergarten. Help me, Reddit.

POST: My little girl was born 7 1/2 weeks early (which was also six weeks past the age cutoff for our school district).

After two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).
Now, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.

We've been terrified for a while of her having to wait an entire year for her to start kindergarten because she'd probably end up a huge discipline problem and start-off her entire school experience on a terrible foot.

After months of looking, we finally found a private school willing to bend the rules for her and that we can afford.  Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.

So, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.

But, I'm drawing a blank.  I've thought about jewelry, but what can I find that would withstand a kid that young and be something she'd want to keep as she gets older?

Help me, reddit!  You're my only hope.

TL;DR: My 4 1/2 year old daughter is starting kindergarten early due to her accelerated development. I want to give her a special gift on her first day, but I'm struggling to find something that's both durable and meaningful. Help!

COMMENT 1:
Congrats on finding a school that's willing to accommodate your daughter's needs! That's amazing.

As for a gift, I think something personalized would be great. You could get her a customized book with her name and a special message inside. There are plenty of websites that offer this service.

Alternatively, you could get her a personalized backpack or lunchbox with her name and initials. This would be a practical gift that she could use for years to come.

If you want something a bit more sentimental, you could get her a customized picture frame with a special photo of the two of you. This would be a great way to capture a moment in time and give her a reminder of how much you love her.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 2:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized water bottle or a special kind of pencil case that she can use in school.

Another idea is to create a special "first day of kindergarten" journal or scrapbook for her. You could include pictures and mementos from her first day, as well as notes and messages from you and other family members.

This would be a great way to capture her first day of school and create a special keepsake that she can treasure for years to come.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 3:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized keychain or a special kind of charm that she can wear on her backpack or lunchbox.

Another idea is to create a special "kindergarten survival kit" for her. You could include items like a favorite snack, a special blanket or stuffed animal, and a note with words of encouragement.

This would be a great way to help her feel more comfortable and confident on her first day of school.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 4:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized bookmark or a special kind of book light that she can use when she's reading.

Another idea is to create a special "reading log" for her. You could include a list of books she's read, as well as a place for her to write her thoughts and feelings about each book.

This would be a great way to encourage her love of reading and help her develop a habit of tracking her progress.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 5:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized pencil case or a special kind of eraser that she can use in school.

Another idea is to create a special "art supply kit" for her. You could include items like crayons, markers, and paint, as well as a special kind of paper or canvas that she can use to create her own art.

This would be a great way to encourage her creativity and help her develop a love of art.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 6:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized water bottle or a special kind of lunchbox that she can use in school.

Another idea is to create a special "snack pack" for her. You could include items like goldfish crackers, fruit snacks, and a special kind of juice box that she can enjoy during her lunch break.

This would be a great way to help her feel more comfortable and confident on her first day of school.

I hope these ideas help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

COMMENT 7:
I think a customized item is a great idea! You could also consider a customized backpack or a special kind of lunchbox that she can use in school.

TITLE: Reddit, i need your help with a girl.... its complicated.

POST: alright so some background info - im 19 and just finished school, i live in australia and am going to college in a couple months in Canberra (australias capital). About 4 weeks back i went to Europe with my family - we went all over Europe on holiday (zermatt, then chamonee, then paris then...

then we got to saint brieuc. My sister went on French exchange there and had a lovely family with three sisters, (one 19 one 21 and one 24) my sister is now 23. Our plan was to stay there for 1 week (in their house because they insisted) and then it happened.I met the 19 year old and... i fell for her. the second i saw her i knew... Reddit, ive had girlfriends before but ive never met a girl who made me stutter like this, or a girl who made me so happy like she does and did..
The cutest thing about it was that we both had done 3 yrs of french and 3 yrs of english each, so our talking was very funny ^.^ and there was often a dictionary close by... for the longer sentences we used translators on iphone.

now to the question : 
i have dreamt of her every day since i got back from france, and every time i do i find myself smiling.

Reddit... what do i do?
im not happy here, i cant find purpose in my life without her and even if she doesnt feel the same way just to be near her would be enough for me.. just to be her friend and see her smile...
but i dont have the money and my parents refuse to send me on any elaborate holidays... i also wouldnt be able to get along in france without knowing the language..

im lost reddit... and ive come to you.

TL;DR: OP fell in love with a 19-year-old French girl during a family holiday in France. He's struggling to come to terms with his feelings and is seeking advice on what to do.

TITLE: Long distance girlfriend [24 F] of six months is moving again but not back where I [30 M] am.

POST: I got into a long-distance relationship about six months ago, right before my girlfriend made a temporary move. We were just getting to know each other at first, but things kept snowballing as we got to know each other and we got more emotionally involved. She has been back once since then and things kept building to the point that we were talking about life plans when she returned.

The problem is that she's now not going to return for several years.

The plan was that she would be back here for graduate school, but it turns out that she got an offer she can't turn down somewhere else. It's going to be a multi-year commitment of lots of work, and there's no guarantee she will ever be back here, even though it's currently part of her long-term plan.

So the options now are to give up or go with her. Neither really feels like the right choice. I encouraged her to go to the school because the offer was too good to pass up, and I'm not about to ask her to take out substantially larger amounts of debt so we can be together. But with her going to school, she will be locked in for several years and maybe longer once she starts her career. I can travel to see her more often than we have so far, but ultimately, I would have to move at some point. 

As for me, I'm further in my career, and it's unfortunately not one where good opportunities come up very often. I also have friends, connections and a current job where I am and wouldn't have chosen the city she's moving to for myself if I were to move. I worry that if I go, she will be all I have in this new place.

We both want to be with each other and have said that we thought this could be a lifelong relationship. We are both heartbroken at the thought of giving up, but staying together doesn't seem to be an option either.

Any words of wisdom from someone who has made long-distance work? Or from someone who has moved solely for another person? I'm heartbroken and distraught all at the same time.

TL;DR: Long distance girlfriend of six months is moving again, but not back where I am. We both want to be together, but the distance and uncertainty of her future plans are making it hard to decide what to do.

---

This post is a heart-wrenching account of a long-distance relationship that is facing a significant challenge. The couple has been together for six months, and the girlfriend has just received an offer that will keep her away for several years. The boyfriend is torn between giving up on the relationship and going with her, but he is also concerned about the impact on his own life and career.

The post is seeking advice from people who have experience with long-distance relationships or have made significant sacrifices for love. The author is looking for words of wisdom to help him make a decision that will allow him to maintain his relationship while also considering his own well-being.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* Advice on how to maintain a long-distance relationship, such as setting regular communication schedules, making time for visits, and finding ways to stay connected despite the distance.
* Encouragement to take a leap of faith and move to be with the girlfriend, even if it means giving up some comforts and familiarity.
* Suggestions for how to navigate the uncertainty of the girlfriend's future plans and find ways to stay connected while she is away.
* Personal stories of people who have made similar sacrifices for love and how it has worked out for them.

Overall, this post is a poignant reminder of the challenges and sacrifices that come with long-distance relationships, and the importance of communication, trust, and compromise in making them work.

TITLE: Me (22/F) and my boyfriend (31/m) of 2 years. Feeling rejected.

POST: Hey r/relationships, I need your advice. I'm posting this on mobile so I'm sorry in advance for any formatting errors! 

I met my boyfriend, L, 2 years ago. We hit it off instantly and the chemistry between us was insane. I know the age difference seems a little strange, but we've made it work with very little struggle until now.

We moved in together in August after dating for about 1.5 years. When we first started dating, we were having sex every time we saw each other. That was 5-7 times a week. Naturally as our relationship matured, the sex slowed down a little bit. For the past year and a half, we have sex maybe twice a month, and I have to initiate it every time. Since we've lived together (4 months) he has initiated once. Now I'm not naive, and I know he watches porn and masturbates daily. I've come across the porn on his phone. I've been trying to tell myself that I'm perfectly ok with this and that it doesn't hurt me at all. But I can't lie to myself anymore. I am hurt. He chooses porn over me daily. I've tried to talk to him before about how the fact that he never initiates sex with me hurts my feelings and makes me feel unwanted, and those conversations lead to him giving me a thousand excuses and initiating once the next day and everything goes back to the way it was for a few months. I've never brought up the porn because I'm really scared he will choose it over me... He really is the love of my life and other than this, our relationship is nearly perfect. He is a very caring man and I know he is who I want to spend the rest of my life with. R/relationships, how do I fix our sex life? I want to have sex more often, and I want him to initiate it more. I know I need to have a conversation with him, but I don't know where to begin.

TL;DR: 22F, 2-year relationship with 31M. Sex life has slowed down, and I initiate every time. He watches porn daily, and I feel rejected. I want to fix our sex life, but I'm scared to bring it up. Help!

**Comment 1:**
Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's understandable that you're hurt and frustrated. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work on your relationship. Here's a suggestion: instead of focusing on the frequency of sex, try to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you feel when he chooses porn over you. Use "I" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing language. For example, "Hey, I feel really hurt and rejected when I see you watching porn and not initiating sex with me. It makes me feel like I'm not desirable to you." This might help him understand your perspective and feel more inclined to make changes. Remember, communication is key in any relationship!

**Comment 2:**
OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for your partner to prioritize porn over you. I think it's great that you're recognizing your feelings and wanting to work on your relationship. Here's a suggestion: try to have a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and boundaries. Let him know that you feel hurt and rejected when he chooses porn over you, and that you'd like to have more intimate moments together. You can also set boundaries around what you're comfortable with and what you're not. For example, you could say, "Hey, I feel really uncomfortable when you watch porn in our home. Can we find other ways to relax together?" Remember, you deserve to feel respected and valued in your relationship!

TITLE: My ex [20 F] of 3 years, asks me [20 M] to drive 500kms and get them.

POST: My ex and I have been ex's for about 5 months. She broke the relationship off, she said her feelings for me had faded. I was truly heartbroken and I am still progressing this, but feel less for her every day now days. Within this time we've talked a little, mostly basic questions like how eachother is doing.

I figured out a couple of days ago that I still have a couple of things at her place, a grillpan, and a couple of other things. Now we live about 500 kms apart, so get it is really not that easy. So I messaged her about it. It goes a day or two, she messages back that she can't find a box that big for the pan to fit in. I replyed that she can buy a large box, she claims she does not know where to buy one big enough.

In the next message she askes "Stupid question, but you wouldn't be able to come here and pick them up? :)".

As much as I still have still feelings for her, but certainly not as much as before. I wonder what she really wants. I don't want to be rude either, we handled this breakup like two adults. I don't know if I want to see her, as she was my first love of course she will be special to me. What can I reply to this?

If a longer version is needed, I think I can provide one.

TL;DR: Ex asks me to drive 500kms to pick up a few things from her place. I'm unsure what she really wants and if I should go.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's trying to get you to come to her place for some reason. Maybe she's not over you as much as she thought she was. You don't have to go, but if you do, make sure you're prepared for the possibility that she might try to rekindle things."
* "I think you should be cautious here. She's asking you to make a big effort to get these things, and it's not like they're super valuable or anything. You could just offer to send them to her or something. If she's really that bothered about getting them, she could try to find a way to get them herself."
* "I think you should be honest with her. Tell her that you're not comfortable making a 500km trip just to pick up a few things. You can say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not really comfortable making that long of a trip just for a few items. Maybe we can figure out another way to get them to you?'"
* "I think you should go. It's not like it's a huge ask, and it's not like you're going to be stuck there for hours or anything. It's just a quick trip to pick up some stuff. If you're really unsure, you could always ask her if she's willing to meet you halfway or something."
* "I think you should be careful about getting too caught up in this. You're still processing your feelings for her, and you don't want to get stuck in a situation where you're trying to prove something to her or trying to get back together. Just be honest with her and tell her you're not comfortable making the trip. You can always offer to send the items to her or something."
* "I think you should go, but only if you're comfortable with it. If you're not, then don't. It's not worth it. You deserve to be happy, and if being around her is going to make you unhappy, then it's not worth it. You can always try to send the items to her or something."

TITLE: Teachers vs. Unions - What do you think?

POST: Here are some thoughts, and feel free to chime in - this is a discussion not a debate.  I believe teachers should be well paid, based on merit.  They should have to take examinations and re-up their credentials on a regular basis.  They are, after all, the most important people in the world.

Here's the dilemma.  Teacher Unions are the scummiest, worst organizations in the world.  Yes, they protect teachers (some of the time) but put most of their effort in making money from (underpaid) teachers in order to perpetuate the myth teachers will die without a union to back them.

Sadly, in the US, teachers would likely get ass-raped by the powers that be if they didn't have a union at all.  So it's kind of a catch-22.

What do you folks think?

TL;DR: Teachers should be well paid, based on merit, but teacher unions are corrupt and prioritize making money over protecting teachers.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456789**: I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of unions. Unions aren't just about making money, they're about protecting workers' rights and advocating for better working conditions. Without unions, teachers would be at the mercy of administrators and politicians who would exploit them for their own gain.
2. **Teacher123**: As a teacher, I can attest that unions are not just about making money. They're about having a collective voice and advocating for our students and our profession. Without unions, we'd be forced to work long hours for little pay and no benefits.
3. **NotMyPresident**: I think you're being unfair to teacher unions. They're not perfect, but they're a necessary evil. Without them, teachers would be exploited and underpaid. And let's be real, the alternative is a bunch of corporate-backed charter schools that prioritize profits over people.
4. **SkepticalSally**: I agree that teacher unions can be corrupt, but that's not a reason to get rid of them entirely. Instead, we should be working to reform them and make them more transparent and accountable. And let's not forget that teachers are already underpaid and overworked, so we need to prioritize their well-being and support their unions.
5. **ConcernedCitizen**: I think we need to focus on the root causes of the problem, rather than just blaming the unions. We need to address the systemic issues that lead to underfunding and overcrowding in our schools, and we need to prioritize teacher training and support. And let's not forget that teachers are not just employees, they're also parents and community members who deserve respect and support.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my crush [23 F] 1 month, I like my big sister of the fraternity I'm in?

POST: I am in a co-ed fraternity and I got paired up with this girl I didn't know was going to be so amazing. I could talk to her and carry a conversation without having any trouble at all. I feel like she is so easy to talk to about things that I have trouble telling my best girlfriend. She makes me smile, laugh, and just makes me happy when I'm around her. However, she's my fraternity big sister so that could potentially be weird. I know she doesn't like dating within the fraternity but will do it if the right guy comes along. Any advice would be helpful. How can I approach this situation?

TL;DR: I'm in a co-ed fraternity and I have a crush on my big sister. She's amazing and we have great conversations, but I know she doesn't like dating within the fraternity. Should I approach her or is it too weird?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's not weird at all. You're just trying to get to know her as a person, not as your big sister. Just be respectful and genuine in your approach and see where it goes."
* "I would say it's a bit weird, but not because of the fraternity thing. It's because you're in a position of authority over her as her big brother. Just make sure you're not taking advantage of that and being respectful of her boundaries."
* "I think it's a great opportunity to get to know her better! Just be open and honest about your feelings and see how she feels. Remember, it's okay if it doesn't work out, but it's worth a shot."
* "I would suggest talking to her about it and seeing how she feels. If she's not interested, then you can just go back to being friends and big brother/little sister. But if she is interested, then you can start dating and see where it goes."
* "I think it's a bit weird, but not because of the fraternity thing. It's because you're in a position of authority over her as her big brother. Just make sure you're not taking advantage of that and being respectful of her boundaries." (same comment as above)

This post and its comments demonstrate the complexity of relationships within a fraternity setting. The OP is torn between his feelings for his big sister and the potential awkwardness of dating someone in a position of authority over him. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from those who think it's not a big deal to those who are more cautious. Ultimately, the OP will need to consider his own feelings and boundaries, as well as those of his big sister, before making a move.

TITLE: Donating land out of Revenge. How will this help my tax returns?

POST: This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. 

A little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  

We discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? 

I want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)

TL;DR: Donating land to a non-profit to use as a tax deduction, but how will this affect my tax returns? Is this a good idea? 

---

This post is a great example of how Reddit's r/personalfinance community can provide valuable insights and advice on complex financial topics. The OP (original poster) is seeking guidance on how to donate land to a non-profit organization and use it as a tax deduction, while also addressing the issue of the neighbors removing the for sale signs.

The community responds with a mix of advice and questions, including:

* "Have you considered working with a tax professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation?"
* "It's great that you're considering donating the land to a non-profit, but have you thought about the potential impact on your property taxes?"
* "You may want to consider donating the land to a local land trust or conservation organization, which could help preserve the natural habitat and provide a tax deduction."
* "It's also worth noting that the IRS has specific rules and guidelines for charitable donations, so be sure to follow those guidelines carefully."

The OP also receives some humorous responses, including:

* "I'm no expert, but I think you might be able to use the land as a tax deduction, but only if you're willing to give up your right to build a house on it."
* "I'm not sure if this is the best idea, but I do know that donating land to a non-profit can be a great way to reduce your taxable income."

Overall, the r/personalfinance community provides a wealth of information and advice on the topic, and the OP is able to get a better understanding of how to move forward with their plan.

TITLE: I [19 F] chose to date my boyfriend [21 M] over dating my best friend [19 M] and now I'm afraid I made a mistake.

POST: I've had my best friend [19 M] friendzoned for 4 years. We met when I was dating my ex, so I never really saw him as anything more than a friend. He's been there for me for everything. He's basically been in love with me since the moment we met. He would do anything for me if it meant that I would be happy. I never thought that I would have feelings for him like he has for me. That is until a couple months ago.

 I developed feelings for him, while also developing feelings for my current boyfriend, [21 M]. Everyone told me to give my best friend a chance, but I was afraid of losing our friendship in the process, and I had stronger feelings towards my boyfriend. So I told my boyfriend that I would date him, and now my best friend will barely talk to me and wants to kick my boyfriends ass. Also all my friends are mad at me for the decision I made. I regret not giving him a chance, but I feel like if we were to have dated, I should have feelings for only him, and not anyone else. My boyfriend said he would fight my best friend if that's what he really wants, but I don't want them fighting over me. I'm afraid I lost my best friend and made a mistake in not choosing him, now I don't know what to do. Any advice Reddit?

TL;DR: I chose to date my boyfriend over my best friend, who has been in love with me for years, and now I'm afraid I made a mistake. My best friend is mad at me, my friends are mad at me, and I'm torn between my feelings for both of them. Help!

**Reddit's Response:**

* **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, you made a choice and now you have to live with it. You can't go back in time and change it. What you can do is try to make amends with your best friend and apologize for hurting him. If he's willing to forgive you, then you can try to rebuild your friendship. If not, then you'll have to accept that you lost a friend. As for your boyfriend, if he's willing to fight your best friend over you, then that's a red flag. You deserve someone who respects your relationships and doesn't want to fight over you."
* **u/sadpanda123**: "I think you're being unfair to your best friend. He's been in love with you for years and you're just now realizing you have feelings for him? That's not fair to him. You should have given him a chance when you had the chance. Now you're stuck with a boyfriend who's willing to fight your best friend over you, and you're torn between your feelings for both of them. I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities."
* **u/relationshipadvice**: "It sounds like you're feeling guilty and regretful about your decision. That's normal. But you need to remember that you made a choice based on your feelings at the time. You can't change the past, but you can try to move forward. If you're still having feelings for your best friend, then maybe you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you feel. If you're not ready to commit to him, then maybe you should just focus on your current relationship and try to make it work. But don't keep stringing him along or leading him on. That's not fair to him."
* **u/throwaway321**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You made a choice and now you have to live with it. You can't change the past, but you can try to make the best of it. If you're still having feelings for your best friend, then maybe you should try to talk to him and see if there's a way to make things work between you two. But if you're not ready to commit to him, then maybe you should just focus on your current relationship and try to make it work. Don't beat yourself up over it, just move forward and try to make the best of it."

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community is divided on the issue, with some users advising the OP to apologize to her best friend and try to rebuild their friendship, while others think she should focus on her current relationship and try to make it work. Some users also point out that she should have given her best friend a chance when she had the chance, and that she's being unfair to him by leading him on. Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what she wants and what's best for her, and try to move forward in a positive way.

TITLE: What's the male equivalent of flowers?

POST: Basically, I want to do something sweet and romantic for my boyfriend. Here's the long version: 

According to the weather forecasts, it's going to be a beautiful day today. My boyfriend and I decided to go to a local park we've been meaning to visit for months - the weather just hasn't been nice enough until today. The park's right near a relatively swanky area, and since today's payday and we haven't had a "date night" in a while, we decided to get a pseudofancy dinner afterwards. I'm really looking forward to it. Things haven't always been easy or simple in our relationship, but I think we have a really good foundation and we're really making sure we put time in with each other to maintain it.   

With that in mind, I'd really like to do something special and sweet for him. He's more of a romantic type than I am, so I think he would appreciate it. However, I'm not sure what to do - if the situation were reversed, and I was a boy wanting to surprise a girl, I'd definitely get flowers. But I don't think that'll have the same effect...call me crazy if I'm wrong :) So I was wondering if Reddit could do me a favor and weigh in on what they think the equivalent of flowers are, for a guy. Suggetions are welcome! It's not a special event like an anniversary or anything, just a night out. I'd really love to hear what you have to say on this: I want to surprise him AND get him something (do something for him) he'll really appreciate.   

I know some people are going to respond to this with "sex" or "bj," but if you can help it, please refrain. He's already going to get laid tonight, and probably getting blown for foreplay. I want to do something _besides_ that. (Or on top of that, heh.) Besides, I don't think sex should be a special-occasion-I-love-you surprise. That implies some shitty things about your love life, imo.    

Thanks for reading...please help me out!

TL;DR: I want to do something sweet and romantic for my boyfriend, but I don't know what the male equivalent of flowers is. Help me out, Reddit!

TITLE: What is the single funniest moment you've ever experienced?

POST: I have one that stands out from all of the rest.
I was 13; Me and 2 friends were at a minor league baseball game in the mediocre city of Columbia, SC. It was a diabetes benefit game that had rides and games set up out in an open area by left field, which included a bouncey-house thing and an enormous inflatable water slide contraption. At around half time, me and my dickhead friends decided it would be hilarious if we unplugged the bouncey-house while nobody was looking.  Nobody was remotely near it so we figured it would just a quick laugh and nothing dangerous.  My friend J pulled the plug out from a power strip on the ground, and we waited for about 5 minutes for something to happen, but nothing did.  We were just turning to get back to our seats when literally hundreds of parents started screaming and running to the giant waterslide behind us.  It had tipped over on its side and about 30 small children were clinging to the side as it deflated on top of them.  Terrified, we fled the stadium and sat outside.  A firetruck and 2 police cars showed up, so we ran and hid in the woods behind the parking lot.  An hour later, we returned to the stadium and learned that everyone was okay.  I laughed for so long and so hard that I was sore for days after.

TL;DR: Unplugged a bouncey-house at a minor league baseball game, causing a giant inflatable water slide to tip over and trap 30 small children.  We fled, hid in the woods, and laughed for days.

COMMENTS:

* "That's amazing. I'm dying over here. 'We fled, hid in the woods, and laughed for days' is the best part."
* "I'm impressed you guys didn't get arrested. That's some next-level mischief."

* "I'm dying over here. 'We were just turning to get back to our seats when literally hundreds of parents started screaming and running to the giant waterslide behind us' is the funniest thing I've ever read."
* "I hope you guys got in trouble for that. You should have gotten in trouble for that."
* "I'm impressed you guys didn't get trampled by the parents. That's some crazy stuff."
* "I love how you guys just sat outside for an hour, waiting for the chaos to die down. You guys are the best."
* "I'm dying over here. 'An hour later, we returned to the stadium and learned that everyone was okay' is the best part. You guys are the best."

TITLE: What can you do if your company you paid for your domain name let it lapse just one month after you paid for it?

POST: A bit of back story.  I have been using this company to register my domain and host my site for years.  Its a little site, nothing special, just my home business.  I am really attached to my domain name, so when I returned to school I kept up payments but didn't keep much of a website (just the basic info on some pages, more brags than business)

The company billed me for the hosting automatically.  That reminded me I should update a couple of pages.  It was gone, and it was parked!  I did a whois and found they bought it less than a month after I paid last year for two years.  I did update a couple of pages after I paid last year so it was working for a bit.  

I contacted the company and they were snarky.  They said that the CC payment hadn't gone through on the 24th of may.. which was true, for some reason the CC company thought using the CC online was suspicious, due to the fact it had never been used for that before.  It was cleared up and worked the next day.  I pointed out to them that the second payment had gone through.  Got a snarky reply that I had no idea what I was talking about and I must not have got the "it didn't work email"

So the CC was contacted and provided a statement for that month, which clearly shows the payment went through and was charged to the account.  Armed with this knowledge I emailed them back saying I had the statement, and would a scan do or did they need it mailed to them.

That was 2 weeks ago.  What should I (can I) do?  I am just so bummed I really liked that domain name.

TL;DR: Company let my domain lapse, bought it themselves, and are being uncooperative.  I have proof of payment, but they're not listening.  What can I do?

3. "You can also try contacting the domain registrar's abuse department. They may be able to help you get your domain back." (u/abuse_department)

5. "You might want to consider registering a new domain name and moving your site to a different registrar. It's not worth the hassle to try to get your old domain back." (u/web_developer)

TITLE: I (27/F) fooled around with a boy(25) that I like, but just met two weeks ago - do we talk about it?

POST: My roommate introduced me to his newest coworker about two weeks ago, and he's become a regular visitor and occasional overnight guest at the house ever since. We get along pretty well, and I think he's really cute. Definitely someone I would love to have in my life in some manner or another. I feel as though he's everything I've been wanting in a guy, but it's also a little early to make that call. Perhaps it's just the loneliness talking. We haven't spent much time with just the two of us.

Anyway, we're all kind of transient in our living situation at the moment - he's camping and I'm sharing an RV with my two roommates (a couple). It was snowy a few nights ago, so he crashed with us. I offered to share the couch bed so he didn't have to sleep on the floor (really just a ploy to cuddle). 

Well, I was just planning on cuddling, but the next thing I know he's slyly moving his arm around my waist, and hinted for me to make a move. I didn't object. One thing leads to another and we end up fooling around. 

It was great, and I'd totally do it again. I want to have this kid in some way, be it FWB, casual dating, or a long term relationship. Thing is, neither of us have mentioned it yet, and I'm not sure if I should? We've just been carrying on like nothing ever went down, but I'm afraid if it doesn't get brought up, I'll miss my opportunity. I also can't really read how he's feeling about it. 

What the hell do I say to him? Anything? Suggest we do it again? Send him a sexy text message? Keep quiet and wait for him? I'm bad at boys.

TL;DR: I fooled around with a guy I like, but just met two weeks ago. We haven't talked about it, and I'm unsure what to do. Should I bring it up or just keep quiet and wait for him to make a move?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. It's better to be upfront and clear about your intentions than to leave him wondering or feeling uncertain. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoyed our time together the other night. I was wondering if you felt the same way and if we could explore the possibility of something more?'"
* "I agree with the above comment. It's always better to be honest and direct. You can also ask him how he's feeling and what he's looking for in a relationship. This will give you a better idea of whether or not he's interested in pursuing something with you."
* "I think you should wait a bit before bringing it up. You've only known each other for two weeks, and it's still early days. You can keep the lines of communication open by continuing to hang out and get to know each other better. If you feel like there's a connection and you're both on the same page, then you can start having conversations about your feelings and intentions."
* "I think you should send him a sexy text message. Just kidding! But seriously, you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoyed our time together the other night. I was wondering if you felt the same way and if we could explore the possibility of something more?'"
* "I think you should keep quiet and wait for him to make a move. You don't want to put too much pressure on the situation and risk scaring him off. Just continue to hang out and get to know each other better, and see where things go naturally."
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about your feelings and intentions. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoyed our time together the other night.

TITLE: My 10 year wedding anniversary is coming up and, unfortunately, we'll be totally unable to have any sort of real celebration. What can I do?

POST: So, long story short, we've been together more than 15 years, married for 10, no kids yet, and we love to travel. We've always traveled kind of thriftily, but I was planning a 10 Year Balls-to-the-Wall something or other until we got a little bad news: she needs back surgery, and she needs it fairly quickly. I started working to move my plans up on the calendar, no matter what the changes cost me, but then I found out that she's on strict orders not to travel while awaiting surgery. FML.

Her recovery time will be a small number of months, but in the mean time I'd like to commemorate the date with something a little more special than a really nice dinner, etc. To make matters more complicated, the surgery is only a few days after our anniversary date and it's happening in another city (Houston), so we'll be several hundred miles from most of our friends and all of our family except for her parents.

And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've looked into getting some of our friends to come down and have some sort of a party, but I couldn't get anywhere with that for a variety of reasons (not least of which was the aforementioned hundreds of miles of travel). I've rescheduled our whirlwind trip for as soon as she can reasonably be expected to be capable of travel, but that won't be for several months.

What can I do?

TL;DR: Wife needs back surgery, can't travel, and our 10 year anniversary is coming up. What can I do to make it special despite the circumstances?

TITLE: My [21 M] boyfriend and I [20 F] have been dealing with alcohol/cheating related issues...

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for around 7 months now....it's pretty serious and we're really in love. I can't imagine being with anyone besides him. We get along beautifully and he always knows how to make me feel better. 

However, the first two weeks of school, one when I was here and one when I wasn't, my boyfriend got so incredibly black out drunk and cheated on me twice.
He has a history of alcoholism in his family and he has always been a heavy drinker, so his blacking out is not uncommon.
In the first instance he was at school a week before it started so he was just partying. He got so drunk that a girl who raped him last year (before we were together) I guess found him again and the same situation played out. They had sex but he really didn't remember until this past week. 
The other situation was him being blackout when I stayed in and his phone died so he couldn't answer my messages or calls and he called me at 4 AM from the floor of his apartment looking for me asking me where he had been all night and I, of course, couldn't answer. Turns out he had seen his ex girlfriend and she gave him a blowjob.
It honestly disgusts me so much that that happened but I have always chalked it up to his drinking. He's getting better with it, but now it just causes all of our fights because he is so ridiculous when he drinks.

I am not sure what to do....

TL;DR: My boyfriend cheated on me twice while blacked out from drinking, and I'm unsure what to do.

TITLE: Help with bringing a pseudo-outdoor cat indoors?

POST: This cat currently lives on our front porch as our outdoor cat, we acquired him pretty recently. He was abandoned by a neighbor's brother, and has more than likely only been an outdoor cat for a few months. He wants to come inside desperately, and we want to let him inside. He's fully clawed, so we're worried he might tear the place up, and also wondering if he'd take to a litterbox. We could always get him declawed, but the housetraining thing is my real concern. He's extremely friendly and obviously very accustomed to people, and has always been very well-behaved when we let him indoors to warm up (winter is approaching in my neck of the woods). Any thoughts or tips?

TL;DR: We want to bring our pseudo-outdoor cat indoors, but worried about him tearing up the place and housetraining. He's friendly, well-behaved, and accustomed to people. Any advice?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/CatLady99**: "I've done this with multiple cats, and it's not easy, but it's worth it. Start by setting up a 'catio' or a screened-in porch where he can get used to being indoors but still have access to the outdoors. This will help him get used to the sights and smells of being indoors. As for housetraining, it's going to take time and patience. You'll need to establish a routine and stick to it. Take him outside frequently, and reward him with treats when he uses the litterbox. It's also important to provide multiple litterboxes and keep them clean. Declawing is not necessary, and it's actually a pretty invasive surgery. Just be prepared for some accidents along the way."
2. **u/FelineFanatic**: "I agree with CatLady99, setting up a catio is a great idea. Also, make sure to provide plenty of vertical space for him to climb and scratch. Cats need to scratch to maintain their nails and stretch their muscles. You can provide scratching posts or pads to redirect his scratching behavior. As for housetraining, it's all about consistency and positive reinforcement. Take him outside frequently, and reward him with treats when he uses the litterbox. You can also try using a litterbox with low sides or a ramp to make it easier for him to get in and out."
3. **u/PurrfectPaws**: "I've had success with using a 'litterbox training pad' to help with housetraining. It's a pad that you place in a designated area, and it's designed to absorb accidents. You can also try using a litterbox with a low sides or a ramp to make it easier for him to get in and out. As for declawing, I would strongly advise against it. It's a painful and invasive surgery that can lead to long-term health problems. Instead, focus on providing plenty of scratching posts and pads to redirect his scratching behavior."
4. **u/CatDad**: "I've been through this process with my own cat, and it's not easy, but it's worth it. Start by setting up a 'catio' or a screened-in porch, and gradually introduce him to the indoors. Take him outside frequently, and reward him with treats when he uses the litterbox. It's also important to provide plenty of vertical space for him to climb and scratch. As for declawing, I would strongly advise against it. It's a painful and invasive surgery that can lead to long-term health problems. Instead, focus on providing plenty of scratching posts and pads to redirect his scratching behavior."

**Common Themes:**

* Setting up a catio or screened-in porch to help the cat get used to being indoors
* Establishing a routine and sticking to it for housetraining
* Providing plenty of vertical space for the cat to climb and scratch
* Using positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior
* Avoiding declawing and instead focusing on providing scratching posts and pads to redirect scratching behavior

**Takeaways:**

* Bringing a pseudo-outdoor cat indoors requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement
* Setting up a catio or screened-in porch can help the cat get used to being indoors
* Housetraining will take time and effort, but establishing a routine and providing multiple litterboxes can help
* Declawing is not necessary and can lead to long-term health problems, instead focus on providing scratching posts and pads to redirect scratching behavior.

TITLE: I [23 F] am still thinking about my ex-boyfriend [23 M] of 5 years almost everyday. How can I move on?

POST: My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me in early April. It came out of left field for me but apparently he hadn't been feeling the same about me for a while. There were no signs as far as I could tell, everything seemed normal. We had even hung out the previous weekend and everything was fine. Maybe I was missing the signs.

Anyway, since then I have not been able to stop thinking about him almost every single day. I'm not depressed or unable to enjoy life (surprisingly since i've battled depression and anxiety in the past) and am even having some really awesome things happen in my life. But he's always in the back of my head. I think the way he broke up with me really messed with me. I'm mostly confused and disappointed as to why and how he ended things.  

His explanation was all over the place and although we met a week after he broke up with me to clear things up, I still have a ton of questions that I feel deserve answers. 

My question is, is it best to just continue what I'm doing which is focusing on other things like work, family, friends, myself, etc.? Or should I try to contact him to get a better explanation of what went wrong?

We had said we would try to remain friends but we both needed time and agreed that when we were ready we would contact the other person.

TL;DR: I'm still thinking about my ex-boyfriend of 5 years almost every day. We broke up in April and I'm not sure how to move on. Should I just focus on other things or try to contact him to get a better understanding of what went wrong?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're still holding onto a lot of emotions and questions. I think it's great that you're focusing on other things, but it might be helpful to have a conversation with him to clear the air. It might not change anything, but it could help you move on. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to have that conversation or that it might not give you the answers you're looking for."
* "I think you're giving him too much power over your emotions. You deserve to move on and find happiness. Don't get me wrong, it's okay to acknowledge the past and what happened, but don't let it consume you. Focus on yourself and the things that make you happy. You're strong and capable of moving on."
* "I think it's great that you're focusing on other things, but it's also okay to acknowledge your feelings and not rush into moving on. It's normal to take time to process and grieve the loss of a relationship. Maybe try journaling or talking to a therapist to work through your emotions. And if you do decide to contact him, make sure you're prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to have a conversation or that it might not be what you're expecting."
* "I think you should try to contact him. You deserve to know what went wrong and why he ended things. It might not change anything, but it could help you move on and find closure. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to have that conversation or that it might not give you the answers you're looking for."

TITLE: My [22F] recent ex [23M] of 3 year relationship suddenly has an attitude about moving out. I am so uncomfortable. What should I do?

POST: My boyfriend of 3 years was blatantly ignoring me and apathetic and I decided to break up with him because I was the only one putting effort into keeping the relationship together. He hurt me (flirting with exes, lying, trying to berate me) way too often and enough was enough. We live together, but he said he would be the one to move out since I'm recovering from an injury and I have fish that would be a pain to move. I told him I want to cut ties and I do not want to talk to him anymore. I do not want to be his friend.

I have heard him sobbing in the other room almost every night since the breakup. We have exchanged some letters but his letters don't make sense. He keeps saying he loves me and he doesn't know what he wants... That his emotions say he's "making a continuous mistake" but he is trying to be rational and needs space. He doesn't seem to accept the reality that I am DONE. It's over. I'm ready to move on. I feel like I don't love him anymore. 

Tonight I confronted him because my alternative plan fell through. He said that moving out was not a priority for him. He was very cold about it and seemed to be putting on an act. Is he trying to get in a last ounce of control? 

What are my options? I live in a city where it is hard to find decent rent prices. My cousin agreed to move in with me here, but my ex doesn't seem to want to leave. I need to give my landlord 30 days notice before leaving. I feel like I should just give her the notice tonight and abandon the apartment and just settle wherever I end up. I could squeeze into a studio but I'm a student and would be paying way more than I am now. I might reach out to my family to help fund an apartment by myself.

What should I do?

TL;DR: My ex of 3 years is being super clingy and won't move out. He's saying he loves me and doesn't know what he wants. I'm done and ready to move on. What are my options? Should I give my landlord notice and move out ASAP or try to find a new place to live?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your ex is trying to guilt trip you into staying with him. He's using his sobbing and 'I love you' lines to try to get a reaction out of you. You've already told him you're done, and it's time to respect that. Give your landlord notice and start looking for a new place to live. You deserve better than someone who can't accept the end of the relationship."
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: "I would suggest taking a step back and prioritizing your own needs right now. You've been through a lot with this relationship, and you deserve some time to focus on yourself. Don't feel pressured to make any rash decisions or compromises. Take your time, and when you're ready, you can start looking for a new place to live. Remember, you're not responsible for your ex's emotions or actions."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're done. You've already given him the boot, and it's time to move on. Don't let him guilt trip you into staying or trying to make things work. You're not his personal therapist or doormat. Give your landlord notice, and start looking for a new place to live. You'll be fine, and you'll be better off without him."
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I think it's great that you're considering reaching out to your family for help with finding a new place to live. That's a great support system to have. Just remember to prioritize your own needs and well-being during this time. You don't have to rush into anything or make any decisions that make you uncomfortable. Take your time, and when you're ready, you can start looking for a new place to live."

**Community Response:** The community is overwhelmingly in support of the OP's decision to end the relationship and move on. Many commenters advise against giving in to the ex's guilt trips and emotional manipulation, and instead encourage the OP to prioritize their own needs and well-being. The community also offers words of encouragement and support, reminding the OP that they deserve better than someone who can't accept the end of the relationship. Overall, the response is one of solidarity and empowerment, urging the OP to take control of their life and move forward with confidence.

TITLE: I (20f) am having a hard time coping with my baggage

POST: I have the greatest boyfriend (19m) in the world right now. He is thoughtful, kind, he does everything in the world to make me feel important and special and I try to do the same for him. We have been together for about eight months now.

However right around the time we met I was exiting a really bad relationship that ended in me terminating a pregnancy. My current SO knows that that happened, and accepts me for who I am now, which given my past might be more then I deserve. On top of that from about feb-mid april my hormones were really nuts causing me to just be what felt like a shadow of who I was, but after some recent medication I feel a million times better.

I suppose my problem is that a part of me wants to run away from this relationship because I think I might have jumped into it too soon. But I know I truly love my SO and I'm afraid if I tell him what I'm feeling he will take it the wrong way and it will hurt him. I know that communicating what I'm feeling would be the best thing for us, but I just don't know how to have that conversation.

TL;DR: I'm 20f, been with my 19m SO for 8 months. I have baggage from a previous relationship and recent hormonal issues. I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I'm ready for a relationship, but I love my SO and don't know how to have the conversation about my feelings.

COMMENTS:

* "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure about your feelings, especially when you're still healing from past traumas. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your SO about how you're feeling. It's better to be upfront and honest than to let your feelings simmer and potentially cause more harm down the line. Remember that your SO loves and accepts you for who you are, and they want to work through this with you. Take some time to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it, and then have the conversation. You got this!"
* "OP, I'm so proud of you for recognizing your feelings and wanting to communicate with your SO. That takes a lot of courage! I would suggest framing your conversation around your own feelings and needs, rather than focusing on what you think your SO might do or think. For example, you could say something like 'Hey, I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I'm not sure if I'm ready for a relationship. I love you and I value our relationship, but I need some time to focus on myself and figure some things out.' This way, you're being honest and open about your feelings, but you're also giving your SO the space to respond and work through this with you. Good luck, and remember that you're not alone!"
* "OP, I think it's great that you're recognizing your feelings and wanting to communicate with your SO. However, I would caution against jumping to conclusions about what your SO might do or think. Instead, focus on having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and needs. Remember that your SO loves and accepts you for who you are, and they want to work through this with you. Take some time to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it, and then have the conversation. You got this!"
* "OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about your feelings. I would suggest taking some time to focus on yourself and your own healing before having a conversation with your SO. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and get some support. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Take care of yourself and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it."

TITLE: Me [20M] with my GF[20F] When would you stay with crazy?

POST: I'll try to keep it somewhat brief. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. Once we were dating for awhile I realized she wasn't the most stable person... at all. She had very bad depression, anxiety, and migraines. She also gets jealous easily, has trust issues, and is slightly overweight. It took me a long time and a lot of effort to get her to go to her doctor to start taking meds. I tried to get her to see a therapist as well, but she only ended up going a few times and then gave up. When we were in college together still, her depression/anxiety was so bad that she gave up on going to classes and flunked out. She doesn't have her license, she currently works a minimum wage job and it's been 1-2 years since she's been in college. She was supposed to go last spring but that didn't work out, and she's supposed to go an upcoming semester but I'm not sure if she'll follow through. Her family is also pretty crazy which doesn't help the whole situation.

---

I see many people give the advice of leaving someone who seems depressed or has anxiety because "they're crazy." I don't really see these people as crazy unless it's a serious case and they're doing extremely immature, insane things. To me, it seems a little rude to just assume they're crazy and tell people to run away. For whatever reason I decided to stay and help her instead of running away. She's definitely improved a lot, but still has some issues. I guess I cared about her enough to spend a lot of my time and energy to stay and help. My question to you is: When would you stay with "crazy"? What would make you stay, what would make you leave?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a girl who has depression, anxiety, and other issues. She's improved a lot, but still has some problems. I've stayed with her and helped her, but I'm wondering when would you stay with someone who has these issues. What would make you stay, what would make you leave?

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're trying to help her and be supportive. It's not always easy to deal with someone who has mental health issues, but it sounds like you're making an effort to understand and help her. I think it's important to remember that people with mental health issues are not 'crazy' or 'broken', they're just struggling. It's not their fault and it's not something they can just'snap out of'. I think you're doing a great job and I hope you continue to be supportive and understanding."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to stay and help her, but I also think you need to take care of yourself. It can be draining to deal with someone who has mental health issues, and you need to make sure you're not sacrificing your own well-being in the process. Have you considered couples therapy to help you both work through your issues?"
* "I think it's admirable that you're willing to stay and help her, but I also think you need to set some boundaries. It's okay to say no to things that are too much for you to handle, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs. You can't pour from an empty cup, so to speak. Make sure you're taking care of yourself and setting boundaries to protect your own well-being."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to stay and help her, but I also think you need to be realistic about what you can expect. People with mental health issues can be unpredictable and it's not always easy to deal with. You need to be prepared for the ups and downs and have a plan in place for when things get tough. It's not always easy, but it's worth it if you're willing to put in the effort."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to stay and help her, but I also think you need to consider your own feelings and needs. Are you happy in the relationship? Do you feel fulfilled and supported? If not, then maybe it's time to re-evaluate and consider whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and if this relationship isn't providing that for you, then maybe it's time to move on."

---

**Conclusion:**

The post received a mix of comments, some encouraging the OP to continue being supportive and understanding, while others advised him to set boundaries and prioritize his own well-being. The comments highlighted the importance of self-care and setting realistic expectations when dealing with someone who has mental health issues. The OP's willingness to stay and help his girlfriend was seen as admirable, but also cautioned that it's essential to prioritize his own needs and well-being in the process. Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave a relationship with someone who has mental health issues is a personal one, and the OP was encouraged to consider his own feelings and needs in making that decision.

TITLE: **A personal finance tax, income, and asset brain teaser**

POST: Surveying /r/personalfinance for possible creative solutions or interesting perspectives on a unique situation. 

The subject is a 62 year old widow. Here are the measurables:
*Assets*: $800,000 in real estate. A primary and secondary residence of approximately equal value. Approx $1,200,000 in relatively liquid assets, roughly $700,000 of which are in tax-deferred accounts. 

*Income*
*~85,000 (before taxes)

*Expenses*
Subject makes an approximately $1,200 contribution to a tax deferred account each month, but otherwise spends almost all or most of her income to maintain the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. This includes upkeep of both properties, travel, and general enjoyment.  It is unlikely that a change in lifestyle is possible. The vacation property is rented on occasion. 

Here is where it gets interesting: Subject has approximately **$400,000** in a tax loss carry forward.  Subject's investments have not been performing terribly well as of late and subject does not have much in the way of capital gains to offset the tax-loss carry forward. Additionally, Most of subjects liquid assets are in tax deferred accounts.  Subject has about $570,000 in a taxable account. 

Subject would need to realize an approximately 80% gain in the taxable account to use up all of the tax loss (in addition, $3,000 each year of the tax loss can be applied to ordinary income). 

**Questions**
1) How can subject position herself to make the best use of her tax loss?
2) How should subject be allocating her assets to maintain her lifestyle and prepare for retirement? She plans to work 8-10 more years.

TL;DR: A 62 year old widow with $800,000 in real estate, $1,200,000 in liquid assets, and a tax loss carry forward of $400,000. She spends most of her income and wants to know how to make the best use of her tax loss and allocate her assets to maintain her lifestyle and prepare for retirement.

**Comments**

* "I would recommend consulting a financial advisor to get personalized advice. They can help you create a customized plan to maximize your tax loss and optimize your asset allocation."
* "Have you considered using the tax loss to offset capital gains from the tax-deferred accounts? You could potentially use the tax loss to offset gains from the accounts and then rebalance the accounts to maintain your target asset allocation."
* "I would suggest considering a Roth conversion to get the tax-deferred accounts into a more tax-efficient position. This could help you reduce your tax liability and make the most of your tax loss."
* "You may want to consider using the tax loss to offset ordinary income, rather than trying to realize a gain in the taxable account. This could help you reduce your tax liability and maintain your lifestyle."
* "Have you considered using the tax loss to offset the income from the rental property? This could help you reduce your tax liability and increase your cash flow."

**Additional Information**

* The subject has a high-deductible health insurance plan and has a flexible spending account (FSA) for medical expenses.
* The subject has a mortgage on the primary residence, but the mortgage is relatively low and the interest rate is low.
* The subject has a small business retirement plan, but it is not a significant portion of her overall retirement savings.
* The subject is considering purchasing an annuity to provide a guaranteed income stream in retirement.

**Edit**

* The subject has a small inheritance coming in the next few years, which will add to her liquid assets.
* The subject is considering downsizing her primary residence, but is hesitant to do so due to emotional attachment to the property.

TITLE: [M/18]Should he really be mad about what I[F/18] just asked about?

POST: My bf and I have been together 2 years. We are currently in a LDR and he is in Hawaii but possibly moving back soon. Haven't seen him in 3 months. 

This isn't even a big deal. Of course I get jealous of him talking to other pretty girls...but really, who doesn't? 

So, I was on Facebook and it constantly pops up on my newsfeed that he is liking all these other pictures of these girls he is friends with. (Note: most of his friends are girls. He has always been that way AND he has had huge crushes on all of them at one point in time before we started dating.) And I was a little jealous because I want more attention from him. So, out of curiosity, I asked about it. At first he said he didn't like any pictures. But then he said his brother does it most of the time.(His brother goes on his account often) Then he got really pissed at me over it. I didn't even sound mad about it. I kinda made a joke out of it when I asked. It's just frustrating because now he won't talk to me.

TL;DR: I asked my bf why he was liking pictures of other girls on Facebook and he got mad at me. He said his brother does it most of the time, but he still got upset. Now he won't talk to me.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think he's being ridiculous. You were just asking a question out of curiosity and he's overreacting. Maybe he's feeling insecure about your LDR and is taking it out on you."
* "I agree with the above comment. It sounds like he's being really possessive and controlling. You're not asking for much, just a simple explanation. If he can't handle that, then maybe he's not the right guy for you."
* "I think you should try to talk to him about it again and see what's really going on. Maybe there's something he's not telling you. But if he's still being stubborn and won't talk to you, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I'm a guy and I have to say, I would probably get mad too if my girlfriend was asking me about liking pictures of other girls. It's not that big of a deal, but it's still a sensitive topic. Maybe try to approach it from a different angle and ask him how he feels about it instead of just asking why he's liking pictures."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about why you're really asking this question. Are you genuinely curious or are you trying to stir up drama? If it's the latter, then maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with your boyfriend instead of trying to create unnecessary tension."

**Reddit's Take:**

The majority of the comments are in agreement that the boyfriend is being unreasonable and overreacting. Many users suggest that the girlfriend was just asking a simple question out of curiosity and that the boyfriend's reaction is a sign of insecurity and possessiveness. Some users also suggest that the girlfriend should try to talk to her boyfriend again and see what's really going on, while others advise her to reevaluate the relationship if her boyfriend continues to be stubborn and uncommunicative. A few users take a more neutral stance, suggesting that the girlfriend should approach the topic from a different angle and ask her boyfriend how he feels about it instead of just asking why he's liking pictures. Overall, the subreddit is divided on the issue, but the majority seems to side with the girlfriend.

TITLE: Job change question

POST: Hello everyone, I hope that you guys can give me some guidance on an important decision I have to make. I have been working for 11 months at a big accounting firm. My background is in IT and wanted to do something more closely related to technology. I started interviewing and I received an offer for $7K more than what I am currently making. This came as great news, except I just learned that HR is going to get me an opportunity within my current firm to do something a lot cooler but I'd keep the same salary. The problem with the new offer is the distance to my current place and where my SO lives. I live currently close to Downtown and she lives 30 minutes south, the new job would be 40 minutes north west of where I currently live. Just before I got the offer I was looking to move closer to her, but that would mean about 1.5 hrs of driving every day. I have made numbers and the raise covers the price of gas. Is there anything I should do in addition to that to be able to make a better decision? I feel like if I stay at my current firm I'll be able to get an even bigger raise if I move out in the next few years, but not sure that this is the case. I'm confident since unemployment numbers are steadily going down every day. What would you do?

TL;DR: I have a job offer for $7K more than my current salary, but it's 40 minutes away from my current place and my SO's place. I also have an opportunity within my current firm to do something cool, but I'd keep the same salary. What should I do?

ANSWERS:

* "I'd say take the new job offer. The extra $7K is a significant increase and could make a big difference in your quality of life. The commute might be a bit longer, but it's not the end of the world. You can always find ways to make the most of your time during the commute, like listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Plus, you'll have more money to spend on things that matter to you. If you're worried about the distance, you could always look into finding a place to live that's halfway between your current place and your SO's place."
* "I'd say take the opportunity within your current firm. You're already familiar with the company culture and you know what to expect. The extra $7K might be tempting, but it's not worth the stress and uncertainty of a new job. Plus, you'll have more job security and a better sense of stability. You can always try to negotiate a raise within your current firm if you feel like you're not being paid fairly."
* "I'd say weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully. Consider your priorities and what matters most to you. If you value the extra money and are willing to deal with the longer commute, then the new job offer might be the better choice. But if you prioritize job security and stability, then the opportunity within your current firm might be the better choice. Ultimately, the decision is yours and you should choose what's best for you and your SO."
* "I'd say consider the long-term implications of each option. If you take the new job offer, you might be stuck in a long commute for the foreseeable future. But if you take the opportunity within your current firm, you might have more opportunities for advancement and a better sense of job security. You should also think about your SO's perspective and how the longer commute might affect your relationship. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but you should consider all the factors before making a decision."

TITLE: I've only ever liked 1 girl, and i can't get over her?

POST: Hi. I'm 23, male.

I knew her since i was like 14, she was a year younger than me. We used to hang out almost daily for years - she lived just down the road from me. We were really good friends, and our friendship lasted until i was about 19. I was a really naive teen, and never realized she had feelings for me, even though she gave some massive signals. 

I had strong emotional feelings for her too, but i didn't really understand them at the time. I was a late bloomer. I went through a lot of hardships  and i slipped into a bit of a destructive state. I ended up pushing her away, i did it to protect her, but it ruined our friendship. I imagine she hates me now. 

I've only seen her once since (been 5 years), and we both completely blanked each other. I haven't attempted to contact her or anything, i could quite easily, but i don't want to talk to her and find out she hates me now. I still think about her a fair bit, and even have dreams about her. (non sexual). I know it's weird, but i'm not stalking her or involving her in any way so it's not hurting, right? 

Well, that's the past. The present is the problem. I don't feel attracted to anybody, sexually or emotionally. I have options, i'm not bad looking and i get interest on nights out, and a couple of friends who like me. But none of them interest me. 

I know this is really pathetic, but i don't know what to do. I want to get over her, but i still have the problem of not finding anyone else attractive. I've only slept with one girl ever, and weirdly, she looked a lot like the girl i liked. Still the sex was no more enjoyable than masturbating, and was all very average.

TL;DR: I've only ever liked one girl, and i can't get over her. I've pushed her away, and now i'm stuck in this rut where i don't find anyone else attractive. I'm 23, and i feel like i'm wasting my life.

TITLE: Am I an asshole or wrong to stay friend with my straight best friend of 4 years (22M) if I'm (21M) gay?

POST: I'm gay. Just came out. I'm 22. My best friend for years has been a straight guy.

I don't let my orientation define me. I hate saying I'm gay. But I always think about this. 

I've crushed on him since the day I've met him. I've just dealt with it since he means a lot as a friend. Usually I don't associate with crushes for the heartache. But this time I am. 

I feel bad because no matter how much I try not to its just biology that my feelings for him will change how I act as a friend. I'm naturally just gonna feel a bit different around him because of the attraction. 

We tell each other everything. Our relationship is reciprocal. We hang out. Text every day. Make sure we see each other when we both busy. We share feelings. He talks about his girlfriends with me, etc. I try to protect him and be a friend and he protects me too, but I can't help but feel like I wish I could have him. I don't let those feelings change how I act though. 

He knows I'm gay and doesn't care. He knew a year ago before I told anyone. 

I just feel like an asshole if I'm going to try to find a boyfriend but in my head I love another guy I still see and talk to all the time. 

I always make male friends. I like them more. But I always crush on them eventually. I have a lot of love. I feel like this is wrong too.

I get told its weird, cheating, wrong, etc. And I get told to find new friends and a real boyfriend. 

I feel like I'm doing something really wrong and that our relationship is extremely weird compared to most other peoples friends.

TL;DR: I'm gay, I've had a straight best friend for 4 years, I've had feelings for him since the beginning, but I've tried to keep it hidden and not let it affect our friendship. I'm now questioning whether it's okay to stay friends with him while I'm looking for a boyfriend.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345678**: "Honestly, it's not weird to have feelings for someone, even if they're not reciprocated. What's important is that you're not acting on those feelings and respecting your friend's boundaries. If you're genuinely happy with your friend and your friendship, then it's okay to continue it. Just be honest with yourself and your friend about your feelings and make sure you're not leading him on or making him uncomfortable."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "It's understandable that you're questioning your feelings, but it's important to remember that your friend is not a prize to be won or a conquest to be had. He's a person with his own agency and feelings, and you need to respect that. If you're looking for a romantic partner, it's okay to explore that, but don't use your friend as a crutch or a distraction. Be honest with yourself and your friend about your intentions and boundaries."
3. **u/straight_guy_here**: "I'm a straight guy, and I have to say, I'm a bit surprised that you're questioning your friendship with me. But honestly, I think it's great that you're being honest with yourself about your feelings. I've had friends who have had crushes on me before, and it's always a bit awkward, but we've always managed to work through it and come out stronger on the other side. If you're happy with our friendship and you're not trying to use me as a way to get over your feelings, then I'm happy to continue our friendship."
4. **u/relationship_expert**: "It's not uncommon for people to have feelings for someone they're close to, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. What's important is that you're not acting on those feelings and you're respecting your friend's boundaries. If you're looking for a romantic partner, it's okay to explore that, but don't use your friend as a distraction or a way to avoid dealing with your feelings. Be honest with yourself and your friend about your intentions and boundaries, and make sure you're not leading him on or making him uncomfortable."



**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling with his feelings for his straight best friend and is questioning whether it's okay to stay friends with him while he's looking for a boyfriend. The top comments offer a range of perspectives, from understanding and supportive to cautionary and concerned. Ultimately, the decision to stay friends with someone you have feelings for depends on your intentions, boundaries, and the other person's feelings and boundaries. It's important to be honest with yourself and the other person about your feelings and to respect their boundaries. If you're looking for a romantic partner, it's okay to explore that, but don't use your friend as a distraction or a way to avoid dealing with your feelings. Be honest with yourself and your friend about your intentions and boundaries, and make sure you're not leading him on or making him uncomfortable.

TITLE: My boyfriend wants to hang out with someone he used to have a crush on.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost six years, and we're in college now. When he was a junior in high school (we had been together for 3 years around this time), he developed a crush on a girl in his class. He liked her for a while, and didn't tell me until 6 months later, when he was "kind of getting over it." It's been years, and he hasn't really spoken to her, but today she IMs him out of nowhere and asks him to go with her to get her tattoo. He accepted and then told me about it. Although she is not into men, this has caused me some distress. Am I being paranoid?

TL;DR: My boyfriend had a crush on someone in high school, and she just asked him to get a tattoo with her. He accepted and told me about it. I'm feeling uneasy about it.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is just being friendly and helping out a friend. I don't think you have anything to worry about. Unless he's still got feelings for her, which he's already told you he's 'kind of getting over it' about."
2. **u/Redditor99**: "I think you're being paranoid. It's not like he's going on a date with her or anything. He's just getting a tattoo with her. If you're really concerned, you could always ask him how he feels about her now and if he's still got feelings for her."
3. **u/username123**: "I think you should have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's understandable that you're uneasy about it, and he might not even realize how you feel. Just be open and honest with him, and I'm sure you'll work it out."
4. **u/anotherusername**: "I don't think you should be worried about it at all. It's just a tattoo, and it's not like he's going to fall in love with her again. You've been together for almost six years, and you've built a strong relationship. I'm sure you'll get through this just fine."
5. **u/someoneelse**: "I think you're being a bit too possessive. He's not doing anything wrong, and you're not his property. If you're really concerned, you could always ask him to take a picture of the tattoo and show it to you afterwards. That way, you'll know exactly what happened and can put your mind at ease."

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my GF [25 F], duration 9 months, girlfriend is hanging out with a guy who likes her and it's making me really jealous

POST: My girlfriend (25) and I (28) started going out about 9 months ago. We moved in together after about a month or so and it didn't work out. We broke up after about 6 months because neither of us were happy. About a month after we broke up we started hanging out again and found that we both still really cared for each other and became FwB. After a couple of those sessions we had a talk about what we were doing and how we were feeling. Long story short we decided that we wanted to make the relationship work and to take it slow. We also told each other the people that we had hooked up with while we were on break so to be completely honest with each other. 

One guy she hooked up with really liked her and asked her out. They knew each other through work and initially she thought he was gay (this was when we were dating the first time). 

Fast forward to last night she told me that he'd called around 8.30 and they'd spoken on the phone for about 90 minutes, mostly about work, some about me and some about other stuff. I have been really unsettled by this since she told me. She called and we talked about it on the phone but I still can't shake this feeling of jealousy. Thoughts?

TL;DR: GF and I have been together for 9 months, we broke up and got back together as FwB, now she's hanging out with a guy who likes her and it's making me really jealous.

COMMENTS:

* "It's normal to feel jealous, but it's also important to remember that your GF is an individual with her own thoughts and feelings. If she's willing to be open and honest with you about her interactions with this guy, that's a good sign. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can work through this together." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I would suggest having a conversation with your GF about what you're feeling and why. It's possible that she's not even aware of the impact her interactions with this guy are having on you. Also, it might be helpful to remind yourself that just because she's talking to this guy doesn't mean she's interested in him romantically. Maybe she's just being friendly or catching up with an acquaintance." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with your feelings, but you need to remember that your GF is an adult and can make her own decisions. If she's willing to talk to you about it and reassure you that she's not interested in this guy, then that's all you can ask for. But if you're feeling this level of jealousy and insecurity, it might be worth taking a step back and reevaluating the relationship. You deserve to feel happy and secure in your relationship." (u/honestyisthebestpolicy)
* "I think it's important to remember that it's okay to feel jealous, but it's not okay to let that jealousy consume you. Try to have a conversation with your GF about how you're feeling and see if you can work through this together. Also, it might be helpful to remind yourself that your GF is an individual with her own thoughts and feelings, and she's not going to change just to make you feel better." (u/relationshipcoach)

TITLE: What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about?

POST: I'm not proud of it, but I once lied about having a pet snake to impress a girl I had a crush on. I told her that I had a pet snake named Slinky and that I loved taking care of it. She seemed really interested and we started talking about our shared love of reptiles. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't think about the consequences of my lie. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she comes over to my place and asks to see Slinky. I'm like "oh, um, I think I left him at my friend's house" and she's all "but I thought you said you loved taking care of him?" And I'm like "oh, yeah, I do! I just, uh, forgot to mention that I had to leave him at my friend's house for a few days". She looked at me with this mixture of confusion and disappointment and I knew I was in trouble. 

I ended up confessing the truth and apologizing profusely. She was understanding, but I could tell she was still a little hurt. I learned a valuable lesson that day: honesty is always the best policy, even if it's hard to admit the truth.

TL;DR: I lied about having a pet snake to impress a girl, got caught, and learned a valuable lesson about honesty.

TITLE: Me [23M] and my SO [21F] are having issues because of her sister [23F].

POST: Basically my GF and I are fighting because her sister does not want her to move to the city that I live in. My GF wants to pursue school and her sister is trying to make her stay at their hometown.

She insists that her sister is limiting her opportunities, which for her is becoming a celebrity in anyway possible, and that going to school will end it. Of course this makes me rage because I and my GF believe that school would be a better option.

I am not sure what to do because I am trying to respect her sister. But I am on the verge of raging and telling her what I really think. She tries to pursue unrealistic dreams by basically selling herself to 60 year old millionaires.

TL;DR: My GF's sister is trying to control her and I'm torn between respecting her sister and telling my GF the truth.

TITLE: (FL) Cashier won't do her job properly. I want to fire her but HR says no because of religious reasons.

POST: Hi, legaladvice. I can't believe I'm in this situation.

I was recently promoted to Store Manager of a grocery store after the original manager quit (I was assisstant manager before for about 6 months).

We hired a woman, let's call her Sally, a couple of weeks ago. She's not terrible at her job (just basic cashier stuff) but she refuses to process payments that equal $6.66. I know, it sounds crazy.

Our store prices everything ending in 28 cents as a ploy (kinda like Brandsmart). So anything priced at $6.28 will ring up to $6.66 after tax, and it happens quite often that people will buy just that one item (which I've learned after Sally started working here).

Every time this happens, one of the managers or supervisors has to take over because she refuses and sometimes it throws a spanner in the works. I brought it up with HR and they said I can't do anything about it because it's her religious freedom (since 666 is the number of the beast in Christianity).

The thing is, we have the same religion; we even go to the same church! But I don't think she should be able to use that excuse to not ring those transactions. I've offered to move her to another part of the store but she doesn't want to stock or do anything else.

HR warned me not to decrease her hours or I'd get in trouble, but I just don't see how I can do my job properly if I have to take care of petty stuff like this.

Is there a law or something that says I'm right? I don't want to go back to HR without knowing I'm 100% right that she shouldn't have the job if she can't perform all aspects of it.

And if I'm wrong, I suppose I can bear it even if I do think it's ridiculous.

TL;DR: Cashier won't ring up transactions with $6.66 due to religious beliefs. HR says I can't do anything about it. I think it's unfair and I want to know if I'm right.

---

This post is an example of a common issue that arises in the workplace: conflicting values and beliefs. The OP (original poster) is frustrated with the cashier's refusal to perform her job duties due to religious beliefs, and HR is advising against taking any action against the cashier. The OP is seeking legal advice on whether they are right to take action against the cashier.

The issue is complex and raises questions about the balance between an employee's religious beliefs and their job duties. The cashier's refusal to ring up transactions with $6.66 may be seen as a reasonable accommodation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on religion. However, the OP's concerns about the impact on the business and the need for a cashier to perform all aspects of their job duties must also be considered.

A possible solution could be to work with the cashier to find an alternative solution that accommodates her religious beliefs while still allowing her to perform her job duties. For example, the cashier could be assigned to a different register or task that does not involve ringing up transactions with $6.66. Alternatively, the OP could consider reassigning the cashier to a different role within the store that does not require her to perform tasks that conflict with her religious beliefs.

Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the policies and procedures of the store. The OP should consult with HR and consider seeking legal advice to determine the best course of action.

TITLE: Should I (23/f) leave the man I love (27/m) to take my dream job halfway around the world?

POST: So I have just under 48 hours to make a decision that could forever alter the course of my life.

I've been offered a financially lucrative position in a beautiful country that I believe I could enjoy living in. Personally, things aren't so great at home, so were it not for my boyfriend, I would be jumping at the offer.

I've been in an on-again/off-again relationship for four years. He was my first kiss, first everything. I fell hard and never really got back up. We recently decided to try dating again after about a year of pretty much dating without the label.... however, I don't think a relationship (not just with me, with anyone) is what he wants. I think I pressured him into it.

So I have this offer. This dream job. But on the other hand, I have a chance at stability and finally being with the man I love more than my own life. I've never lived in a foreign country and honestly the thought terrifies me. But... what if I stay here? What if the relationship doesn't work out and I'm left here wondering.... what if? for the rest of my life? What if I move and, again, I'm wondering what if? but this time about the relationship?

I really just don't know what to do. I'm so torn. I can't eat or sleep, it's almost some sort of cosmic joke. Why would this offer come right when I have a chance with the person I've dreamed of for years? I just... I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I have a dream job offer in a foreign country, but it means leaving the man I love. I'm torn between taking a chance on my career and staying with the person I've always wanted.

**Comments:**

* "You can't put your life on hold for someone who doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. Take the job and focus on yourself for a change."
* "I understand your concerns, but you can't let fear hold you back from pursuing your dreams. You can always come back to the relationship if it doesn't work out."
* "You're not thinking about the long-term implications of leaving your partner behind. What about the emotional toll it could take on him?"
* "You're being selfish. You're putting your own desires above the well-being of someone you claim to love. Stay with him and figure out a way to make it work."
* "Why do you need to choose between your job and your relationship? Can't you find a way to make it work? Maybe your boyfriend is willing to relocate with you?"
* "You're not thinking about the bigger picture. What about the impact this could have on your mental and emotional health? Take the job and focus on yourself."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You can't control how others feel, but you can control your own decisions. Take the job and see where it takes you."
* "You're not considering the possibility that your boyfriend might be the one holding you back. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to grow and find yourself outside of the relationship."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you really want. Is it the job, or is it the relationship? You can't have both, at least not right now."

**Discussion:**

The post sparks a heated debate among commenters, with some arguing that the OP should prioritize her career and take the job, while others believe she should stay with her boyfriend and figure out a way to make the relationship work. Some commenters point out that the OP is being selfish for putting her own desires above her partner's well-being, while others argue that she has a right to pursue her own happiness.

The discussion highlights the complexities of relationships and career choices, and the difficult decisions that people often face when trying to balance their personal and professional lives. Ultimately, the OP will have to make a decision that is right for her, and the comments provide a range of perspectives to consider.

TITLE: Me [24 F] with the guy I've been seeing [22 M], unsure because of mixed signals

POST: This guy and I have been hanging out for 3 months now. We work together and have known each other for a few years before that. 

It started off as a once or twice a week hang out where we would also have sex. He eventually asked me out on a date, we went to the movies and dinner, for which he paid, even though I tried to offer. From there it escalated to texting, even briefly, everyday and for the past few weeks we have been hanging out three or four times a week. He is super affectionate and is always doing things to help me, whether it be at work, or smaller things when we have been hanging out. 

I'm currently confused though because we hung out Monday night at his house and we were both super tired, so we did not really get into any deep conversations. We just kinda hung around, watched tv, and eventually fell asleep. Usually we will hang out every other day or so or at least there will have been an effort to do so. I texted him last night to see what he was doing, and he responded that he was in a weird mood and feeling under the weather. I responded saying that I hope he felt better thinking that was the end of the conversation. He asked if I was doing anything yet for the night, and I said I didn't have any plans, but that I just thought of hanging out with him. He responded "I was planning on that too earlier, sorry :(".

I am just at a loss of what to think. Am I overthinking this and he just is having a bad week? Or could this be the beginning of a fade? I guess I'm just also disappointed because his dad is gone for the week and he has the house to himself, so I wrongly assumed I guess that we would be hanging out more than once, which I am also worried is clouding my judgment of the situation.

Should I even bother trying to text him again to hang out? Or just give him space and wait to see if he contacts me?

TL;DR: Been seeing guy for 3 months, unsure if he's interested due to mixed signals. He's been super affectionate, but lately there have been some weird responses and lack of effort to hang out. Should I give him space or try to text him again?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you're overthinking it. He's probably just having a bad week. Give him some space and see if he reaches out to you. If not, then you can reassess the situation."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's possible he's just stressed or overwhelmed and needs some time to himself. Don't take it personally and just wait it out."
* "I think you should try to text him again and see how he responds. If he's really interested in you, he'll make an effort to hang out with you. If not, then you can move on."
* "I think you're being too focused on the lack of effort to hang out. What's important is the way he makes you feel. If you feel valued and appreciated when you're together, then that's all that matters."
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate the relationship. If he's not making an effort to hang out with you, then he's not really interested in you. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize you."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're confused and concerned about the lack of effort to hang out. If he's really interested in you, he'll listen to you and make an effort to change his behavior."

---

**Conclusion:**

The OP is unsure about the guy's interest in her due to mixed signals. The comments suggest that she should give him space and wait to see if he reaches out to her. Some comments also suggest that she should try to text him again and see how he responds. Others suggest that she should take a step back and reevaluate the relationship, or have an open and honest conversation with him about her feelings. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP to decide what she wants to do next.

TITLE: My long-distance GF[17F] wouldn't tell a guy(who apparently has a huge crush on her) that she's in a relationship with me[19M] so he could buy her gifts, and wouldn't tell me of this. Was I crazy to be upset?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for 6 months now and everything always goes fine between us. We made it a point to always be honest with each other no matter what, and I have always been faithful to that.

I found out from a mutual friend of ours that a guy she knows has a very big thing for her and has been into her for a while now. I was unaware. This mutual friend also told me that this guy bought my girlfriend gifts, and she told me her mother bought them for her. The reason he buys her gifts is because she's not telling him that she's in a relationship with me, so he's been trying to woo her over. Quite frankly, I was hurt she was keeping our relationship a secret, especially to guys who like her.

She lied to me about the gifts and refused to tell me about all this because she wanted to avoid a conversation about it. Was I right or wrong to be upset about this whole ordeal?

TL;DR: My girlfriend wouldn't tell me that a guy has a crush on her and is buying her gifts, and she lied about the gifts to avoid a conversation about it. I'm upset because I feel like she's not being honest with me.

TITLE: Family using painful nickname and i want them to stop. [25F] [24F] [28F]

POST: My Uncle passed away last week. I loved him like a father and he helped pay for my college. He called me 'Ladybug' as a nickname and always has. Since he has passed, I just don't want to be known by that. My sister [28F]  [24F]and cousin have been calling me this because it reminds them of him. 

We got into an argument over it. I told them I don't want to be called Ladybug, it's something special I shared with my Uncle. I want to be known as Ellie, like they have called me for [25 years]. 

I am not really willing to compromise on this. At this point I kind of want to take a break from them. I am mourning and they keep reminding me of him in painful ways. 

Any idea how to handle this?

TL;DR: My Uncle passed away and I don't want to be called 'Ladybug' anymore. My sister and cousin keep calling me that because it reminds them of him. I want to be known as Ellie, but they won't stop. I'm considering taking a break from them.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's completely understandable that you don't want to be reminded of your Uncle through a nickname that holds painful memories. It's your right to choose how you want to be referred to, and it's not too much to ask for your family to respect your wishes. You don't have to compromise on this. If they continue to call you Ladybug, it might be time to have a more serious conversation with them about how their actions are affecting you.
2. **SarcasticSally**: OP, I'm so sorry for your loss. It's really not fair that your family is pushing you to keep using a nickname that's clearly painful for you. You have every right to be known as Ellie, and it's not too much to ask for your family to respect your wishes. If they continue to call you Ladybug, it might be time to set some boundaries. You don't have to take this lying down.
3. **ConcernedCousin**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I can understand why you wouldn't want to be called Ladybug anymore. It's a special nickname that you shared with your Uncle, and it's natural that you wouldn't want to be reminded of him through it. I think it's great that you're standing up for yourself and wanting to be known as Ellie. I hope your family can understand where you're coming from and respect your wishes.
4. **FrustratedFamilyMember**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I can understand why you wouldn't want to be called Ladybug anymore, but I have to say that I'm a little frustrated that you're not willing to compromise on this. It's not like we're trying to be hurtful or anything. We just want to keep your Uncle's memory alive. Can't you just try to find a way to make it work? Maybe we can come up with a new nickname that you're comfortable with?
5. **SupportiveSister**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I can understand why you wouldn't want to be called Ladybug anymore. It's a special nickname that you shared with your Uncle, and it's natural that you wouldn't want to be reminded of him through it. I think it's great that you're standing up for yourself and wanting to be known as Ellie. I'm on your side, OP. I think it's time for us to respect your wishes and start calling you Ellie. Sorry if we've been insensitive. We didn't mean to hurt you.

TITLE: My [27 M] GF [25 F] of 3 years just told me she has problems with sex because of past relationships

POST: My girlfriend and I have been sleeping together since the beginning of our relationship, and recently I've started trying to gently introduce more in the bedroom. she's always had a toy, but i've been trying to introduce more positions and experiences to make things a little more fun.

the other day we started fooling around and she abdruptly stopped me saying she didn't like anything I was doing (same thing I always do), she doesn't like making out, and she doesn't want anything new. She completely shut down and wouldn't say another word to me after this.

the next day she text me saying that she's had "really terrible relationships, including really scary sex" and that "she has a problems with sex because of past relationships"

I'm not sure where to go from here, she won't talk about it, I also now have no idea what she wants in bed (she says normal sex is all she wants). Ideally I'd like for her to heal in some way and open up with me. Should we stop having sex all together for a while? I could suggest her see a therapist but I imagine that not going well.

TL;DR: GF of 3 years has problems with sex due to past relationships, won't talk about it, and I'm unsure how to proceed.

---

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's not ready to talk about it yet. Maybe give her some space and let her know that you're there for her when she's ready to open up. You can also try asking her what she's comfortable with and what she's not, without pushing her to talk about the past."
* "I think it's great that you're trying to understand her perspective. However, it's also important to prioritize your own needs and desires. If you're not getting what you need from the relationship, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what you're looking for."
* "I think it's a good idea to suggest therapy. A professional can help her work through her issues and provide a safe and non-judgmental space for her to open up. You can also offer to go with her to the sessions, which might help her feel more comfortable."
* "It's possible that she's not ready to talk about it yet, but it's also possible that she's not willing to work on her issues. If she's not willing to open up and work on her problems, it might be worth reevaluating the relationship and considering whether it's healthy for you to stay in it."
* "I think it's great that you're trying to be understanding and supportive. However, it's also important to remember that you can't fix her problems or make her feel better. You can only support her and be there for her as she works through her issues. Try not to take it personally and focus on being a good partner to her."

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my ExGF [21 F] were together 5 Months, Dez. last year we broke up, now she texts me one day before Valentines Day

POST: Hey Reddit,

First of all, i want to excuse myself for any grammatical mistakes iam 

goin to do here, english is not my motherlanguage :D.

Since my ex gf and I broke up in Dezember (She tought we dont fit 

together... i thought the opposite thing... but okay..)

we had no contact, no calls, no messages,..

And today out of nothing my ex gf send me a picture she took, with a

cat who has a mustache. "Like a sir^^, i had to think of you when i saw

this ", she wrote.

After that we had a little smalltalk, until she wrote she is out right now 

and wishes me a good night.

Do you think she send me the picture on purpose? Does she want that 

i make a move? I mean today is one day before valentines day.. I dont 

understand very much of women,but i think when a women does 

something like that, she would do this on purpose and not just out of the blue? 

Am i right on this?

PLZ HELP ME :/

TL;DR: ExGF sends me a picture of a cat with a mustache on the day before Valentines Day, after 5 months of no contact. Do you think she wants me to make a move?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, it's definitely a sign that she's still got feelings for you. The cat with a mustache is a pretty clear hint. Don't overthink it, just respond with a simple "Hey, thanks for thinking of me" and see where it goes.
2. **SarcasticSally**: Oh boy, you're really overanalyzing this. It's just a cat with a mustache, dude. She might have just seen it and thought of you. Don't read too much into it. Just chill and don't make a big deal out of it.
3. **RelationshipRookie**: I think you're right to be cautious, OP. It's been 5 months since you broke up, and she's only reaching out now, on the day before Valentine's Day. That's a pretty obvious attempt to get your attention. Don't get your hopes up just yet, but it's definitely worth exploring.
4. **ExperiencedEx**: I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's usually a mix of both. She might genuinely be thinking of you, but she's also probably trying to get your attention. Don't respond right away, take some time to think about it, and then respond with a casual "Hey, how's it going?" or something like that.
5. **Redditor99**: I think you're being too paranoid, OP. It's just a cat with a mustache, for crying out loud! Don't overanalyze it. Just respond with a simple "Haha, that's funny" and move on. Don't make a big deal out of it.

**OP's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I think I'll take the advice of throwaway123456 and respond with a simple "Hey, thanks for thinking of me". I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes!

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in online dating and relationships, where an ex-partner reaches out after a significant amount of time has passed, often with a seemingly innocuous message or gesture. The OP is unsure of what to make of this sudden contact and is seeking advice from the Reddit community. The comments range from cautionary advice to more optimistic views, highlighting the complexities of human relationships and the importance of communication and boundaries.

TITLE: I [19 M] am finding that when I meet a girl, I get turned off if I find out that they are in a sorority

POST: So I'm in college and trying to meet as many people as possible.  For some reason, I tend to immediately get turned off if I find out that a girl is in a sorority.  I am personally not the most social person and don't really like going out to many parties, but that is exactly what a lot of these girls love to do.  

Specifically, there is this girl in one of my classes that I like and we get along really well, but she's in a sorority.  Let's say, for example, we started to date. I don't know how comfortable I would be knowing that she would be at these party's, while she, and many other guys, would be drunk. 

Is it in my best interest to not pursue girls who are in a sorority? Or do I have a false sense of what some of these frat and sorority parties are like and give it a shot?

TL;DR: I'm 19 and find out that girls in sororities are often into partying, which makes me uncomfortable. Should I avoid dating girls in sororities or give it a shot?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not about the sorority itself, but about the type of people who are often drawn to them. If you're not comfortable with the party scene, it's probably best to avoid dating someone who is heavily involved in it. But don't generalize all sorority girls as being the same, there are plenty of exceptions." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I'm a sorority girl and I can tell you that not all of us are party animals. We have a variety of interests and hobbies, just like anyone else. Maybe try getting to know her as a person and not make assumptions about her based on her sorority affiliation." (u/sororitygirl123)
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with yourself about what makes you uncomfortable. If you're not comfortable with the party scene, it's okay to prioritize that. But don't let your discomfort dictate your entire dating life. There are plenty of girls out there who don't participate in the party scene, sorority or not." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I'm a guy who's been in a relationship with a sorority girl and it's been amazing. We balance each other out, she's not into the party scene as much as her friends, and we have a great time together. Don't let your preconceived notions scare you off, give it a shot and get to know her as an individual." (u/sororityboy)

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are mixed, with some people advising the OP to avoid dating sorority girls due to their partying habits, while others suggest that not all sorority girls are the same and that it's possible to find someone who doesn't fit the stereotype. The OP is encouraged to prioritize their own comfort and not let their discomfort dictate their entire dating life. Ultimately, the decision to pursue a relationship with a sorority girl depends on the individual's preferences and values.

TITLE: I [27M] have been the lover of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder [26F]. Recently recognized all her symptoms of BPD so I need advice, possibly from those who have been in a similar situations.

POST: For the last year, I have been in a very sexual relationship with this girl in whom I now see the symptoms of BPD. She's got a boyfriend and while I'm relatively open with my relationships, she gets extremely jealous. There were a couple of times where she tried to blame me for some problem that I really couldn't see myself at fault for. And then possibly as a revenge measure for me not giving a crap, she goes rebounding with some other guy (not even her bf). However after that in her calm episode, she regretted doing that on an impulse and even accepted that she might have BPD after we had a talk.

So now here's my problem. I'm a student of human behavior and after observing her behavioral patterns, researched a lot on BPD and Histrionic Personality Disorder. There were a few AMAs on Reddit as well and majority say to get out of there and cut all contact. Most of the guys there seemed to have been in serious relationships with the women in those instances. I'm in it for the amazing sex but people say that the manipulation will start setting in. I've already noticed that I've been investing more time with her over the last few months. 

She's agreed to treatment so should I bother being a support figure for her since she's got a bf anyway? Or continue with the sexytimes til things get crazier?

TL;DR: I'm in a sexual relationship with someone who has BPD symptoms. She's agreed to treatment, but I'm unsure if I should continue the relationship or cut ties. Advice from those who have been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.

REPLIES:

* "I'm not a professional, but I've been in a similar situation. I would advise you to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. While it's great that she's agreed to treatment, BPD is a complex condition that requires a lot of work and dedication from both parties. You deserve to be in a healthy, balanced relationship where you can grow and thrive together. If you're only in it for the sex, then it's probably not worth the emotional toll it could take on you. Consider setting boundaries and seeing if she's willing to work on the relationship with you."
* "I've been in a relationship with someone with BPD and it was a nightmare. I would advise you to get out of there as soon as possible. The manipulation and emotional abuse will only get worse if you stay. You deserve better than to be treated like a doormat. Don't get me wrong, I know it's hard to walk away, but trust me, it's the best decision you'll ever make."
* "I've been in a similar situation and I would advise you to take a step back and assess the situation. While it's great that she's agreed to treatment, you need to consider whether you're ready to take on the emotional baggage that comes with being in a relationship with someone with BPD. It's not easy, and it's not always possible to 'fix' someone with BPD. You need to think about what you want and what you're willing to tolerate. If you're only in it for the sex, then it's probably not worth the emotional toll it could take on you."
* "I've been in a relationship with someone with BPD and it was a rollercoaster ride. I would advise you to get out of there as soon as possible. The emotional abuse and manipulation will only get worse if you stay. You deserve better than to be treated like a doormat. Don't get me wrong, I know it's hard to walk away, but trust me, it's the best decision you'll ever make."
* "I've been in a similar situation and I would advise you to take a step back and assess the situation.

Overall, the majority of the responses advise the OP to take a step back and re-evaluate their priorities, considering the potential emotional toll of being in a relationship with someone with BPD. Some respondents share their own personal experiences and warn the OP about the potential for emotional abuse and manipulation. Others suggest that the OP should consider setting boundaries and seeing if the person with BPD is willing to work on the relationship. However, there is no consensus on whether the OP should continue the relationship or cut ties. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP to make, but it is clear that the respondents are concerned about the potential negative impact of the relationship on the OP's well-being.

TITLE: My [27 M] long distance gf [24 F] is hanging with her ex [23 M]

POST: We have known each other for a year, dating for 6 months.

My girlfriend moved back to her hometown 4 months ago, where her ex, who she dated for 5 years, also lives. We have been doing the long distance thing as best we can and I have even scheduled a trip out there.

I recently found out she is getting texts from her ex all day long and even goes and hangs out with him. She and I talked about it and she assured me she doesn't like him anymore, but considers him a dear friend. She says that she is not interested in him, but she doesn't want to rock the boat and tell him to stop.

I do not like this one bit. I of course do not want to giver an ultimatum, but I have tried saying I do not like it and she does not seem to get it only to tell me I have nothing to worry about. At this point I want to cancel the trip and say goodbye.

My question: Am I overreacting and need to grow up and get over it or should I just put an end to all of this drama and end it?

TL;DR: Long distance girlfriend is hanging out with her ex, who she dated for 5 years, and I don't like it. She says it's just friendship, but I'm worried about the potential for something more. Should I just end it or try to work through it?

**Comments:**

* "You're not overreacting. It's understandable that you're feeling insecure and worried about the potential for something more. You deserve better than to be in a situation where you're constantly wondering if your girlfriend is still interested in her ex. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see if you can come to a compromise. If not, it might be best to end the relationship."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. Just because she's hanging out with her ex doesn't mean she's interested in him romantically. Maybe she's just trying to maintain a friendship for the sake of closure or to avoid awkwardness. If you're really that uncomfortable, maybe you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't jump to conclusions or assume the worst."
* "I agree with OP. If she's not interested in him romantically, then why is she still in contact with him? It's not like they're just friends. There's always a chance for something to spark again, and even if it doesn't, it's still a distraction from your relationship. I think OP should end it and focus on finding someone who is fully committed to him."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive. Just because she's hanging out with her ex doesn't mean she's not committed to you. Maybe she's just trying to maintain a connection with someone from her past. If you're really that uncomfortable, maybe you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't assume the worst or try to control her."
* "I think OP should take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If she's not willing to cut ties with her ex, then maybe she's not fully committed to OP. It's not about being possessive, it's about being in a relationship where both parties are fully invested. If that's not the case, then maybe it's time to move on." 

**Conclusion:** The comments are divided, with some people agreeing that the OP has a right to feel insecure and worried about the situation, while others think he's being too possessive or dramatic. Some people suggest having an open and honest conversation with the girlfriend about his feelings, while others think it's best to end the relationship if she's not willing to cut ties with her ex. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and what he feels is best for his relationship.

TITLE: Me [31F] with my Husband [38 M] 12 years/4 Married, Talking about divorce. Outside of infidelity, why did you get divorce?

POST: My husband and I have been lightly talking about divorce for a while now but it looks like I may be going through with it soon. 
**Details:**
Met in college. He worked the same job until we moved out of the country for 2 years after I got laid off. I've always earned more money, paid more for things, until we lived out of the country- he earned more money. I stayed at home, had baby. We're back in the states- hes getting degree and we're planning on going back overseas with his new degree so he can earn more money. He's now studying and I'm the only one working. I came back 5 months before him to try and get settled first. So we spent that time apart. He came back in Jan. 14.

We have a 19 month old and are currently under a lot of financial stress (I'm filing chapter 7 soon, 1 income), he is trying to start a new career (teacher) and we are living with my parents and teenage brother. We have little privacy and very little time to ourselves, with or without the baby. We sleep in separate beds often because of the baby and we barely have sex (maybe once every 3 months), we're both faithful however.

 So all these are all factors...but this weekend after letting him go out to meet with a lady that he met at a teachers thing and hang out with her at an art museum all day he came home with a migraine so I let him rest. This morning we go out for brunch and he's a complete asshole to me because I don't want him to rush our brunch/mess up my semi-planned day so he can go meet up with one of his students (male) and he mentions divorce again while in the car. This triggers me to get pissed and actually go online and look into filing. 
It's hard to actually pull the trigger. I'm trying to figure out if it's the circumstancel that we're in (which is temporary but taking longer then planned) or if it's really just over. 

I'd just like to know what to do- How to figure out if this marriage is over or not.

TL;DR: 12 years together, 4 years married, talking about divorce due to financial stress, lack of intimacy, and husband's recent behavior (meeting up with a lady at an art museum). I'm trying to figure out if it's just the circumstances or if it's really over.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and trapped. It's understandable that you're considering divorce. Have you talked to a therapist or counselor about your feelings? Sometimes it can be helpful to have an outside perspective to help you work through your emotions and figure out what you really want."
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your marriage and consider what you want. It's not always easy to make decisions like this, but it's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Have you considered couples therapy? It might be helpful to work through some of the issues you're facing together."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about what to do. I think it's great that you're taking the time to think about your feelings and consider what you want. It's not always easy to make decisions like this, but it's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

TITLE: Really like a great guy with herpes. What should I do?

POST: Hi girls. Need some advice and never been in this position that I know of before. We've hung out for almost a month now. Never been sexual besides some kissing and light touching and he just recently told me he has had herpes for a while and for him it is very manageable. I could tell it was very hard for him to tell me. He is a big strong guy and had tears in his eyes telling me. He said he isn't on meds but he'd b willing to for sure. 

He seems like such a great guy, he has a good job, is very attractive and we click so well. We are both in our late 20s. What should I do? I know the worst part of this disease appears to be the stigma and like one in five people

Or so have it. I am scared to let him walk but obviously I don't want herpes myself. I just know if he didn't have this condition we could really be something. We have a ton of common interests and he seems to have a lot going for him. But I don't know what to do.  Any advice???

TL;DR: I really like a guy who has herpes. He's a great guy, but I'm scared of getting it. What should I do?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not about the herpes itself, it's about the emotional toll it can take on a relationship. If he's willing to work with you and be open about it, that's a good sign. But you need to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns and boundaries. Make sure you're comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with someone who has herpes."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Girl, you're not going to get herpes from kissing and light touching. It's not like he's going to spit in your face or something. If you're really concerned, you can get tested and then have a conversation about it. But honestly, it's not the end of the world. It's just a virus."
3. **u/healthyliving**: "I have herpes and I'm in a happy, healthy relationship. It's not the end of the world, and it's definitely not a reflection of the person's character. If you're really concerned, you can get tested and then have a conversation about it. But don't let fear hold you back from getting to know someone who seems like a great guy."
4. **u/realistic_rachel**: "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, herpes is a big deal. It's not just a minor inconvenience. But if you're really interested in this guy, you need to have an open and honest conversation about it. Make sure you're comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with someone who has herpes, and make sure he's willing to work with you to manage it. It's not going to be easy, but if you're both willing to put in the effort, it could work out."
5. **u/anonymous_anon**: "I have herpes and I've been in relationships with people who have it too. It's not the end of the world, and it's definitely not a reflection of the person's character. If you're really concerned, you can get tested and then have a conversation about it. But don't let fear hold you back from getting to know someone who seems like a great guy." (Note: This comment is likely from someone who has herpes and is trying to offer a personal perspective.)

TITLE: I (17m) don't know what to do about a pretty good friend (16f), of about 2 years, who's drifting away. Nothing romantic.

POST: So I have a group of friends from a couple of schools who have formed around a few peoples friendships, basically hipsters and nerds, who just kind of ended up hanging around each other a bit, sharing a lot of interests, etc.

Anyway my friend came into the group kind of latish and is always saying that she feels separate, coming from a completely different school from everyone else and says she recently got very socially awkward.

She had drifted away for almost a year and I hadn't seen her for months and months so I decided to message her a few times and just see how she was doing, if she wanted to keep talking or what.

I helped her through some stuff as well as I could and she seemed to appreciate it. We kept talking and she annoyed me a few times, a combination of me having a couple of bad days and her being a bit stand offish. One of these times I unloaded a tonne of my issues onto her, basically telling her to fuck off and get off my back in a polite way. She messaged back very contritely and said she was always there for me.

Yet it doesn't seem like she is, she rarely starts conversations with me, about twice in the last 3 months and I just don't think she actually cares for me despite everything she says. Actions are worth more than words right? So currently, I've decided to stop talking to her. If she wants to talk to me, great. Otherwise as I'm the only one from the group she was talking to recently, after my 18th birthday party which I will invite her to because I've already said so, that'll be it for our friendship. Am I doi.g the right thing? I haven't really talked to her about this because I dont wanna be really needy and should I have to talk to her about it when she's ignored my problems other times?

TL;DR: Friend of 2 years, 16f, drifting away, I've tried to help her through stuff, she's been stand-offish, I've unloaded on her, she apologized, but actions speak louder than words. I've stopped talking to her, if she wants to talk, great, otherwise, that's it.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being a bit harsh. You're giving her an ultimatum and expecting her to magically start caring more. Maybe she's just not as invested in the friendship as you are. Have you tried talking to her about how you're feeling instead of just cutting her off?" (123 upvotes)
* "I'm with OP. If someone says they're always there for you and then doesn't follow through, it's not a healthy friendship. OP has every right to set boundaries and prioritize their own emotional well-being." (56 upvotes)
* "OP, have you considered that maybe she's going through some personal stuff and that's why she's been distant? Maybe she's not ignoring you on purpose. Try to be more understanding and patient. You never know what someone else is going through." (34 upvotes)
* "I think OP is being a bit too quick to write her off. Maybe she's just not as good at initiating conversations as OP is. Maybe OP should try to initiate conversations more often instead of waiting for her to do it. Communication is a two-way street." (21 upvotes)
* "OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on what she's not doing. Instead of expecting her to be more invested in the friendship, try to think about what you can do to make the friendship more fulfilling for both of you. Maybe there's something specific you can do to show her you care." (15 upvotes)

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thanks for all the comments, guys. I think I was being a bit harsh and I can see how my ultimatum might come across as unfair. I think I'll try to have a conversation with her about how I'm feeling instead of just cutting her off. Maybe we can work through some of the issues and come out stronger on the other side. Thanks for the advice and perspective!" (123 upvotes)

TITLE: Me [25/F] with my fiance [25 M], tells me he's not sure if we should get married-wedding in less than 4 months.

POST: We met in college and have been together for 6 years. Last summer we got engaged and we're planning a wedding for this coming summer. There have been a few ups and downs in our relationship- mainly I have an issue with him drinking and cheating on me in the past (it happened twice). He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me. I encouraged him to seek counseling instead of drinking and he did for a while, but then stopped. Also the cheating was very early on in the relationship and then once last year. He was extremely tearful and apologetic, so I (maybe naively?) forgave him.

So, fast forward to now. Things have been really great or so I've thought. He hasn't drank in at least 8 months and has been really taking care of his health. Until tonight I thought we were really happy. I was woken up to him being loud on the phone and I got up to ask him to be quiet. When I saw him I knew instantly he was drunk. We got in an argument and I shut down and left the room crying. He followed me and by this time he was also crying and saying he just "didn't think he could do it anymore." And that he's not sure if it's the right thing to do. I asked why  and basically he said because he's never seen a successful marriage (true) and that "someone better might come along." 

I am so heart broken. Obviously I know this conversation shouldn't have happened like that and in his state, but it did and now I don't know what to do. Is there any hope in this at all?

TL;DR: Fiance of 6 years, engaged for 9 months, says he's not sure if we should get married due to past issues with drinking and cheating. He's been doing well for 8 months, but got drunk and had a relapse. I'm heartbroken and unsure what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like your fiancé has some deep-seated issues that need to be addressed. Have you considered couples therapy to work through these issues together? It might be a good idea to take a step back and re-evaluate whether you're ready to get married, especially given the short timeline.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think you need to have a serious talk with your fiancé about his concerns and what he's willing to work on to overcome his issues. It's not fair to you to have to deal with his relapses and uncertainty. You deserve someone who is committed to your relationship and willing to work through challenges together. Consider taking some time apart to reflect on whether this is the right relationship for you.
3. **u/heartbroken**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your fiancé has some serious trust issues that need to be addressed. Have you considered setting boundaries around his drinking and behavior? It might be helpful to have a conversation about what you're willing and not willing to tolerate in the relationship.
4. **u/realisticviews**: OP, I think you need to be realistic about your fiancé's past behavior and the fact that he's had relapses. It's not just about the drinking and cheating, but also about his lack of commitment to your relationship and his uncertainty about the future. You deserve someone who is all-in and willing to work through challenges together. Consider taking some time apart to reflect on whether this is the right relationship for you.

**Original Poster's Response:**

TITLE: Today, I told a story about something that happened a long time ago, then talked to my brother about it and found out I wasn't actually there. Now I feel crazy guilty and may have overreacted.

POST: I remember an event from my childhood with immense clarity. I saw an AskReddit about something similar today, and I told the whole story. What happened, how I was involved, how it felt, and how it ended up. I told them a fantastic story, one I'd never really gotten to tell before.

I talked to my brother about it later. He got confused and informed me that I wasn't even there. I'd apparently overheard my parents talking about what had happened and dreamed about it. Then I assumed that dream was what really happened.

I freaked out and logged back onto Reddit, only to find someone had figured out where it had happened. In a panic, I deleted my story of it altogether, and then deleted my account for good measure. I didn't want to get karma for it, and I didn't want that information out there.

TL;DR: I told a story about a childhood event, then found out I wasn't actually there. I feel guilty and overreacted by deleting my account.

TITLE: [18/m] I love a girl (19/f), but I'm in an atypical friendzone. Go for it or don't risk ruining the friendship?

POST: She's amazing. Funny, super cute. She likes me, a lot, and we have a lot of physical contact. The problem is her family is super-Christian, and she, while not a fanatic, is very religious. I'm an atheist. It doesn't really bother her, and her religion doesn't really bother me. But it has restricted the bounds of our relationship.

We talked about the possibility of dating, and the way she sees it is that the relationship will never go very far, i.e. marriage. Not that she wants to go into a relationship only if she thinks she'll marry, but that she thinks that we can never break that barrier. She agrees that we'd be great together, and that we might date for years, but that eventually she KNOWS we would never go further than that.

My opinion is that we should take the happiness while we can get it. She doesn't want to go into a relationship knowing it will end, which seems pessimistic and a little illogical to me. Love is about risk, and in my opinion you go for it and if it hurts in the end, the happiness was worth it.

I think that she thinks we're done talking about it, but I'm thinking about bringing it up again. Should I risk losing her friendship, which I don't really think would happen, but would be awful, in order to state my argument better?

Additionally, I'm totally not good enough for her.

TL;DR: I'm in an atypical friendzone with a girl who's amazing, but her family is super-Christian and she's very religious. We've talked about dating, but she thinks it'll never go further than a casual relationship. I think we should take the happiness while we can get it, but I'm worried about losing her friendship if I bring it up again.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. It's better to be upfront and risk losing the friendship than to keep your feelings bottled up and potentially resent her for not pursuing a relationship with you."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's better to be honest and take the risk of losing the friendship than to keep your feelings hidden and potentially regret it later."
* "I think you should consider the fact that she's very religious and her family is super-Christian. It's possible that she's not comfortable with the idea of dating someone who doesn't share her beliefs. You might want to consider whether you're willing to compromise on your beliefs for the sake of the relationship."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship with her? Take some time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to compromise on."
* "I think you should focus on building a stronger connection with her as friends before trying to pursue a romantic relationship. Sometimes, people need time to develop feelings for each other, and focusing on the friendship could help you build a stronger bond."
* "I think you should be honest with yourself about whether you're willing to compromise on your beliefs for the sake of the relationship. If you're not willing to compromise, then it might be better to focus on building a stronger connection with her as friends rather than pursuing a romantic relationship."
* "I think you should consider the fact that she's 19 and you're 18. It's possible that she's not emotionally ready for a serious relationship, and it might be better to focus on building a stronger connection with her as friends rather than pursuing a romantic relationship."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship with her? Take some time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to compromise on." (This comment is similar to the one above, but with a slightly different wording.)

**Note:** The comments are a mix of opinions, with some people advising the OP to be honest and take the risk of losing the friendship, while others suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating the feelings or focusing on building a stronger connection as friends. Some comments also consider the religious differences and the age gap between the OP and the girl. Overall, the comments provide a range of perspectives and advice for the OP to consider.

TITLE: after a year my [19/F] druze boyfriend [21/M] won't/can't tell his parents about me, and tells me we can't have a future, what should i do?

POST: already posted but im looking for more advice.

I am a non druze female who was in a relationship with a druze male, we dated for a year and for both of us it was our first love. Even though we're still young it truly feels like he's it for me and vice versa. However, recently we hit a crossroad and he decided to end things. Since in Druze culture you are unable to marry out of the culture and if you do you are no longer considered a druze, and then you and your family are looked down on and shunned in the community. However, some people i talk to say in druze culture it's different for guys and it may be acceptable for them to marry someone outside the culture. He doesn't really follow his religon/culture, he's just scared of how it'll affect his parents, he says he can't loose them or let them down. He doesn't want them to die unhappy, feeling like they failed. I really dont think they'd completely disown him, and i think he knows that, he just wants them to die content and they apparently can't if hes with someone outside the culture. But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing. But by being appart its destroying the both of us, im unable to move on and let go of him, i just can't give up hope. And he is regretting his choice everyday, but he's so torn. He tells me "maybe one day we can be together but i can't bank on that" which makes me feel like him and i can be, i can't let go.. I feel like hes just scared and he always stresses about the future, so maybe he's just having a quater life crisis? Any help of what we should do? id really appriciate it, i dont think ill ever be able to get over him.

TL;DR: I'm a 19/F who's been dating a 21/M Druze guy for a year. He won't/can't tell his parents about me because of Druze cultural restrictions. He says we can't have a future together because of this. He's torn between following his parents' wishes and being happy with me. He's regretting his choice and is unsure about the future. I'm struggling to move on and let go of him. What should I do?

ADVICE FROM REDDITORS:

* "It sounds like he's stuck in a cycle of fear and uncertainty. You deserve someone who is willing to take a chance on you and your relationship. It's okay to move on and find someone who is more open-minded and willing to take risks."
* "It's not about being scared or having a quarter-life crisis, it's about his parents' expectations and his own sense of identity. You can't force him to make a decision, but you can't stay stuck in limbo either. You deserve to be with someone who is willing to take a chance on you."
* "It's not about the culture, it's about his own fears and insecurities. He's using the culture as an excuse to avoid dealing with his own emotions. You deserve someone who is willing to face their fears and take a chance on you."
* "You can't change his mind or make him do something he's not ready to do. You can only control your own actions and emotions. Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness."
* "It's okay to be sad and hurt, but don't give up on yourself. You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are. Keep moving forward and don't look back."
* "It's not about being 'right' or 'wrong', it's about being true to yourself and your feelings. You deserve someone who is willing to take a chance on you and your relationship."
* "You can't force him to make a decision, but you can't stay stuck in limbo either. You deserve to be with someone who is willing to take a chance on you. Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness."
* "It's not about the culture, it's about his own fears and insecurities. He's using the culture as an excuse to avoid dealing with his own emotions. You deserve someone who is willing to face their fears and take a chance on you."
* "You can't change his mind or make him do something he's not ready to do. You can only control your own actions and emotions. Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness."
* "It's okay to be sad and hurt, but don't give up on yourself. You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are. Keep moving forward and don't look back."

TITLE: [24M] my girlfriend [25F] of 1 year, doesnt trust me anymore

POST: I've screwed up. 

I've been going out with her about a year and we have lived together about 6 months.

I've told my girlfriend a few times that I would be home by a certain time on nights out by myself and for various reasons ended up being home much later.

It's happened a few times now and each time she gets more and more angry. 

The first time I just stayed out because I was really drunk and I forgot what I'd told her. When I came home she was really upset and after a few days we made up and I promised to not let it happen again.

Then a few nights ago I went out on my own, told her I'd be home by 1am.

She was skeptical but I was adamant that she could trust me and I wouldn't do what I did last time.

But I ended up getting lost, couldn't find the right bus (we're very low on money), then had to wait over an hour for a cab, and ended up getting home at 4am.

Now she says she'll never believe a promise I make etc and she thinks I just went out to a club and didn't give a shit about her etc.

I can't prove that I couldn't get home and I can see why it looks like what she thinks (that I just said fuck it and went out till 4am and took a cab home), even though I know it's not true.

She's now not talking to me, and last time she was this upset we almost broke up.

How can I fix this?

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't trust me anymore because I've broken promises about coming home on time. I know it looks bad, but I didn't mean to and I'm willing to work on it. How can I fix this?

---

**Comments:**

* "You need to have a real conversation with her about what happened. Explain the situation and apologize for your mistakes. It's not about justifying what you did, but about showing her that you're willing to learn from your mistakes and work on your communication."
* "It sounds like you're not taking her feelings seriously. You need to acknowledge that your actions have hurt her and that you're willing to do better. It's not just about 'fixing' the situation, but about building trust and respect in your relationship."
* "Have you considered getting a GPS tracker or a phone app that can help you stay on schedule? It might help alleviate some of the anxiety and mistrust."
* "You need to take responsibility for your actions and own up to your mistakes. Stop making excuses and just apologize. You can't control how she feels, but you can control how you respond to the situation."
* "It's not just about the promises you broke, it's about the fact that you didn't communicate with her about what was going on. You need to work on being more open and honest with her about your plans and whereabouts."
* "You need to have a conversation with her about what you're willing to do to regain her trust. It's not just about saying sorry, it's about showing her that you're committed to changing your behavior and being more responsible."

TITLE: Tifu by leaving a shit storm

POST: So I have been working at a restaurant known as Jimmy John's for the past 3 years. 2.5 of them being a manager.  For those who don't work at jj we get a visit from corporate once about every 4 to 6 weeks. The guys was a little late in coming but we had been preparing for him for the past week. Last night I had the luxury of closing with a new guy and a worker we hired about a month ago. I can usually close the store and get out around 945 with it looking good. Well last night having a new guy and having to do double the work we didn't get out till nearly 1030. I thought it looked good but I would come to find out the next morning that wasn't the case. I go in to pick up my phone charger and the look in the assistant managers eye could kill.  I thought he was going to break down and cry.  I then find out we got a low 80. Now I don't know what to do. I could have very well just cost everyone a 750$ bonus.

TL;DR: I'm a manager at Jimmy John's and I just got back from a corporate visit. I was supposed to close the store and get out by 9:45, but we didn't get out till 10:30 due to a new guy and extra work. I thought everything was fine, but the next morning I found out we got a low 80, which could cost everyone a $750 bonus.

---

This post is a great example of a "Tifu" (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author, a manager at Jimmy John's, is sharing their embarrassing and potentially costly mistake. They had been preparing for a corporate visit and thought they had everything under control, but due to a new employee and extra work, they didn't get out of the store until 10:30 PM, which is much later than usual.

The author is worried that their mistake could cost everyone a $750 bonus, which is a significant amount of money. They're sharing their story on the subreddit to get advice and support from others who may have been in similar situations.

The post is relatable and engaging, and the author's honesty and vulnerability make it easy for readers to sympathize with them. The story is also a great example of how even experienced professionals can make mistakes, and how important it is to learn from them and move forward.

TITLE: F(23)-Feeling hopeless.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 4 years now, we have lived together for close to 2, and I feel like I have let myself go. When we first met, I was 20 pounds lighter and nearly never left the house without making sure I looked good. I took pride in the way I looked, now I hardly even wear makeup and even though my boyfriend loves me and constantly tells me how beautiful I am, I feel like I've let myself go and have no idea how to find the motivation to get back to finding myself again. I need help...I'm scared one day he will wake up and realize I'm not the fit, pretty girl he fell in love with.

TL;DR: I've let myself go physically and emotionally, feeling hopeless and scared my boyfriend will leave me because I'm not the same person he fell in love with.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, you're not alone in feeling this way. It's normal to go through phases where you feel like you've lost your identity or let yourself go. The important thing is that you're acknowledging these feelings and wanting to make a change. Have you considered talking to your boyfriend about how you're feeling? He might be more supportive than you think.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I went through a similar phase in my relationship where I felt like I'd lost my spark. What helped me was setting small goals for myself, like taking a walk every day or trying a new recipe. It's not about becoming the person you were 4 years ago, but about finding a new sense of purpose and confidence. Have you tried doing something that brings you joy and makes you feel good about yourself?
3. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: OP, I think it's amazing that you're recognizing your feelings and wanting to make a change. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not happy with ourselves. I would recommend seeking professional help, whether it's a therapist or a counselor. They can help you work through these feelings and develop a plan to get you back on track. Remember, you're not alone in this.
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Your boyfriend loves you for who you are, not for some idealized version of yourself. If he's constantly telling you how beautiful you are, that's because he sees the beauty in you, not just your physical appearance. Try to focus on the things that make you happy and fulfilled, rather than trying to fit some arbitrary standard of beauty.

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post offer a range of advice and support, from acknowledging the normalcy of feeling lost and wanting to make a change, to setting small goals and seeking professional help. The most important takeaway is that the OP is not alone in feeling this way and that there are people who care and want to help. The post also highlights the importance of self-acceptance and self-love, and the need to focus on what makes us happy and fulfilled rather than trying to fit an idealized standard of beauty.

TITLE: My (28f) boyfriend (28m) watched porn excessively and was caught. Now I keep looking at his phone and invading his privacy out of insecurity. What do I do? Help! NSFW

POST: Back story: we have been dating for 2 years. About a year and a half into our relationship I was checking his internet history just to find an old website with a recipe I made for dinner before. I usually don't mind my boyfriend watching porn. It's completely unrealistic to think guys don't fap. But I found out he had been messaging the girls on the subreddit complimenting them. I flipped out naturally because that was crossing the line. He said he was addicted to porn. He went to talk to a therapist who said he didn't need to be treated. I felt betrayed but still forgave him. 

Fast forward 6 months: I find myself constantly needing to check his phone and computer to see if he watches it still or messages girls. I feel more insecure than ever. He caught me looking on his phone history. I was honest and told him that I was looking to see if he still is watching porn in random moments like he used to. What do I do? I don't like being like this. I want to trust him. I'm scared he is going to keep on doing it behind my back. 

Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: I caught my boyfriend watching porn and messaging girls on the subreddit. He said he was addicted and went to therapy. I forgave him but now I find myself constantly checking his phone and computer out of insecurity. He caught me and I'm scared he'll keep doing it behind my back. Help!

COMMENTS:

* "You're not overreacting, you have every right to feel insecure after what he did. But you need to take a step back and think about why you're still checking his phone and computer. Is it because you're genuinely worried about his behavior or is it because you're trying to control him? You need to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries."
* "I think you're being unfair to your boyfriend. He's already admitted to his addiction and is seeking help. You need to focus on your own recovery from this betrayal and work on rebuilding trust. Stop checking his phone and computer and focus on communicating with him openly and honestly."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's natural to feel insecure after what happened. But you need to take a step back and think about what you're doing. You're not going to find any answers by constantly snooping on his phone and computer. You need to have a real conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries."
* "I think you're being too trusting. You need to set some boundaries and communicate with him about what you're comfortable with. You can't just forgive and forget. You need to have a real conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries."
* "I think you're being too controlling. You need to give your boyfriend some space and trust him to make his own decisions. You can't just constantly check his phone and computer. That's not healthy for your relationship."

This post and its comments highlight the complexities of relationships and the challenges of rebuilding trust after a betrayal. The OP is struggling with feelings of insecurity and is unsure of how to navigate the situation. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend to warning her against being too controlling or unfair. Ultimately, the OP needs to reflect on her own feelings and boundaries and work towards finding a solution that is healthy and respectful for both parties.

TITLE: Girl in friendship group [18/F] has randomly switched and friendzoned me[18/M] please help?

POST: I've recently started uni, had eyes on this girl from the start, we got talking, flirting, (to be fair she said right from the start she didn't want a relationship, I wasn't phased by that though I did want something exclusive) but then we began to meet up a couple times, we kissed, texted everyday flirting, etc. but all of a sudden she's now decided she wants to call things off, we're in the same friendship group but this didn't affect us at the start and I think were both mature enough to not let that affect anything. She wont deny liking me but says since she doesn't want a relationship she doesn't want to carry on with what were doing.
I had some bad news in the family recently and since I live away from them now I feel I sort of clung to her due to the affection she gave the past few days, I fear this has put her off.

-----Most people you ask will say I'm attractive, confident and funny - I do not mean to come across arrogant it's just to give you an insight to what I'm like! She is a nice girl, a virgin, by the way, not a player-----

The question is, I really like her and I don't want things to go that easily, how can I sway her views, and look to atleast get a date and maybe more from her? I really don't feel up for the friendzone... Do I need to make her jealous, if so how? Or at least, how do I recover?

TL;DR: Girl in friendship group has friendzoned me after we kissed, flirted, and had a connection. I'm 18, she's 18. I feel I've been led on and don't want to give up. Help me get her back or at least get a date from her.

TITLE: Whats your worst/best prank that back fired on you?

POST: I was in high school and went all year without getting in trouble. (First year since 2nd grade...suspended, detention, write up...). Well, on april fools, my first class i convenced my teacher to write me up for punching my sisters best friend in the face. My mother would have believed this since we did not get along at all. I had the teacher sign it, the principle and the school officer. I then received premission from the principle to go home early as if i was suspended. I called my mother 20 minutes after school started at told her i was suspended for fighting. Assuming my mother would pick me up and ground me for the day until i told her the truth after school was out (so i could sleep all day)....I was wrong. My mother called the police on me to arrest me for assult. I had to explain to the officers and my mother it was a joke. I was grounded for 3 weeks becuase of this.

TL;DR: I convinced my teacher to write me up for punching my sister's best friend in the face on April Fools' Day. I then got permission to go home early, but my mom didn't find it funny and called the police on me. I got grounded for 3 weeks.

---

This post is a great example of a prank gone wrong. The OP (original poster) thought they were being clever and funny, but it ended up causing more harm than good. The prank was meant to be a harmless joke, but it ended up being taken seriously by the OP's mother, who was understandably upset. The OP had to explain the situation to the police and their mother, which was embarrassing and frustrating.

The post is also a good example of how important it is to consider the consequences of one's actions, even if they are meant to be harmless. The OP's prank may have seemed funny to them at the time, but it ended up causing them to get in trouble and lose privileges. It's a good lesson to learn, and it's a funny and relatable story to share with others.

TITLE: Girl [19F] is mad at me [19M] because I posted a picture of a different girl to my Snapchat.

POST: All right. So this has a little backstory. The "friend" is someone I have been trying to date for the past month and a 1/2. She said yes to go out with me, but when I invite her out on a date, she says she wants to get to know me better before we jump in to anything.

Ok. I get that. We just start hanging out here and there. Get to know each other. I learn that she's had issues with her weight. It's a big problem for her. Not a problem for me. Fast forward to last Saturday (3/26), and she tells me that she's failing school and wants to focus on herself right now and isn't looking for a relationship. I was pretty broken up because it came out of nowhere and I thought things were going great.

I've still talked to her these past few days like nothing happened. Nothing relationship related, though. Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, "Bae" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways.

Last night, she sent me a snap that just said, "Wow." Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.

I asked a few of my friends about their opinion on the situation and they said she's just trying to control me. I just have no idea what I should do. Hell, I'm still confused and not sure how I really think about it.

TL;DR: Girl I've been trying to date for a month and a half is mad at me because I posted a picture of a different girl to my Snapchat. She captioned it "Bae" and it had a heart eyes emoji. We're not in a relationship, and I thought it was just a joke.

---

This post is a great example of how social media can be a source of conflict in relationships. The OP (original poster) is confused about why his "friend" is upset with him, and he's seeking advice from the Reddit community.

The situation is complex, and there are several factors at play. The OP's "friend" has been hesitant to commit to a relationship, and the OP has been trying to date her for a while. Meanwhile, the OP has been posting pictures of other girls on his Snapchat, which may be perceived as flirting or attention-seeking.

The OP's friend may feel that he's not taking their relationship seriously and is instead pursuing other options. The caption "Bae" and the heart eyes emoji may have been perceived as a declaration of affection or a signal that the OP is interested in someone else.

The OP's friends think that the girl is trying to control him, but it's possible that she's just feeling insecure or unsure about her own feelings. The OP may need to have a conversation with his "friend" to clear the air and understand her perspective.

In the meantime, the OP should probably take a step back and reevaluate his behavior on social media. Posting pictures of other girls, even if it's just a joke, may be perceived as insensitive or disrespectful to his "friend." He may want to consider being more mindful of his online behavior and avoiding situations that could be misinterpreted.

Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what he wants from his relationship with this girl. If he's not interested in pursuing a serious relationship with her, he may need to be honest with her about his feelings and move on. But if he's still interested in dating her, he'll need to have a conversation with her about his behavior and work to rebuild trust.

TITLE: [Serious] What value are men to women?

POST: This is a serious question, not a troll.  I've completed a stage of therapy, and my lesbian therapist has informed me I am not really lesbian or even that strongly bisexual, but instead I am emotionally unavailable.  She says I kept attracting gay and bisexual men because it was a way of telling and proving to myself I was open to dating men while also remaining safe.  She also said I tend to see relationships and men in very dire, pessimistic terms (she's correct), and am not yet open to seeing them positively.

Therapist wants to begin the next stage with me and calls it healing my emotional unavailability.  

I'm pretty scared and feel like it's worthless to even try.  Yep, I was completely over attracting gay guy after gay guy after mind game player after misogynist over psycho after headcase, but I feel "healing" this unavailability will just make me open to even worse exploitation.  So far I've experienced heterosexual men as brute, primitive, stupid, sex-obsessed oafs who prefer throwing a sports ball to interacting with women and see us only as dolls and toys -- or obsessive stalky maniacs who want to suffocate, smother and use women.  I know this is not healthy and not true.

If it's in you, Reddit, please in a serious, hopefully somewhat compassionate way list some ways heterosexual men are of value to heterosexual women.  I'll use these lists to work on my intellectual resistance to healing.  Right now I don't see any connection between women and men at all, I see no value whatsoever to men except as business partners and buddies, and I see marriage and other types of heterosexual relationships as women-exploitative.

(And yeah, I know you'll see the opposite as just as horrible, but please skip those kinds of answers right now.  I'll just use those as fuel to further hate men.)

Instead I want to see true ways men can be of value to women, so that when my resistance comes up in therapy over the next months I have a ready list I can confront my misandrist inner voice with.  For all compassionate, serious responses, REAL GRATITUDE.

TL;DR: I'm in therapy to overcome emotional unavailability and I'm scared of being open to men because I've only seen them as bad.  I want to know what value men can bring to women so I can confront my negative views in therapy.  Please help me with serious, compassionate answers.  No hate speech or "opposite" views, just genuine ways men can be of value to women.  Thank you.

TITLE: book about a cat that eats typewriter keys, shoelaces?

POST: I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms "cat", "typewriter", "shoelaces" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.  I can't believe this book isn't a hit that immediately pops up on Amazon or google.  I loved it enough to still be talking about it almost 30 years later.  My family thinks I'm crazy, but I don't think I'm even creative enough to make this up... 

Reddit, can you please help me find this book?

TL;DR: I'm looking for a children's book from the 80s about a cat that eats shoelaces and typewriter keys, and learns a lesson about moderation. The book has black and white illustrations and I remember the cat with shoelaces hanging out of its mouth. Help me find this book! 

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think I might have found it! The book that comes closest to what you're describing is 'The Shoelace Book' by Helen Ketteman. It's about a cat named Mr. Whiskers who eats shoelaces and gets bigger and bigger. The illustrations are black and white and pen-style. It's an old book, but it's still available on Amazon and eBay. It might not be the exact book you're looking for, but it's definitely similar. Give it a try and see if it's the one!"
2. **u/bookworm1984**: "I think I can help you with this! There's a book called 'The Greedy Cat' by Ursula Dubosarsky that features a cat that eats all sorts of things, including shoelaces and typewriter keys. The illustrations are black and white and the story teaches a lesson about moderation. It's an Australian book, but it's widely available online. Could this be the one you're looking for?"
3. **u/oldbookseller**: "I've seen this book before! It's a bit of a rare find, but I think I can help you track it down. Can you tell me more about the illustrations? Were they simple line drawings or more detailed? And do you remember any specific scenes or quotes from the book? The more details you can provide, the better I'll be able to help you find it."

**Other comments:**

* **u/catlover123**: "I love this story! I had a similar book as a kid and it was one of my favorites. I think it's great that you're still thinking about it after all these years."
* **u/bookcollector**: "I've been collecting children's books for years and I've never seen one like this. I'd love to get my hands on it and add it to my collection."
* **u/rememberwhen**: "I had a similar book as a kid and it was one of my favorite stories. I think it's great that you're still thinking about it after all these years. It's amazing how some books can stick with us like that."

The OP's post sparked a lively discussion on Reddit, with several users offering potential solutions to help find the book. The top comments provided specific book titles and authors that matched the OP's description, while other users offered additional suggestions and insights.

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell and feeling the aftereffects

POST: Back when I was about 13, I was absolutely insane for Taco Bell. We decided to eat there after a long day of soccer and I ordered my grand 3 hard tacos combo and ate up.
Later that night, the tacos thought it would be a fine-ass idea to retaliate and make me feel worse than Billy Ray Cyrus felt about the progression of his shit daughter Miley. Trying to ignore the wrenching stomach pains, I went to bed and expected to wake up fine in the morning. 
I woke up at about 3AM, stomach pains pounding in my interior.
Well, knowing things couldn't be good, I expected to puke. Being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I thought "fuck-it, Ill hold it in and go back to bed.". Well, what a great idea that I pulled out of my ass.
Minutes later, puke gushed out of my mouth like Niagara Falls, hitting the left side of my bed and forming a nice pile.
Still being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I dismissed the idea of cleaning it up right now and thought "Hell, I need some sleep, I'll just do it in the morning."
So I went back to a peaceful slumber.

The next morning, I awoke with a disgusting stench and finally comprehended what had gone on the night before. I looked to where the puke should have been, but there was only an orange stain and a bit of chunky leftovers there. Fuck you, Taco Bell.
I immediately look down and see puke all over my blankets, clothing, and even bare skin. Being the movement-filled sleeper I am, I must have rolled around in the pile of puke during my sleep and successfully got it all over my bed sheets and body.
Feeling defeated, I shamefully took a long ass shower that morning and washed my bed sheets.

TL;DR: I ate Taco Bell, felt the aftereffects, and then rolled around in my own puke while sleeping. I learned that Taco Bell is not worth the pain and discomfort.

EDITS:

* Added a bit more detail to the story
* Changed the title to make it more descriptive
* Added a TL;DR for those who don't want to read the whole story

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author ate Taco Bell and then proceeded to roll around in their own puke while sleeping, making for a cringe-worthy and entertaining story. The post has received over 1,000 comments and has been upvoted over 10,000 times, making it a popular and well-received post on the r/tifu subreddit.

TITLE: Help me lose those last few pounds!

POST: Obviously swim suit season is fast approaching, and I'd like to be in my best shape this summer. Here are the facts:
*I'm 21, female, and pretty much any extra weight I carry in my stomach.

*I'm not overweight by any means. I'm about 5'5" and fluctuate between 120 and 125 pounds.

*My body is...disproportionate, which will tie in with the first two bullets. I have very long legs, and a pretty short torso, which means pretty much ANY extra weight is visible in my stomach (since, as mentioned, I carry weight in my stomach).

Here's where r/loseit comes in. What do I do to lose those stubborn pounds in my stomach? I'm very active, I play soccer and ultimate frisbee all the time, so it's not a big deal to exercise, and I eat fairly well, though I will splurge here and there. Are there specific stomach-targeting exercises or diets that have worked for other people? I feel like I've been carrying around these same 5 pounds for half a decade now.

TL;DR: 21-year-old female, 5'5", 120-125 pounds, looking to lose those last few pounds in my stomach. Active, eat fairly well, but struggle with stubborn belly fat. Help!

---

**REPLIES:**

1. **u/fitnessfreak2000**: Hey there! I'm glad you're motivated to get in shape for swim suit season. As you mentioned, you're already active, which is awesome. For targeting belly fat, I recommend incorporating exercises that engage your core muscles, such as planks, crunches, and leg raises. You can also try high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts, which have been shown to be effective for burning belly fat.

Additionally, make sure you're eating a balanced diet that's low in processed foods and added sugars. Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. You can also try incorporating healthy fats like avocado and nuts into your diet.

Remember, losing weight and toning up takes time and patience. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see results right away. Keep up the good work and stay consistent!

2. **u/healthyliving101**: Hi there! I totally understand your frustration with stubborn belly fat. As a health enthusiast, I can tell you that it's not just about exercising or dieting, but also about making lifestyle changes.

Firstly, make sure you're getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can increase cortisol levels, which can contribute to belly fat. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.

Secondly, try incorporating more omega-3 rich foods into your diet, such as salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds. Omega-3s have been shown to help reduce inflammation and improve overall health.

Lastly, try incorporating more probiotics into your diet. Probiotics can help regulate your gut health, which can also help reduce belly fat. You can find probiotics in foods like yogurt, kefir, and fermented vegetables.

Remember, it's all about making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term. Good luck on your fitness journey!

3. **u/fitnessmotivation**: Hey girl! I totally get it - it can be frustrating when you're trying to lose weight and it seems like it's not happening. But trust me, you're doing great just by being active and eating well!

For targeting belly fat, I recommend trying some exercises that engage your transverse abdominis muscle, such as bicycle crunches and Russian twists. These exercises can help strengthen your core and burn belly fat.

Also, make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can cause bloating and discomfort, which can make it seem like you're not losing weight as quickly as you'd like.

Lastly, try to reduce your stress levels. High levels of stress can cause your body to produce more cortisol, which can contribute to belly fat. Try incorporating some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, such as yoga or meditation.

Remember, you got this! Keep up the good work and stay motivated!

TITLE: My boyfriend all but purposely makes me aware that he watches porn. I don't know how to broach this without sounding cray. (22f/23m)

POST: Let me first say, as a female, I very much enjoy porn. I watch it often. I do not expect my boyfriend not to watch porn when I am not around. It's normal. I am 22 and he is 23. We have lived together for 2 years.

HOW FUCKING EVER,

Every time I open my god damn laptop, there's porn.  I unflip the iPad, there's porn. I feel like every time I use a piece of technology for the day, he has already used it, beat off on it, and left the porn open for me to see.  I have come home to my laptop covered in astroglide. I open to pages of forums where he has sorted through 8 pages just to find titties when he is "using the iPad for homework" and can't be bothered to converse with me.

I don't know why I am hurt, but I am. I am a very reasonable girl and I have expressed my concern; I don't want to see the girls you beat off to. However, every chance he is presented with to make it subtley known, he takes it. Most delete their history, this son of a bitch rubs it in my face time and time again.

Is this passive aggressive? I don't see how he could be so forgetful when I have expressed my discomfort.  Wat do? How could I confront him? Do I try to shrug it off? I don't like to make a big deal out of something so stupid, but gah.

TL;DR: Boyfriend constantly leaves porn open on my devices, makes me aware of it, and won't delete his history. I'm hurt and don't know how to broach this without sounding crazy.

---

**Top comments:**

1. "Girl, you're not being crazy. You have every right to feel uncomfortable and hurt. It's not about the porn itself, it's about the disrespect and lack of consideration he's showing you. You need to have a calm and honest conversation with him about how his actions are affecting you. Don't attack him, but express your feelings and needs. You deserve better than to feel like you're walking on eggshells around your own devices."
2. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not about being 'crazy' or'stupid' to feel uncomfortable about this. It's a valid concern. You're right to want to talk to him about it. Just approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Ask him how he feels about your porn habits and if he's ever felt uncomfortable about it. Maybe he's not even aware of how his actions are affecting you."
3. "I think you should try to have a conversation with him about it, but also consider setting some boundaries. You can say something like, 'Hey, I understand that you enjoy porn, but I'd appreciate it if you could keep your devices private when I'm not around.' It's not about controlling him, but about respecting your own boundaries and feelings."
4. "I'm a guy and I have to say, I would be really uncomfortable if my girlfriend found out I was watching porn on her devices. It's not about the porn itself, but about the invasion of privacy and disrespect. You're right to feel hurt and you should definitely talk to him about it. Just be prepared for him to get defensive and try to downplay it. Stay calm and assertive and make it clear that you're not okay with this behavior."
5. "I think you should try to see this as a bigger issue than just the porn. It sounds like your boyfriend is not respecting your boundaries or your feelings. He's not making an effort to communicate with you or consider your needs. You deserve better than that. You should think about whether this relationship is healthy for you and whether you're getting the respect and love you deserve."

TITLE: My [20F] Boyfriend [20M] Said He Doesn't Love Me

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 month and 1 week, on a date this Friday we were going for a walk and I told him that I love him. He seemed caught off guard by it and he didn't say he loves me back, which was upsetting but I didn't want to make him feel bad for not loving me back so I tried to just change the topic and continue on with our day. Now today we've been texting about it and I asked if he feels like he loves me, and he said he doesn't know yet and that he's confused, we haven't been dating very long and stuff. I felt offended by that since he was basically saying that our relationship isn't special to him in a way, and that he doesn't feel like it's serious or anything. Do you think I said it too early in our relationship? Or am I right about him not being committed by not saying it back? Keep in mind we were sort of "dating" for a couple weeks before the 1 month and 1 week even, that's just when we became official.

TL;DR: Boyfriend didn't say he loves me back after I told him I love him, said he doesn't know yet and is confused, and that we haven't been dating long enough for him to feel that way. I feel offended and unsure if I said it too early or if he's just not committed.

**Responses:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for people to not say 'I love you' right away, especially in the early stages of a relationship. It's possible that he's just not ready to say it yet, or maybe he's not sure how he feels. Instead of taking it as a personal rejection, try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Ask him what he needs from you to feel comfortable saying 'I love you' back. It's possible that he's just not used to expressing his feelings or that he's worried about saying it too soon. Try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and see where it takes you."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly. Just because he didn't say 'I love you' back right away doesn't mean he's not committed or that he doesn't feel the same way. It's possible that he's just not used to saying those words or that he's not sure how to express himself. Instead of getting offended, try to have a calm and rational conversation with him about how you're feeling. Ask him what he's thinking and feeling, and see if you can work through this together. Remember that relationships are about communication and compromise, so try to approach this conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If he's not willing to say 'I love you' back after you've told him you love him, that's a pretty big red flag. It's possible that he's not emotionally available or that he's not interested in a serious relationship. Don't get me wrong, it's okay if he's not ready to say it yet, but if he's not willing to even have a conversation about it, that's a problem. I would suggest taking some time to think about what you want from this relationship and whether or not it's worth pursuing."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on him to say 'I love you' back right away. Instead of focusing on the words, try to focus on the actions and behaviors that show he cares about you. Is he making an effort to spend time with you, listen to you, and support you? If so, then that's what matters most. Don't get caught up in the romance and drama of it all, focus on building a strong and healthy relationship. Remember that relationships are about growth, compromise, and communication, so try to approach this conversation with a growth mindset and an open heart."

**Conclusion:**

The responses to this post vary in their advice and opinions, but most agree that it's not uncommon for people to not say "I love you" right away, especially in the early stages of a relationship. Some suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling, while others recommend taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but it's important to remember that relationships are about communication, compromise, and growth. Take the time to think about what you want from this relationship and whether or not it's worth pursuing.

TITLE: Me 26M with my girlfriend 25F of 4 months, wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral but i haven't met her family

POST: So my girlfriend has anxiety and is very emotional. I tend to solve problems more logically etc. Anyways, she asked if I'd go to her grandmother's funeral depending on when it was. Her grandma is currently in hospice so the time is coming soon. I've never been to a funeral before and I've never met my girlfriend's family.

The twist is that she doesn't have a good relationship with her dad and refuses to talk to him. This creates tension with her mom and her sister who live with her dad. I don't really think it's appropriate to be meeting her family at a funeral and I don't know her grandma at all. I told my girlfriend I'd take off work or whatever possible to be there for her after she gets home from the funeral (we don't live together). However, she started crying saying she really needs me there and needs someone to hold her hand. 

While I understand the logic behind this, it's also a big deal for me because 1. Her dad and her are in a feud and I really don't want to be a part of any sort of family drama at a funeral. 2. Meeting her mom and her sister or any family at her mom's funeral is going to be weird to me. Everyone's going to be crying and I don't know any of them yet, so the first time I meet them all it's going to be really sad. 3. I've never been to a funeral before and the closest thing is being in the room while putting my favorite childhood dog down with my family.

Girlfriend got really upset when I told her these reasons and said she expects to have a boyfriend who is there to support her. I understand her perspective which is why I offered to be there for her after she gets back. But she really wants to hold hands during the funeral itself.

Don't know what to do! I told her I'd think about it more, but she is still upset that she might have to 'ask someone else to go with her'.

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral, but I've never met her family and it's a big deal for me. I'm worried about family drama and not knowing anyone. She's upset that I'm not willing to go and hold her hand during the funeral.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's a lot to ask of you to go to a funeral, especially when you've never met her family before. It's understandable that you're hesitant. Maybe you could compromise and offer to be there for her after the funeral, like you already did? That way you're still showing your support without putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation."
2. **u/sarcastic_sally**: "Girlfriend is being super unreasonable here. You're not obligated to go to a funeral just because she wants you to. It's okay to prioritize your own comfort and boundaries. Tell her you're willing to be there for her after the funeral, but you're not comfortable going to the funeral itself."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're being reasonable here. It's understandable that you're hesitant to go to a funeral, especially when you've never met her family before. Maybe you could have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. It's also important to remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in a relationship."
4. **u/awkward_situation**: "I think you should just go to the funeral. It's a big deal for your girlfriend and it would mean a lot to her if you were there. You can always talk to her about your concerns and see if you can find a way to make it work. Remember, relationships are about compromise and understanding each other's needs."
5. **u/neutral_observer**: "I think you're being reasonable here. It's understandable that you're hesitant to go to a funeral, especially when you've never met her family before.

TITLE: TIFU by graping a guy in the head

POST: So I live in Chicago, and I fucking hate taxis. Like a lot. I swear to god those little yellow bastards are the source of all evil. The Holocaust? Taxis. Ebola? It was the taxis. My fourth grade teacher who told me my nose was big? Fucking taxis. 

I live in a 24th floor condo in Lincoln Park, and on one fine summer afternoon, I had a bowl of grapes, a balcony, and an opportunity. My burgers on the grill, I reclined in a lounge chair on the balcony and began my assault. I tossed my first grape at the first taxi, and missed. Of course, but hey, it's the thought that counts. 

A couple of grapes later, I tossed a juicy purple ball of death down, aiming for the sickening yellow roof of my sworn enemy, when along came a convertible. Nice car, I thought as the grape soared down to its target. Then the wind gusted. I lost sight of my weapon as it traveled to its final destination. I finally found it just before I saw the driver of the lovely white convertible swerve, clutching his bald head. I'm now holed up in my office after I heard sirens and saw a cop car pull over next to my accidental victim.

TL;DR: I threw a grape at a taxi and accidentally hit the driver in the head. I'm now hiding in my office, waiting for the police to arrive.

TITLE: My friend's sister [WI] is being scammed by an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon. Is there anything we can do?

POST: It's a long story and it doesn't really matter but essentially my friend's sister (lives in WI) met someone on Match.com and has sent somewhere in the neighborhood of $30k to this Internet woman who claims to live in Oregon.

Based on [this Travel.state.gov report] (not to mention *common sense*) it is beyond a doubt that this person is a scammer.

For anyone who finds this thread in the future, a [quick search] of Reddit turned up the following similar old threads: [1] [2] [3] [4](

The scammer *IS* a real person, a white female with a foreign accent who claims to be Italian-American, has talked to my friend's sister on Skype, and based on some basic sleuthing has a phone number that seems to be a land line in Oregon. She claims to run an antique business that does appear to have a website, but there is zero actual information on it so it pretty clearly looks like a shell.

So far here are the best tips I've seen:

* Reverse image search this lady's Match.com photos
* Investigate the land line and antique business (not sure how)

I would *happily* post this scammer's personal information on 4chan or wherever if I really knew how that worked but I understand the "not your personal army" business.

It has gotten so bad that my friend and other members of the family are saying that this sister needs to give them financial power of attorney so that she doesn't keep sending all her SSI checks to this sketchy woman. It's a good step but if the sister doesn't go along with it it'll never happen.

I've seen advice on here before that ultimately going after the scammer isn't going to lead anywhere, and the problem needs to be fixed at home. I'm just asking to make sure.

TL;DR: Friend's sister in WI is being scammed by an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon. Scammer has sent $30k, has a fake antique business, and has a real phone number in Oregon. What can we do?

TITLE: [NY] Am I required by state Labor Law to take a meal break after 6 hrs of work?

POST: Or can I elect to work through my so-called "legally mandated" 30 minute unpaid meal break without penal rescourse againt my employer?

I write full-time for a New York newspaper owned by an out-of-state conglomerate. I am paid hourly. My workplace is not unionized (except, for some reason, the mail room).
 
The explanation I have been given, which seems similar to one given to r/BrainStewYumYum in a [post] from Pennsylvania, is that a previous audit exposed the company to fines and repayment for not properly allowing meal breaks.

I rarely have time for an uninterrupted meal break, given the unpredictability of calls and schedule limitations of officials and often informal, chaotic schedule. I eat of course, but frequently in small poritons on the fly over even an eight hour period, often nothing more than a midday snack after breakfast at home on a sixer.

Essentially I clock 3 hrs weekly of untaken break. At a paltry $13.50/hr, that's a significant yearly loss of roughly $2,000. I have been threatened with three verbal warnings for the violation, a fourth will elevate discipline to a written warning.

Am I at the mercy of the company's self-proclaimed workplace statutes on this one, or am I permited under Labor Law to be paid for the time worked?

TL;DR: Am I required by NY Labor Law to take a 30-minute unpaid meal break after 6 hours of work? Can I elect to work through this break without penalty?

---

**Response from a lawyer:**

Hello! I'm a labor lawyer in New York, and I'd be happy to help you with your question.

First, let's clarify that the New York Labor Law does require employers to provide employees with a 30-minute unpaid meal break after six hours of work. However, this break is not necessarily mandatory, and employees are not required to take it.

In your case, since you are paid hourly, you are entitled to be paid for all hours worked, including the time spent on your meal break. If you choose to work through your meal break, you should be paid for that time.

However, it's important to note that your employer may have a policy requiring you to take a meal break, and failing to comply with that policy could result in disciplinary action. If you're concerned about the impact of not taking a meal break on your job, you may want to speak with your employer to discuss your options.

It's also worth noting that if you're consistently working through your meal break without taking a break, you may be entitled to overtime pay. Under New York Labor Law, employees who work more than 40 hours in a week are entitled to overtime pay at a rate of one and a half times their regular hourly rate.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

---

**Additional comments from the subreddit community:**

* "As a lawyer, I can tell you that the OP is absolutely right. They are entitled to be paid for all hours worked, including the time spent on their meal break. If the employer is trying to penalize them for not taking a meal break, that's a clear violation of the Labor Law."
* "I'm not a lawyer, but I think the OP should just take the break and enjoy their lunch. It's not worth risking their job over a 30-minute unpaid break."
* "I've worked in the newspaper industry for years, and I can tell you that the OP is not alone in this struggle. Many of us have to work through our lunch breaks to meet deadlines. It's just part of the job."
* "I'm a manager at a newspaper, and I can tell you that we have a strict policy about taking meal breaks. If an employee doesn't take their break, they're not getting paid for it. It's not up to the employee to decide whether or not to take a break, it's up to the employer to ensure that they're taking their breaks."
* "I think the OP should speak with a labor lawyer and get a clear understanding of their rights. They may be entitled to back pay for the time they've worked without taking a break."

TITLE: The dreaded semester abroad

POST: So I've known this girl since middle school, and I've been hopelessly in love with her ever since. I mean I don't know if it's love, because what is love, blah blah blah and so forth. But anyways, we were off and on in high school, we went to different colleges and we've both been with a bunch of other people, but we always come back to each other. She's told me a bunch of times that she loves me too, and that she doesn't want anybody else, but at the same time it's never really been exclusive and I don't think it would last too long if we tried to make it exclusive. Neither of us has ever lasted long in a committed relationship.

She's going to Australia next week for a semester, I'm not gonna talk to her much for a few months and she's probably gonna meet a bunch of guys who surf and play guitar on the beach and wrestle crocodiles for fun. I'm a little bit beside myself, but at the same time I want her to go and have fun and get the most out of it.

I wonder if anyone's ever had a similar situation? I'd like to give her something she could take with her that would make her think of me once in a while, whenever she takes it out and looks at it. Something really sweet that'll make her go "aaawwww!"  I know it's kind of an obscure request seeing as how nobody knows either of us, but it doesn't have to be something personal. And any ideas might help me think of something. I know this is something I should come up with on my own, but romance was never my thing and I don't have much time left. 

And honestly it doesn't have to be a gift, it could just be something we do before she leaves, but the gift idea seemed good to me. Like I said I'm really bad at this. Please help me!!!

TL;DR: Girl I've been in love with since middle school is going to Australia for a semester, I'm worried she'll meet other guys and forget about me. I want to give her something to take with her that'll make her think of me, something sweet and romantic. Help me out!

**Top comments:**

1. "Dude, I think you're being a bit dramatic. She's going to Australia for a semester, not forever. She'll come back and you can rekindle things. Just be patient and don't be a clingy boyfriend. Give her space and let her have her adventure. As for the gift, how about a personalized journal or a photo album with pictures of the two of you? That way she can think of you whenever she looks at it."
2. "I had a similar situation with my ex. She went abroad for a year and I was worried she'd meet other guys. But you know what? She came back and we reconnected. We even got back together for a bit. The key is to not be too clingy and give her space. As for the gift, I think a customized keychain or a small memento that represents your relationship would be nice. Something that's not too expensive or over-the-top, but still shows you care."
3. "I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with her about your feelings and tell her how you're feeling. She might appreciate the vulnerability and honesty. As for the gift, how about a small plant or a succulent that she can take care of while she's away? It's a symbol of your love and care for her, and it's something she can nurture while she's away."
4. "I think you're being a bit possessive. She's going to Australia for a semester, not forever. Let her have her adventure and don't try to control her. As for the gift, how about a small gift card to her favorite store or restaurant? That way she can treat herself to something nice while she's away."
5. "I think you should focus on building a stronger connection with her before she leaves. Have meaningful conversations, share your feelings, and show her that you care. As for the gift, how about a customized playlist of your favorite songs or a small piece of jewelry that represents your relationship? Something that's personal and meaningful to both of you."

TITLE: TIFU by shooting a friend 2 Times in the head by accident

POST: So, this happend not today, but on the weekend. We went out to play football (if you're American, you'll call it soccer) on a field nearby. The game was quite even, noone scored. So we decided to take penalty shots to determine the winner. I went for the shot, kicked it hard and hit my friend straight in the face. His nose startet bleeding and he went deep into rage, while I was feeling sorry and the rest laughed thier ass of. Anyways, later that day, we played counterstrike together. He went out mid, I was playing awp, he walked into my shot, boom teamkill headshot. His rage in Teamspeak went over 9000 while our team (same guys from the football game) died laughing. My friend however got so pissed he ragequitted the game and we lost. This way I lost a good friend and my CSGO rank.

TL;DR: I accidentally shot my friend in the face during a penalty shootout, then accidentally killed him in a game of counterstrike, and now he's mad at me and we're no longer friends.

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author accidentally shoots their friend in the face during a penalty shootout, and then later that day, they accidentally kill their friend in a game of Counter-Strike. The post is humorous and relatable, and the author's use of language and tone adds to the comedic effect. The story is also a great example of how a simple mistake can lead to a chain of events that can have unintended consequences. The author's friend is understandably upset, and the author's CSGO rank suffers as a result. The post is a great example of how a TIFU story can be both funny and cautionary.

TITLE: Reddit, tell me about your douchebag friend stories. I'll start

POST: So I just kind of need to vent, and I can't imagine that I'm the only one with douchebag friends.

So heres my story about... Let's call him R.

R. is a constant show-off. He's had sex with 3 girls. 1 borderline chick who faked pregnancy every month, 1 ugly chick, who was another friends ex he kept bragging about, and his (now) ex-girlfriend.

So his girlfriend recently broke up with him, because generally, he's a douchebag, smokes weed all day, and lies alot. I can't believe they've been together for over a year, because she's actually a really nice girl.

The week after they broke up, he tells me he got a girls phone number. 'Lookie me, I'm hot stuff, I got a girls phone number! She was totally into me!'. I tell him grats, good for you, and carry on. 2 days later, he tells me he got 4 other phone numbers from extroardinally hot girls.

He tells me the story of how he got the number for each girl individually. By the third girl it's getting old, but eh, I'm his friend, so I'll sit and listen. He then proceeds to tell this same story to ALL our other friends, making everybody hear the story like 3 times.

R. is not a very good looking guy. He dresses poor, he IS poor, actually, and doesn't pay attention to hygiene a whole lot. Yet he constantly keeps bragging about getting girls phone numbers, and then asks me what the last time was I had sex. (I came out of a long relationship,

TL;DR: Douchebag friend R. constantly shows off about getting girls phone numbers, lies about his life, and is generally a poor, unhygienic, and unattractive guy who thinks he's hot stuff.

TITLE: My [M 20] ex [21 F] is a close part of my friend group. Makes no contact near impossible and moving on more difficult.

POST: So I recently went through a somewhat messy breakup with my girlfriend of 6 months where she kinda cheated on me or at least I felt cheated on. Before being my girlfriend, she was my best friend for a year and close friend for many years before that. 

Now my high school friend group is a really close group of friends that she is a part of that has stayed close even throughout college. We all still see each other and hangout often. 

So after the breakup I prescribed to the No contact thing. We both agreed to cut off all texting and social media contact which has been really helping me for the past three weeks. The only problem is that if I still want to see my friends as often as i'd like, I do have to see her in group settings and the last two times it happened it has sent me into an anxious wreck because I see her texting or snapchatting the guy that she cheated on me with. I get that she's free to do what she wants but I just feel so betrayed and horrible everytime I see it. 

I don't know what t do reddit. I can't just never see my friends and become a shut in. These people are my closest friends in the world for a long time but I need help dealing with the minimal contact very week or every other week I need to have with her for a night of hanging out.

 Also I should point that the group is usually more than 5 or 6 people and I'm not trying to be friendly with her. I'm civil with her for the sake of it not being awkward but I don't by any means want to be close friends with her. I like the idea of no contact.

TL;DR: Ex is part of my friend group and I'm having trouble dealing with minimal contact with her every week or every other week. I feel anxious and betrayed every time I see her with the guy she cheated on me with. Help me deal with this situation.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling anxious and betrayed. Have you considered talking to your friends about how you're feeling? They might not even realize the impact that her presence is having on you. Maybe they can help mediate the situation or find ways for you to avoid her if needed."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think it's great that you're taking steps to prioritize your own emotional well-being by limiting contact with your ex. However, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your boundaries and needs. It's okay to set boundaries and communicate them clearly. You don't have to be friends with your ex, but you also don't have to avoid your friends because of her presence."
3. **u/itsokaytobesad**: "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered taking some time for yourself to process your emotions and reflect on what you want for your future? It might be helpful to focus on building new connections and relationships that are positive and uplifting for you."
4. **u/itscomplicated**: "I think it's interesting that you're saying you don't want to be close friends with her, but you're still civil with her for the sake of not being awkward. Maybe it's worth exploring why you're still holding onto that level of civility. Are you doing it out of obligation or because you genuinely want to maintain a connection with her? If it's the former, maybe it's time to re-evaluate that dynamic and prioritize your own emotional well-being."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's also important to consider that your ex's actions are not your problem to solve. You can't control how she behaves or who she chooses to be with. What you can control is how you respond to the situation and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Maybe it's time to focus on building a support network of people who uplift and support you, rather than trying to navigate a complicated situation with your ex."

TITLE: TIFU by farting at the wrong time

POST: This actualy happened yesterday night but anywho. Me and my SO had a friend coming over but we decided to have a quickie before our friend arrive. So etc things happen and then my SO gets a call from our friend saying that he was close to me and my SO's apartment. The thing is that right before the call happened I was at my climax and so when my SO answered the phone i was left there for barely 30secs but felt like hours. After the phone call is done we finish what we started but as I came to release a squeaky long fart follows. 

I couldn't believe that this happened to me, I have read stories about this happening on alot of sites like 9gag and here on Reddit. I was dying of embarassement.

We just laughed it off and now here I am laughing by myself writing this for you Redditors to enjoy!

TL;DR: I farted at the wrong time during a quickie with my SO and our friend was about to arrive. I'm still laughing about it.

EDITS:

* Added more details
* Changed the title to better fit the story
* Added a TL;DR for easier reading

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable anecdote about a time when they messed up or did something embarrassing. The post is well-written, with a clear and concise narrative, and the author's self-deprecating humor and ability to laugh at themselves make the story even more enjoyable to read. The use of a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary at the end also helps to make the post more accessible and easy to understand. Overall, this post is a great example of a well-written and entertaining TIFU story.

TITLE: Friend [17 F] likes me romantically but I [17 M] am just not attracted to her at all. How can I let her down but stay friends?

POST: I've had a suspicion for a while that she liked me and it was confirmed a few days ago when her friends told me that she did. She has a bit of a history of mental problems like anxiety and depression, and I don't want her to fall back into that because of me (It happened before with another guy.)

I'm just not attracted to her so I'm not going to start a relationship with her but I want to let her down easy and in a way that we can still be friends. I'm pretty inexperienced with this so I have no idea how to go about that.

TL;DR: Friend likes me romantically, I'm not attracted to her, want to let her down easy and stay friends.

---

**Top comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's great that you're thinking about her mental health. You could try having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Let her know that you value your friendship and don't want to lead her on, but you don't feel the same way romantically. Be kind and empathetic, and reassure her that you'll still be there for her as a friend."
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I agree with the above comment. It's better to be honest and direct than to lead her on or ignore her feelings. You could say something like, 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us. I really value our friendship and I think you're an amazing person, but I don't feel the same way romantically. I don't want to hurt you, but I think it's better if we just stay friends.'"
* **u/sad_kitty**: "I'm a girl and I've been in a similar situation before. It's really hard to hear that someone you like doesn't feel the same way, but it's better to know the truth than to be left wondering. Just be kind and respectful, and try to understand where she's coming from. And hey, you might still be able to have a great friendship with her even if it's not romantic."
* **u/throwaway123456**: "Also, it might be a good idea to have this conversation in a private setting, like over coffee or a walk, rather than in a public place or in front of her friends. You want to make sure she feels comfortable and supported during the conversation."

TITLE: A new girl [16 F] just started at my work. I [17 M] tried messaging her but she won't answer

POST: This girl started at my work last week, she is a pretty girl and we seemed to hit it off. I added her on Facebook and sent her a message. It's been a couple of days now and she's been online a few times but I haven't gotten a reply. She might have seen the message but forgot to reply but it says she hasn't opened it yet. I don't work the same shifts as her and we don't go to school together otherwise I'd ask her number and I don't know how else to get a hold of her. Should I send her another message?  What should I say? Or does it seem like I should just forget about it? Thanks for your help

TL;DR: I added a new girl at work on Facebook and sent her a message, but she hasn't replied. Should I send another message or just forget about it?

REPLIES:

* "Don't be discouraged if she doesn't reply right away. Maybe she's just busy or not comfortable with online messaging. Try sending her another message in a few days and see if she responds then."
* "It's possible she's not interested in talking to you, and that's okay. Don't take it personally and just focus on your work. There are plenty of other people to talk to and make friends with."
* "If you're really interested in talking to her, you could try sending her a message in a different way, like a funny meme or a question about something you both have in common. Just be respectful and don't be pushy."
* "It's okay to ask someone out or try to get to know them, but don't be too pushy or aggressive. If she's not interested, respect her boundaries and move on."
* "Maybe she's just not comfortable with online messaging and prefers to talk in person. Try striking up a conversation with her when you see her at work and see if you can get to know her better that way."

This post is a good example of a common problem that many people face in online communication: not getting a response from someone you're interested in talking to. The OP is unsure of what to do and is seeking advice from the community. The replies offer a range of suggestions, from sending another message to trying to get to know her in person. The conversation is respectful and helpful, and the OP is able to get some useful advice and insights from the community.

TITLE: I( f/25) hooked up with my boss (m/53). Now how do I act?

POST: I hooked up with my boss. He is the CEO of the company I work for. I knew he was married but didn't find out until later he had like 8 kids. Ack!

I have no intentions to be a home wrecker, so that's done with. However, he was the one who invited me to his hotel room and since we were both attracted to each other, we pretty much hooked up then and there. 

Now that we hooked up, he calls me every so randomly to meet up with me some more. Professionally he is hard to me in front of everyone. Then he would take me aside and ask me out for drinks. 

Anyway we haven't hooked up since that night because I never gave him the chance. How should I put it to him lightly that I don't want to hook up anymore? Deep down I'm still sexually attracted to him, but I don't want him to know because he will keep pushing it.

TL;DR: Hooked up with my 53-year-old boss, married with 8 kids. He still calls me to meet up, but I don't want to hook up again. How do I tell him without hurting his feelings?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's best to be direct and clear with him. You can say something like, 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our situation. I had a great time with you, but I don't feel comfortable pursuing anything further. I think it's best if we just keep our relationship professional.' Be firm but polite, and don't give him false hope."
2. **u/relationship_expert**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It's essential to be clear and direct. However, you might also want to consider the potential consequences of your actions. As the CEO's employee, you're in a position of power imbalance, and it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and career. If you're not comfortable with the situation, it might be best to distance yourself from him professionally as well."
3. **u/anonymous_user**: "I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but have you considered the possibility that he might be having an affair and is using you as a way to justify his actions to himself? As the CEO's employee, you're in a vulnerable position, and it's possible that he's taking advantage of that. Be cautious and prioritize your own safety and well-being."
4. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's also important to remember that you're not obligated to justify your actions or feelings to anyone, including your boss. You did what you did, and now you're trying to move forward. Don't feel guilty or ashamed about it, and don't give him any more of your time or energy than you need to. You deserve to prioritize your own happiness and well-being."
5. **u/relationship_advisor**: "I would suggest having a calm and respectful conversation with your boss, focusing on your own feelings and boundaries rather than his. You can say something like, 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our situation. I had a great time with you, but I've been thinking a lot about it, and I don't feel comfortable pursuing anything further. I think it's best if we just keep our relationship professional.' Remember to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being throughout the conversation."

TITLE: I've fallen back in love...

POST: This is just a personal achievement for me, but I have just read my first book in months.

Ever since my uncle passed away (he was like a father to me) I haven't been able to pick up a book and read. This is an issue as I had what my family rightfully explained as "book cravings".

I would actually get antsy if I hadn't read for a day or so, which meant that being employed full-time I found myself reading smaller novels, mostly aimed at teens (yes this includes all those vampire fictions, it was interesting to see whether the storylines differed. I'm female which made it seem less weird I guess!), just to satisfy my mind. 

The week after my uncle's funeral I engrossed myself in as many books as I could, as the previous week was spent helping my mum, grandma and sisters plan his funeral

The last novel I read was about a week after he passed away, was "Cleo" by Helen Brown. I am a great cat lover but it was more than a story about a cat and the antics it gets up to. It's about healing. And it was also the first book that almost brought me to tears. But since then I just couldn't read.

I still borrowed books but they stayed in my bag until they were due back.

Anyway, today I walked into a bookstore on a whim, and picked up "After Cleo: Came Jonah" as I loved "Cleo", and hadn't realised she had released a second book.

It was beautiful. It didn't make me want to cry, and the feel of the novel was different, but it worked so well. I actually now physically feel lighter after reading it (I started it about 5:30pm, it's now 9:50pm! Not a bad time!) and it's funny how I didn't realise I had this dark weight above me.

Just feels good to get back in touch with the book-craving me again :)

TL;DR: I've fallen back in love with reading after a 6-month hiatus due to personal reasons. I'm thrilled to be back in the world of books!

COMMENTS:

* "Welcome back to the world of books! I'm glad to hear you've found a new book that resonated with you. 'After Cleo: Came Jonah' sounds like a great read. I'm sure it's wonderful to be back in touch with your book-craving self again."
* "I'm so happy to hear that you've found a new book that's brought you back to reading! It's amazing how a good book can lift our spirits and help us heal. I'm sure your uncle would be proud of you for finding a way to cope with your grief through reading."
* "I'm glad you're back to reading! It's great that you found a book that resonated with you and helped you feel lighter. Sometimes it's hard to find the motivation to read when we're going through tough times, but it sounds like you've found a new book that's helping you heal."
* "I'm so happy to hear that you're back to reading! It's amazing how a good book can bring us joy and comfort. I'm sure your uncle would be proud of you for finding a way to cope with your grief through reading."

TITLE: She [F24] went silent. I [M27] have no explanation why.

POST: 1. Tinder meetup. 
1. A couple of casual dates. Enjoy each other's company + conversation. Interest is still there in both directions.
1. Nice restaurant dinner date. Perfect evening + flowing conversation. Interest increasing in both directions.
1. Home cooked dinner date (at mine) + movie + sex. Having a very nice time with this woman.
1. Friday evening restaurant dinner date. More easy + deep conversation. Go to a bar for a few wines. Walk her home, hang out for 15 minutes, listen to some music etc. She was visibly tired from a long dayshift so we end the evening. Kiss on the lips good night.
1. That was over the course of 3 or 4 weeks. I've had complete silence ever since (10 days). She has not blocked me anywhere, just complete lack of response. I kept contact to a minimum once I realised something was not right (we went from daily SMS in the week preceding to nothing). Two days ago I tried calling, no answer so I left a final SMS and plan on leaving the ball in her court.  

What reasons could she have for going completely silent?    

Possibly relevant points: Came out of a 5 year relationship approx 1 year ago. Is very intelligent. I did not detect any signals that her interest was waning.

TL;DR: Went on 4-5 dates with a woman, things were going great, then she went silent. No explanation, no blocking, just complete lack of response. What could be the reason?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "It's possible that she's just not interested in pursuing anything further. People can be weird and sometimes they just need space. Try not to overthink it and move on."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "It's also possible that she's dealing with some personal issues or emotional baggage from her previous relationship. Give her some space and don't be too pushy. If she wants to talk, she'll reach out."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're overestimating the connection you had. You guys went on a few dates, had some fun, and then she ghosted you. It's not uncommon for people to do this, especially if they're not really interested."
4. **u/just_a_random_user**: "Have you tried reaching out to her friends or mutual friends to see if they know what's going on? Sometimes people will talk to friends before talking to the person they're interested in."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "It's possible that she's just not ready for a relationship or is dealing with some personal issues. Try not to take it personally and focus on yourself. You deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you and willing to communicate openly."

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for the comments, guys. I appreciate the advice. I did try reaching out to her friends, but they said they haven't spoken to her in a while and don't know what's going on. I'm trying not to overthink it, but it's hard not to wonder what happened. I'll just have to move on and focus on myself. Thanks again for the input."

TITLE: I believe Me [21 F] and my Boyfriend [23 M] of almost two years are about to breakup.

POST: Everything is perfect between us, me and Paul. But I am realizing that our personality differences are creating a gap that I cannot see myself able to get over for the rest of my life. All it really comes down to(in EXTREMELY simplified terms) is that I am passionate and sociable, and he is quiet and secluded. I consistently feel that I have to tame myself in order to keep him happy, and I know that in the long run, this is only going to damage both of us. We've had many conversations about how we shouldn't try to change the other person, but I am worried that if I don't leave, I /will/ change and I am not okay with the person I would need to become. 

So  I think it's time to end things, soon....the issue is we live together. Our lease isn't up until February. How am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to explain that, yes, even though everything is perfect, I can't do it anymore?

TL;DR: I'm almost 2 years into a relationship with my boyfriend, but I'm realizing our personality differences are causing a gap that I can't see myself getting over. I'm worried about changing who I am to keep him happy, and I think it's time to end things. But we live together and I don't know how to break the news.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're already doing the right thing by recognizing that you can't change who you are to fit someone else's expectations. It's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. You don't owe it to him to stay in a relationship that's not working for you. As for how to break the news, maybe you could have a calm and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns? It might be tough, but it's better to be upfront and respectful than to drag it out or pretend everything is fine when it's not."
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing your own needs and boundaries. It's not selfish to prioritize your own happiness. As for the logistics of breaking up, maybe you could start by having a conversation with him about your concerns and see where it goes from there? It might be helpful to have a plan in place for how you'll handle the living situation and any shared belongings. Remember that it's okay to take your time and figure things out, and don't feel pressured to rush into anything."
* "I think you're being really brave by acknowledging that this relationship isn't working for you, even though it's hard. It's okay to admit when something isn't right, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness. As for breaking the news, maybe you could try framing it as a conversation about your own growth and development, rather than a criticism of him? You could say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about my own goals and values, and I realize that I need to prioritize my own happiness and fulfillment. I think it's time for us to go our separate ways, but I want to make sure we do it in a way that's respectful and kind to each other.'"

These comments offer words of encouragement and support for the OP's decision to prioritize her own happiness and well-being. They also provide practical advice on how to approach the conversation with her boyfriend and navigate the logistics of breaking up while still living together. The comments emphasize the importance of being honest and respectful, and remind the OP that it's okay to prioritize her own needs and boundaries. Overall, the comments create a supportive and non-judgmental space for the OP to share her concerns and receive guidance and advice.

TITLE: I'm [20F] going to a funeral for the first time, for my [69F] grandmother's [75F] best friend. I don't quite know what to do.

POST: Hi all. Sorry in advance for formatting, I'm on mobile right now. 

Very recently my grandmother's best friend died. She was like a sister to her, and I was also very close with her since I was young. The way she died was absolutely horrific, and my grandmother held her in her arms as she passed.

This Friday an open casket funeral is being held, and my grandma asked me if I would like to go. I told her I would. I have been asked to be at funerals twice before in my life, though I've refused, for (very) distant family.

My problem is that I don't deal with death/the dead well. I am not religious but spiritual. Seeing any type of dead body makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable. I don't believe that any part of a person or'soul'  stays in a body after they die, only that the body is a remaining vessel, not really the person themselves... If that makes sense. My grandma and most of my family understand and respect my beliefs but at the same time, it has always been custom for them to at least view, if not touch/kiss the forehead of their loved ones one last time. I don't think I can touch her body, let alone see it. I can't really describe what it's like, but I just get such a bad feeling from bodies, and I have never seen someone I've loved in a casket before.

Basically, I'd just like some help on how to act appropriately at the funeral, while also avoiding (as much as I can) making myself uncomfortable. In addition, it would also be cool if I could get some tips on etiquette in general, what is appropriate to wear, things like that.

TL;DR: Going to my first funeral for my grandmother's best friend, don't know how to handle seeing her body, want to act respectfully and avoid discomfort.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about seeing your grandmother's best friend in a casket. 

First of all, it's great that you're considering your grandma's feelings and wanting to be there for her. That's really important. 

As for what to wear, you can't go wrong with a simple black dress or suit. It's a funeral, so you want to show respect for the deceased and the family. 

As for the viewing, you don't have to touch or kiss the forehead if it makes you uncomfortable. You can just take a moment to acknowledge her presence and then move on. You can also take a step back if you need to. 

It might be helpful to talk to your grandma about your feelings beforehand. Let her know that you're feeling anxious and see if there's anything she can do to make you feel more comfortable. 

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take care of yourself during this difficult time. If you need to step outside for some fresh air or take a break, don't hesitate to do so. You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask for.

TITLE: me [29m] with my downstairs neighbour [30sf] and her pot smoking habit

POST: I purchased a condo about a year and a half ago and have been having an ongoing problem with the lady who lives downstairs. She smokes pot A LOT. She has told me she has a prescription for it; though we do live in an area where smoking pot is illegal. Her living room is immediately below my bathroom/bedroom. The building is old and has poor insulation which therefore means every time she smokes it fills my bathroom (and bedroom) with the smell of pot. When I first moved in I enquires with all the owners at a meeting (very small building and it's not professional managed) and each one claimed they don't smoke pot. I knew someone was lying as it cannot be smelled while outside, only inside my unit. One day I approached my neighbours door for something unrelated and was hit with the smell of pot as soon as I approached. She's since confirmed that she smokes pot but refuses to stop or smoke it outside. 

Beside the fact that I've never done pot and find the smell disgusting, I'm intending to apply for my city's police department. They have a very strict policy regarding drugs (for example, cutting out family members who do drugs, asking someone who rents to move, etc). I am very concerned that by ignoring this problem and smelling pot all the time I will be affecting my chances of being hired. 

I do not want to involve police if possible. It's a small building and this would cause a lot of animosity. 

I am looking for advice on how to escalate this and hopefully come to a resolution. I have already brought it up but she will claim she's not smoking and has no idea why I'm smelling pot. I'm not sure what my next steps should be (formal complaint, written complaint, etc)

Any advice in how to approach this and (hopefully) maintain an amicable relationship would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I have a downstairs neighbor who smokes pot a lot and it fills my bathroom and bedroom with the smell. She refuses to stop or smoke outside. I'm concerned about the smell affecting my chances of getting hired at the police department and I don't want to involve the police if possible. I'm looking for advice on how to escalate this and come to a resolution.

**Top comments:**

* "Have you tried talking to her again and asking her to please smoke outside or in a well-ventilated area? Sometimes people don't realize the impact their habits have on others."
* "I would try to approach the situation in a non-confrontational way. Maybe send her a polite email or message explaining how the smell is affecting you and asking if there's anything she can do to minimize it. If that doesn't work, you could try talking to her in person again."
* "I would suggest talking to the building management or landlord about the issue. They may be able to help mediate the situation or provide guidance on how to address the problem."
* "I would also suggest considering the possibility that the smell is not just from pot, but also from other substances or chemicals that may be present in the air. It's possible that there's a more serious issue at play here."
* "Have you tried using an air purifier or opening windows to improve ventilation in your unit? Sometimes these simple solutions can help reduce the impact of unpleasant odors."
* "I would be careful about making assumptions about your neighbor's prescription and whether it's legitimate. It's possible that she has a valid prescription and is using the medication as directed. Instead of focusing on the prescription, try to focus on the impact her behavior is having on you and see if you can find a mutually beneficial solution."
* "I would suggest considering the possibility that you may need to take steps to protect your own health and well-being. If the smell is causing you significant distress or discomfort, it may be necessary to take action to address the issue, even if it means involving the police or building management."

TITLE: TIFU by not locking my phone

POST: It's the last day of the year. My family is quite big and most people live apart from each other. So for this year they decided to meet up at my grandmother's house: it's 21 people in a not so big house. I should mention most of them are also extremely right-wing, which made it hard for me to tell them I'm gay, so I kept postponing it.

I should mention that my phone keeps dimming the lights when I read, so I put the screen to dim at 10 minutes but to lock at 15. It's usually not a problem since I always lock it manually when I put it down.

Well, today I was sexting with my boyfriend on the bathroom. After a while I was super horny, so I threw my phone on the sink and went to take a quick shower. Once I finished it, I went to the room I was sharing with my cousin to put on some clothes.

Well, as you may have guessed, my phone was untouched long enough to dim the lights, but not enough to lock itself. My cousin took my phone and saw a bunch of dirty texts between me and my boyfriend.

And he told on me. He told on me hard.

They didn't say much to me, just a bunch of judgemental looks. I'm spending the night alone since it's too expensive to transfer my flight.

TL;DR: I TIFU by not locking my phone and my cousin saw my sexting conversations with my boyfriend, now I'm alone and humiliated.

TITLE: How to let go of a feeling that is just starting?

POST: Me (23 woman) dated a guy (29) a month ago. We didn't like each other at first sight, and I really can't remember the reason why we went out to the movies on the first place, but what I know is that after that day everything changed. 

I am really sceptic when it comes to love, cause I promised myself I would never feel again the unbearable pain of love rejection. He tried to hold my hand that day, I didn't let him (didn't feel right), the second time I saw him he tried to kiss me (didn't let him again).. that day wasn't even a date, we just saw each other casually on the street. So after that he stopped texting me.. I'm guessing he didn't like that conservative part about me... but come one.. it was only two times.. when a guy really likes you he makes an effort to see you again and earn your trust, your kisses.. 

So I realized the thing women never want to : " he just wasn't that into me".. and it was okay I was really good when it came to protect my heart.. but what I didn't know was this time I wouldn't be able to do so. I kept seeing him randomly and occasionally (cause I forgot to mention an important fact of the story: WE WORK TOGETHER). 

When we see each other at work it gets random at first, but at the end he keeps flirting with me.. it is so CONFUSING! Never been in this situation before, don't know how to react... And you guys don't need to tell me what I already now.. **HE DOES NOT WANT ANYTHING SERIOUS AND HE IS NOT THAT INTO ME**... so... why does he keep doing that? why does he keep trying to kiss me when none is looking? why does he touches my hands on purpose just to hold them for a short amount of time?

TL;DR: I dated a guy a month ago, we didn't click at first, but after that day everything changed. He stopped texting me, but still flirts with me at work, and I'm confused about why he keeps doing that. I know he's not interested in a serious relationship, but I don't know how to let go of these feelings.

TITLE: I (20m) need help. I acted extremely selfish and I hurt my girlfriend(20f) with my insecurity about our relationship.

POST: We have been long distance after almost a year of being together. Once we began long distance the relationship became ten times harder and I began to question myself if I could do this. 

This led to many many fights and every single one hurt my girlfriend more and more until last night when I poured my heart and realized so many things about myself, I realized how selfish I was to her. But it was too late, she said that she was just too hurt and couldn't be with me anymore. 

This broke my heart because the only person to blame is myself. I told her I'd wait and I'd have to prove to her that I am going to do this. I don't want to go out on weekends, I don't want to and meet women all I want to do is get on Skype lay in bed and read to her until she falls asleep. Why the fuck couldn't I have just done that before without pushing her away so far away. I was just so insecure about our relationship while she was just so sure about her feelings and about herself. I felt like she was falling from a cliff and I couldn't grab and pull her back.

I want to make her feel loved, every single day and every single second I'm not around. I'm not here to ask how to get her back. I'm here to ask how can I better myself and finally become a man. I want to become a man to make her feel safe at all times, to never be afraid of me and she always has someone to go to. She said I was supposed to be her person and as much as it breaks both our hearts, I wasn't. I want to be her person and her man. Not her boyfriend anymore.

How can I better myself for the good of our relationship?

TL;DR: I hurt my girlfriend with my insecurity and selfishness, and she broke up with me. I want to better myself to become a man she can feel safe with, not just her boyfriend.

**Comments:**

1. OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. It takes a lot of courage to admit your mistakes and take responsibility for them. You're on the right path by acknowledging your selfishness and wanting to change. Remember that it's not about being a "man" or a "person", it's about being a good partner and human being. Focus on self-reflection, self-improvement, and communication. You can't change the past, but you can work on being a better partner in the future.
2. OP, I think you're misunderstanding what it means to be a "man". Being a man isn't about being strong or dominant, it's about being vulnerable, empathetic, and responsible. You're already taking steps in the right direction by acknowledging your mistakes and wanting to change. Keep working on yourself, and don't be afraid to show your emotions. Your girlfriend may not be the right person for you, but you can still learn from the experience and grow as a person.
3. OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You can't become someone you're not overnight. Focus on small changes, like being more present in your daily life, being more open with your emotions, and being more supportive of your girlfriend. Don't try to change who you are to fit someone else's expectations. Be true to yourself and work on being a better partner.
4. OP, I think you're forgetting that your girlfriend is also a human being with her own feelings and needs. She may have been hurt by your actions, but she's also been hurt by the distance and the lack of communication. Try to understand her perspective and work on building a stronger connection with her. Don't focus solely on changing yourself, but also on improving your relationship.
5. OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're already taking responsibility for your actions and wanting to change. That's a huge step forward. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we learn from them that matters. Don't beat yourself up over it, but instead focus on moving forward and becoming a better person.

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP is taking responsibility for his actions and wanting to change to become a better partner and person.
* The comments are encouraging the OP to focus on self-reflection, self-improvement, and communication, rather than trying to change who he is to fit someone else's expectations.
* The OP is putting too much pressure on himself to become someone he's not overnight, and should focus on small changes and being true to himself.
* The OP should also try to understand his girlfriend's perspective and work on building a stronger connection with her.
* Everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we learn from them that matters. The OP should focus on moving forward and becoming a better person rather than beating himself up over his mistakes.

TITLE: Cat getting hot spots.

POST: Hey all. I'm calling all cat nutrition experts. 

My 7 year old orange shorthair developed a hot spot on her neck. Before I knew what a hot spot even was there was a running joke about how she would not know when to stop rubbing her head on stuff because she'd sometimes rub herself into a little scab. 

As far as I can remember she always would over do rubbing her head like that. It wasn't until recently she started rubbing that spot on her neck like that. 

We went to the vet to get her checked out. When I saw what she had done to herself I freaked the hell out. they sent us home with an ointment.

I didn't know that certain foods could cause a cat to start getting really itchy spots on them like that.

We have two cats. The 7 year old and a 13 year old. The 13 year old had never had any problems like this. I suspect that it has something to do with the 7 year old being a little undersized, maybe a runt. (she was also pretty undernourished when I found her 6 or so years ago trying to cross a busy street. Perhaps not the brightest.)

We feed both of our girls friskies prime fillets. mostly turkey or beef. They don't like fish too much. We used to feed them fancy feast but seemingly out of no where both of them decided they didn't want to eat it any more. We have meow mix hairball control dry food out for them. I feel like we've always fed them meow mix. 

Oh! Another thing. The two girls fight a bunch. It's never anything too out of control. They just both seem to love the same square of living room. When it gets too rough they usually cut it out or i'll intervene with a spray bottle of water. The older cat doesn't have her front claws but the younger one does. As a result the older one will nuzzle the younger cat to get her to cut it out. Could that be the reason? If so why the spots on the her ears. I've never seen the older cat go after those spots when they are playing. Again, the older cat hasn't had any issues like this. 

Anyway,

TL;DR: 7 year old cat got hot spots on her neck and ears. Vet gave us ointment. I'm trying to figure out why this happened. Any ideas? 

Thanks for your time.

P.S. I'll try to get some pictures of the hot spots. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a good shot of them. They're pretty small.

---

**Comments:**

* "Hot spots are usually caused by allergies or skin irritations. It's possible that your cat is allergic to something in her food or environment. Have you tried switching to a different food or using a humidifier in your home?"
* "I've heard that some cats can develop hot spots from excessive grooming. Maybe your cat is over-grooming due to stress or anxiety?"
* "It's possible that your cat is experiencing stress or anxiety due to the fighting with her sister. Maybe try giving her some calming treats or pheromone diffusers?"
* "I've seen cases where cats develop hot spots from flea allergies. Have you checked your cat for fleas?"
* "It's possible that your cat is experiencing a skin condition such as eczema or seborrhea. Maybe take her to a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
* "I've heard that some cats can develop hot spots from environmental factors such as pollen or dust. Maybe try using an air purifier in your home?"
* "It's possible that your cat is experiencing a reaction to something in her environment. Maybe try moving her to a different room or using a HEPA filter to remove allergens from the air."
* "I've seen cases where cats develop hot spots from over-bathing or using harsh shampoos. Maybe try using a gentle shampoo and conditioner on your cat?"
* "It's possible that your cat is experiencing a skin condition such as acne or cysts. Maybe take her to a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
* "I've heard that some cats can develop hot spots from hormonal imbalances. Maybe take your cat to a veterinarian for a check-up and blood work to rule out any underlying medical issues."

---

**TL;DR:** The OP is asking for advice on why their 7 year old cat developed hot spots on her neck and ears. They suspect it may be related to her food or environment, but are unsure. The comments suggest various possible causes, including allergies, stress, flea allergies, skin conditions, and environmental factors. The OP is encouraged to take their cat to a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

TITLE: Me [25/M] dealing with a group of friends ranging 19-24

POST: Hello there, r/Relationships,

I've got kind of a serious question that has been more or less wrecking my life in the last few weeks. I guess I'll start out with a quick back story. Started a study abroad program in January in Tokyo and have met some of the most wonderful people during the first 3 months of the program. We got along just fine and became fast friends. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, half the group has left while the remaining half is still here.

Here's the problem. While I had an interest in one or two girls in the group [ages 23-24] that had remained, it seems that their interests are on the other guys. Now, I never really voiced my interests for the sake of maintaining the status quo of the group, but I knew things were going on. I wanted to give them their space, but because of it, I've grown resentful.

As a result, I feel that they've become more exclusive to themselves and as such, I've told one of the people that I felt really close to my troubles. He says that no, it's not that they're trying to exclude me and that it's all in my head. There shouldn't be any problems between me and the group, but yet I still have that weird feeling that I shouldn't be treading in this territory. They do things on their own and yet, I feel that I'm more or less put on the wayside.

TL;DR: I'm 25, studying abroad in Tokyo, and have a group of friends ranging from 19-24. I've grown resentful because I never voiced my interests in the girls in the group, and now they're with other guys. I feel like they're excluding me, but my friend says it's all in my head.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, it's not uncommon to feel left out or resentful when you're not getting the attention you want. But, it's also important to remember that you're not entitled to anyone's attention or affection. Maybe try to focus on building relationships with the people who are actually interested in getting to know you better?"
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Oh, poor you, you didn't get the girls you wanted and now you're feeling left out. Newsflash: life isn't always about getting what you want. Maybe try to focus on being a good friend and not a try-hard?"
3. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I think you're being a bit unfair to your friends. Just because they're not interested in you romantically doesn't mean they don't value your friendship. Maybe try to have an open and honest conversation with them about how you're feeling?"
4. **RationalRuth**: "I think you're overthinking this. It's not uncommon for people to form close bonds with others in a group, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're excluding you. Maybe try to focus on building your own relationships and interests outside of the group?"
5. **Anonymous**: "I'm a girl in the group and I can confirm that we're not trying to exclude you. We're just trying to live our own lives and have our own relationships. Maybe try to be more understanding and less entitled?"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your comments! I guess I was expecting a lot of judgment, but instead, I got some really helpful advice. I think I was being a bit unfair to my friends, and I appreciate ConcernedCitizen's suggestion to have an open and honest conversation with them. I'll try to focus on being a good friend and not a try-hard. And RationalRuth, you're right, I should focus on building my own relationships and interests outside of the group. Thanks again, everyone!"

TITLE: Me [23 M] with a girl I've been dating [20 F] a 3 weeks, is telling me she has broken up with her old BF. But it appears she is lying.

POST: I am currently in college and I met this wonderful girl. We have gone on a few dates and everything appeared to be going great. She wanted to taking things quite slow because she was getting over a recent ex boyfriend.

However when I met her roommate she brought up that this girl has a boyfriend who has been acting rather shady towards her. He goes to another college and he has been spending the night "on the couch" at this other girls place frequently. He also has recently been posting on her wall and now I'm rather confused.

I know something is up but I really don't know how to handle this. I would really like to be straight forward with her but she seems dodgy whenever I do. I really am beginning to over think things and I almost feel like I was just there to shove in his face.

I really hate this situation because I feel like I could have a legitimate relationship with this girl.

TL;DR: I've been dating a girl for 3 weeks, she told me she's getting over her ex, but I found out she's still with him and he's been acting shady towards her. I don't know how to handle this and I feel like I'm just being used.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you gotta have a calm and honest conversation with her. Tell her you found out about her ex and how it's making you feel. Be clear and direct, but also be respectful. She might be lying to you, but she might also be going through a tough time and needs someone to talk to." (123 upvotes)
* "I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship. If she's still in contact with her ex and not being honest with you, it's a red flag. You deserve better than someone who's not being truthful with you." (56 upvotes)
* "Have you tried asking her directly if she's still with her ex? Sometimes people get caught up in their own emotions and don't realize how their actions are affecting others. If she's still with him, it's not fair to you and you should consider moving on." (34 upvotes)
* "I would say be careful not to jump to conclusions. Maybe she's not lying, maybe she's just not ready to admit it to herself or to you. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her and see how she reacts. If she's still with her ex, it might be a sign that she's not ready for a new relationship." (21 upvotes)
* "I think you should take a break from the relationship and focus on yourself. You deserve someone who is honest and upfront with you. Don't waste your time on someone who is still in contact with their ex." (15 upvotes)

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice guys. I think I'm going to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. I don't want to be in a situation where I'm not being honest with myself or with her. I'll try to have an open and honest conversation with her and see how she reacts. If she's still with her ex, I think I'll have to move on. Thanks again for the advice, it's really helped me clear my head." (123 upvotes)

TITLE: My boyfriend waits too long in between our sexual encounters. (both 30)

POST: Together 2 years. 

We have sex like, once every 2 weeks. Tops. We used to do it more often. I try to initiate and it goes nowhere so I drop the subject. When he initiates though, he gets super butt hurt when I am not interested.

It's been 3 weeks at this point. For the past two weeks I've been trying to seduce him. It wasn't working, so I stopped all sexual things and just gave him non-sexual physical attention and taking care of my orgasms on my own. 

Yesterday he wants to get busy. At that point, I'm not even interested. After being turned down for weeks I become indifferent. Then, we have sex and it starts all over again. I get excited, try to initiate, get turned down, and as soon as I'm "over it" he wants to go again. I've tried just NOT initiating at all (maybe the chase turns him on) and that doesn't work either. 

What the fuck can I do here? Yes I have talked to him about it only to hear "I'm sorry, I'll work on it"

TL;DR: Boyfriend waits too long between sexual encounters, gets upset when I'm not interested, and I'm tired of the cycle. Help!

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like he's not respecting your boundaries and needs. You need to have a serious conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting you. Tell him that you need a more consistent and respectful approach to your sex life. If he's not willing to work on it, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Girl, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before. You need to set some boundaries and communicate them clearly. Tell him that you need a minimum of once a week, and if he can't commit to that, then you need to reevaluate the relationship. Don't be afraid to walk away if he's not willing to work on it."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think there's a bigger issue here. It sounds like your boyfriend is not prioritizing your needs and desires. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to have sex with you regularly. I would suggest taking a step back and reevaluating the relationship as a whole. Are there other areas where he's not meeting your needs?"
4. **u/its_all_good**: "I think you're being a bit too harsh. Maybe he's just going through a tough time or has some personal issues that are affecting his libido. Have you tried talking to him about it in a non-accusatory way? Maybe he's not even aware of how his behavior is affecting you. Try to have a conversation with him and see if you can work through this together."
5. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Is this the only issue in your relationship? Are there other areas where you're not feeling fulfilled? Maybe this is just a symptom of a deeper problem. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on your feelings and desires, and then have a conversation with your boyfriend about what you need from the relationship."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is feeling frustrated and disrespected by their boyfriend's lack of initiative in their sex life.
* The boyfriend gets upset when the OP is not interested in sex, and the OP feels like they're being taken advantage of.
* The OP has tried various approaches to initiate sex, including seduction and non-sexual physical attention, but nothing seems to work.
* The boyfriend has apologized and promised to work on it, but the OP is skeptical and feels like nothing will change.
* The comments suggest that the OP needs to have a serious conversation with their boyfriend about their needs and boundaries, and that they may need to reevaluate the relationship if the boyfriend is not willing to work on it. Some commenters also suggest that the OP should take a step back and look at the bigger picture, considering whether this is the only issue in the relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by letting my dog into the front yard

POST: Happened 2 hours ago. Moving out tomorrow morning so I emptied my water bed water of 10 years into the back yard. Didn't want the dogs messing with that nasty water so I let them out front. Baily, the adventurous one, decided to chase a skunk. Now I'm moving to a new place tomorrow and new people are moving into my place tomorrow and I'm trying to make my house and dog not smell like skunk. Best part is I had already moved most of my stuff out so I had to run to wall greens and buy soap baking soda and hydrogen peroxide because I guess its the magic concoction.

TL;DR: Let my dog out front, she chased a skunk, now my house and dog smell like skunk, and I have to move out tomorrow.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "improve" my roommate's cooking

POST: So I've been living with my roommate for a few months now, and while I appreciate her efforts in the kitchen, I just can't help but think that her cooking is... subpar. I mean, I've tried to give her constructive feedback, but she just gets defensive and tells me to "respect her cooking". So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and "improve" her dishes. I started adding my own secret ingredients, adjusting the seasoning, and even rearranging the presentation. At first, it seemed like a good idea, but things quickly took a turn for the worse. She came home to find that I had not only changed her recipe, but also cleaned out her entire pantry and fridge, leaving her with nothing to cook with. She was furious, and rightfully so. I tried to apologize and explain that I was just trying to help, but she's still really upset with me. I guess I learned that sometimes it's better to just let people do their own thing, even if it's not exactly what I would do.

TL;DR: Tried to "improve" my roommate's cooking by adding my own ingredients and rearranging the presentation, but ended up cleaning out her pantry and fridge and causing a huge argument. Lesson learned: respect people's cooking and boundaries.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "help" my friend with her car

POST: So my friend was having some issues with her car, and I offered to help her fix it. I've had some experience with cars, so I thought I could lend a hand. Big mistake. I ended up stripping the threads on the spark plug, breaking the timing belt, and somehow managing to get the oil all over the garage floor. My friend was understandably upset, and I felt like a total idiot. To make matters worse, I had to call a tow truck to take the car to the shop, and now I'm on the hook for the bill. I guess I learned that sometimes it's better to just let professionals handle things, especially when it comes to complex tasks like car repairs. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? How did you recover from it?

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "improve" my coworker's presentation

POST: So I was at work and my coworker was preparing a presentation for a meeting. I thought I could help her out by "improving" it, so I took it upon myself to make some changes. I added some fancy graphics, rearranged the slides, and even changed the font. I thought I was doing her a favor, but it turns out she had a very specific vision for the presentation and my changes completely ruined it. She was furious and felt like I had disrespected her work. I tried to apologize and explain that I was just trying to help, but she was having none of it. I ended up getting in trouble with our boss for "meddling" in someone else's work. I guess I learned that sometimes it's better to just let people do their own thing, especially when it comes to creative projects like presentations. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? How did you recover from it?

TL;DR: Tried to "improve" my coworker's presentation by making changes, but ended up ruining it and getting in trouble with our boss. Lesson learned: respect people's work and boundaries. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? How did you recover from it? SUBREDDIT: r/tifu

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "help" my neighbor with her yard work

POST: So my neighbor was struggling to mow her lawn, so I offered to help her out. I thought I was being a good neighbor, but things quickly went awry. I ended up breaking the lawn mower, damaging the fence, and even knocking over a few plants. My neighbor was understandably upset, and I felt like a total idiot. To make matters worse, I had to apologize to her and offer to help her fix the damage. I guess I learned that sometimes it's better to just let people do their own thing, especially when it comes to tasks like yard work. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? How did you recover from it?

TITLE: Me [25 F] with my husband [26M] 6 years, found out he had been sexting with an old co-worker of his before we got engaged, need advice

POST: Hi, I've never done anything like this before...like at all. So I'm not even sure if I'm doing this right, didn't realize there would be a list of rules to read!But I've heard from friends that these things can be helpful, so I'm giving it a try.

Long story short, my husband of 1 month now, have been together 6 years. We have been through many ups and downs, and have been very open with each other and have really grown in our relationship. Which is a big reason why we got married.

A few days ago I found naked pictures of a girl he used to work with on his phone. They were from 2 years ago, and the date suggested about 3 months before he proposed to me.

First I know it was stupid of me to even be looking on his phone, though I wasn't looking for him cheating. Just something that is irrelevant to this problem now. But feel free to speak openly about this to me as well.

Second, I have confronted him and he has told me in phases about what happened. Though my concern is that he's not being fully honest with me or him self, because he's answered a lot of my questions with something like "I'm not sure, it was a long time ago" or "To the best of my knowledge, this is what happened." He said it was a time in our relationship when he wasn't sure where we were going, and we weren't really having a lot sex. But honestly, he never clued me in on that time in our relationship much, especially since he proposed only months later. He said he knew it was wrong immediately and feels so guilty. But he kept those pictures, and I know he never stopped his friendship with her. 

Now we're only a month into our marriage, and I'm worried about how we're going to deal with this...how I'm going to deal with this!

TL;DR: Found naked pictures of an old co-worker on my husband's phone, he sexted with her before we got engaged, he says he knew it was wrong and feels guilty, but I'm worried about his honesty and how we'll move forward.

TITLE: Reddit, what is the weirdest thing you have seen on the subway?

POST: I got the idea from another thread in here where someone claimed that the NYC subway wasn't that bad. One day, I was headed into the city to go see one of my favorite punk bands at the time. In order to get to the venue, we had to take a train downtown. While some of my friends and I were sitting on a train, I hear a woman scream and a group of people immediately walk towards the other side of the train with looks of disgust. Now, I focus my head to see what could be so bad, and it's a homeless guy. Someone else on the train is helping him on and yelling "this is a human being, i was like this man once, etc." I couldn't figure out why these people would react this way towards a homeless person. Out of nowhere my friend yells "fuck this" and runs off the train. That is when the smell of puss and infection hits me like a cockslap from Zeus. The man's foot was swollen to the size of a basketball and discolored if not rotting. Now, besides the smell and the sight, what really does it is the fact that something in his foot has popped and he is leaving a heavy trail of some brownish blood all over the train.

TL;DR: I saw a homeless guy with a rotting foot on the subway and people were helping him, but then my friend freaked out and ran away.

TITLE: I [19F] have no idea how to read the situation with guys I like, or even ones I want to be friends with

POST: I just became a university student a couple months ago, and due to distance, my long term boyfriend of 2 years and I broke up. I'm pretty introverted, so he was my only friend, and he held a grudge. So here I am, introverted and alone in a STEM school which is guy-dominant, and I don't know how to interact with them. I really think it would be good for me to get out there again, but I've never been good at making friends, let alone the whole dating scene.

I joined a few clubs at the beginning of last semester, and met a group of three guy friends[all 20/M] who live together, and do everything together. I feel comfortable enough around them now, but still get nervous even asking them to hang out, because I get paranoid that I'm a nuisance. I want to become closer friends with all of them, but don't know how to go about doing that.

In particular, one of them I can't help being drawn to. He's extremely passionate, and talented, and just amazing to talk to, and he and I are a lot alike. He's not the kind of guy I usually go for, and I'm not sure what it is about him that makes him stick in my mind so much, but I can't help thinking about him. 

My problem is that he also got out of a long term relationship recently, I don't know how to get him alone without scaring him off, and I'm pretty sure he just sees me as one of the guys. One minute he'll be really honest, and be having a pretty deep conversation with me, and the next, he's laughing it up about some joke he made at my expense. 

Any advice at all would make me very happy.

TL;DR: I'm a 19F who's struggling to make friends and navigate the dating scene after a long term breakup. I've met a group of guy friends, but one of them I'm really drawn to, but I don't know how to get closer to him without scaring him off.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm a guy and I've been in similar situations before. First of all, it's awesome that you're taking the initiative to get out there and make friends. It's normal to feel nervous, but don't let that stop you. As for the guy you're interested in, I think it's great that you're drawn to him. Just remember that he's going through a tough time after his breakup, so be patient and understanding. Don't try to force anything, just focus on building a genuine connection with him. And honestly, if he doesn't feel the same way, that's okay too. You deserve someone who is interested in you for who you are."

TITLE: My ex-girlfriend [21] broke up with me a few weeks ago, yet still wants to hangout with me [22] every day.

POST: Hey all, I just recently was on the receiving end of my first breakup. After about five months I was told the reasoning was chemistry and her not being over her old boyfriend. The breakup wasn't dramatic, and she moved out shortly thereafter; however, she still keeps in contact with me via text in the mornings / nights, and I see her at least once or twice a day. She knows full well how I feel about her, and how I am still in love with her, but I can't tell if she's flipped the switch and "friendzoned" me that quickly or not.

I'm all for giving her space to do her own thing, and figure out her own issues... however, I can't help but feel a sting whenever we part without so much as a hug. Being the schlep that I am, I would still do anything for her and keep her as company for as long as possible (unless she started to date somebody else).

I guess I would just like to know if it's possible to rekindle the romance, or if she is just looking for the chase again.

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago, still wants to hangout with me daily, unsure if she's friendzoned me or not.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're still in love with her, but you're also still giving her space and being a good friend. That's really admirable. If she's not interested in rekindling the romance, then it's okay to accept that and move on. But if you're feeling like you're stuck in limbo, maybe have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Be prepared for any outcome, though."
* "I think you're being too nice. You deserve better than someone who can't make up their mind. If she's not willing to commit to you, then it's time to move on. You're not going to find someone who's going to treat you like you deserve if you keep holding on to someone who's not interested."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. But also be prepared for the possibility that she's just not interested in rekindling the romance. It's okay to accept that and move on. You can't force someone to feel a certain way, and you deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you."
* "I think you're being too focused on the romance aspect. Maybe she's just looking for a friend right now, and that's okay. You can still be friends with someone even if it's not romantic. Just make sure you're not leading her on or giving her false hope."
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your feelings. Are you really still in love with her, or are you just holding on to the idea of being with her? You deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you, and you shouldn't settle for someone who is just using you as a friend."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys. I think I'm going to take a step back and reevaluate my feelings. I know I'm still in love with her, but I also know that I deserve someone who is genuinely interested in me. I'm going to try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how I'm feeling, and see where it takes us. Thanks again for your input!"

TITLE: My brother thinks entitled to a car

POST: He's been asking for a car from my parents, punching and making holes on the walls for years. Problem is, we can't afford one right now. We're struggling to pay bills. If he wanted a car, he should work for it. In the past month, my mom took a house keeping job just to keep up with day-to-day living. Instead, she poured all that money to get a car. The car was a non-op, used car (it ran, it just didn't have smog clearance yet, so we can't get it registered and insured yet). It's been a week sitting in our garage. Today, he just raised voice on mom telling her to shut her mouth because she's not letting him use the used car. My mom's reasoning was it's uninsured and failed smog test but he kept arguing that he won't get caught or get in trouble. Again, my mom can't afford to fix it yet. She just bought the car a week ago! He said he's been walking for miles and riding the bus just to get to school but not really. He gets dropped to school M-F everyday, and picked up from his friends house after school (3-4 of the 5 days). He doesn't realize my mom looking up for him and all he does is raise his voice and argue his false points. He thinks he's entitled to a car because he's 17.

He thinks it's bad. I'm 21, have a job, and still does not own a car. I go to a community college and wake up at 4AM, ride 2-3 buses just to get to school. Going back home is another 2-3 buses. All the money that I earn, I pay the house bills.

TL;DR: My 17-year-old brother thinks he's entitled to a car from my parents, despite us struggling to pay bills. He's been asking for years, punching and making holes in the walls. My mom just bought a used car, but it's uninsured and failed smog test. He's not willing to listen to reason and thinks he's entitled to it.

---

**Comments:**

* "Your brother sounds like a real piece of work. I'm glad you're standing up for your mom and not enabling his entitled behavior."
* "I'm 19 and I still don't own a car. I work part-time and go to school full-time. Your brother needs to learn the value of hard work and responsibility."
* "I feel for your mom, she's trying to make ends meet and your brother is just being a brat. You're right, he needs to work for it."
* "I'm surprised your mom didn't just give in and get him a car. I would have, but I'm glad she's standing firm."
* "Your brother needs to learn that life isn't fair and sometimes you have to make sacrifices. He's not entitled to a car just because he's 17."
* "I'm glad you're speaking up for your mom. It's not fair that your brother is being so entitled and not considering the struggles your family is going through."
* "Your brother sounds like a spoiled brat. I'm glad you're not enabling his behavior and are standing up for your mom."
* "I think your mom should have a talk with your brother about the value of hard work and responsibility. Maybe he'll learn to appreciate what he has and not take things for granted."
* "I'm surprised your brother is still living at home. Maybe he should get a part-time job and start contributing to the household expenses."
* "Your brother needs to learn that life is not about getting what you want, when you want it. He needs to learn to make sacrifices and work for what he wants."

TITLE: Reddit: What Queued Your Worst "Late to the Party" Feeling?

POST: I'm a twenty-four year old white male and this past Summer met my father for the first time as an adult; from him, I learned my father was addicted to methamphetamines during the period he impregnated my mother, probably until he left our lives. She herself was addicted to crack during the whole 9month period and evidently was until I was around seventeen. We've oft been isolated by people who got to know my mother; family members, people who she gets to be friends with, neighbors, and were shunned due to this and I never really understood why.
She's never had close friends, relationships, rarely had let me out of the house, would get mad if I tried speaking with her, barely ate and thus had barely food in the house. I was made to follow this path.
She is such a sweet person, I never knew anything was off with all of this and even though I have been out of the house since nineteen, it took two years to start seeing how exactly all of that was bad and the adverse effects it had on my person. 
I recall a time making fun of crack babies in high school; looks like the jokes on me, hurr hurr.
Also, since this revelation I have been much more tolerant of people who have been intentionally indoctrinated considering my unintentional indoctrination. It's hard to know more than what you know sometimes.

TL;DR: I just found out my mom was addicted to crack during my childhood and my dad was addicted to meth. I'm trying to process and understand why people shunned us and why my mom was so isolated. I'm also trying to be more understanding of people who have been intentionally indoctrinated.

TITLE: Men and Women of the military (past and present), what are some of the most ridiculous methods used, that you have seen or heard, to get out of the military?

POST: In recruit training, SanDiego, 2 males in my platoon were found giving/receiving oral to each other intentionally during our shower time.  Whether the two were legitimately homosexual or not is out of the question because there was no discreetness about the act whatsoever.  We had 3 shower rooms and they had left a couple minutes before everyone else to take their shower.  Fastforward a couple of minutes and there out in the open are the two guys giving each other fellatio for everyone to see.  Here is the best part about it all...instead of kicking the 2 out of the Marine Corps like they wanted...The drill instructor told them that they were both getting a 1 way ticket into the navy where they could perform these kind of acts where it is deemed normal.....(this is what was said, not in any way a hit to the navy).

So Reddit, do you have any similar stories that you have heard of or personally saw?

TITLE: TIFU by eating spicy chips

POST: This happened about twenty minutes ago. Let me start off by saying that I am a male in high school and enjoy self pleasure. So I am watching Doctor Who and the urge comes to me. I was eating takis at the time. For those of you who don't know, takis are a really delicious tortilla chip with a LOT of chile and lime seasoning. So I go at it not realizing what was on my hand for about 30 seconds. Pain kicked in and I had no idea what to do so I took my water bottle (luckily right next to me) and apply water onto my boys. Pain gradually subsided however still stings a bit.

TL;DR: I ate spicy chips while self-pleasuring and didn't realize it until it was too late. I applied water to my hand and it's still a bit sore.

TITLE: Me [18F] and boyfriend [24M] are having problems with our sex life.

POST: Our sexlife has been normal for the first 5-6 months. We had sex like every day and it was good. 
But since I got that birth control shot I don't feel like having sex that often. And I felt really bad and tired the last few weeks.
So I understand it seems like I'm making excuses but that's not what happens. 
So anyways. The last time we had sex is 4 days ago. And he says we only had "good sex" twice since 2 weeks.
I really am sorry for it but there's just no feeling of having sex sometimes. He keeps asking me why I couldn't just let him try to make me horny but it's not about the being horny part it's about that I don't even want to be horny.
We had two fights about it since yesterday cause he thinks I'm controlling our sex life which is kind of true but what's so bad about doing what I feel like and telling him if I don't want something. 
He was yelling at me and I kept saying that I'm sorry but apparently he didn't hear it.
He said he wouldn't even want it anymore and just left the house.
I was planning on having sex with him, just like yesterday, but not like this, it just makes me want to leave.
Help.

TL;DR: Me and boyfriend have been having problems with our sex life. I got a birth control shot and don't feel like having sex as often. He's upset and thinks I'm controlling our sex life. We had two fights and he left the house. I'm feeling really bad and don't know what to do.

RESPONSES:

* "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated. Can you try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling? Maybe you can explain to him that you're not trying to control the sex life, but rather you're just not feeling it right now. It might be helpful to set some boundaries and communicate your needs to each other. Remember that it's okay to say no and prioritize your own feelings and desires. You deserve to be heard and respected in your relationship."
* "OP, I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and being honest with your boyfriend. It's not uncommon for people to go through periods where they don't feel like having sex as much, especially with hormonal changes. Maybe you can try to find other ways to connect with your boyfriend that don't involve sex, like cuddling, watching a movie together, or going for a walk. It might help to build intimacy and closeness without the pressure of sex. Also, have you considered talking to your doctor about the birth control shot and how it's affecting your libido? They might be able to offer some advice or adjust your dosage."
* "OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated. I think it's important to remember that sex is just one part of a relationship, and it's not the only way to connect with each other. Maybe you can try to focus on other aspects of your relationship, like your shared interests, hobbies, or goals. It might help to build a stronger bond and connection with your boyfriend. Also, have you considered couples therapy? It might be helpful to work through your issues and communicate more effectively with each other."

TITLE: Reddit, I have a totally irrational fear... How do I pull myself out?

POST: I have this fear of being murdered, in my own home, but it goes well beyond that. It all started when my car was broken into, in my own drive way. My laptop, radar detector, GPS, system, amp & sub were all taken from my car in the middle of the night. I really felt stupid for leaving my things in my car, in plain view. Following the incident, I would go outside on the back porch to smoke and almost immediately have a panic attack. I'm usually up until 4 - 5AM, so it was quite dark when I'd go out. One of my dogs would usually go out with me and she would bark at shadows. That's what triggered it. Even with every landscape light & the lights from my porch on, I'd panic at the thought of what I couldn't see beyond the lit areas. I'd race inside, usually throwing my cigarette to the ground while flailing my arms about & slam the door. From that point on, I'd have to constantly make sure the doors were locked. Every light in my house had to be on. I'd make sure my dogs are awake & alert. I'd usually wake the next morning in the recliner in my bedroom, sometimes with a knife (which I now sleep with close by). 

*NOW*, I have quit smoking. I thought that would help and it did for a few days. Unfortunately, I still freak out, every single night. I cannot be home at night without every light in my house on, in a complete panic. It's even gotten to the point that I grab all four of my dogs & stay at a friends house quite frequently. Should I seek therapy for something like this? Any home remedies for curing this kind of fear?

TL;DR: I have an irrational fear of being murdered in my own home, triggered by a car break-in and my dog barking at shadows. I'm looking for advice on how to overcome this fear and if therapy is necessary.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're not alone. I have a similar fear, but it's more about being trapped in a small space. I've found that talking to someone about it helps a lot. Consider reaching out to a therapist or a trusted friend/family member. They can help you work through your fears and develop coping mechanisms. Also, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of worrying about being murdered, think about what you can do to make your home safer. Install security cameras, get a dog, etc."
2. **u/irishguy88**: "I think you should definitely seek therapy for this. It's not normal to have such a strong fear of being murdered in your own home. A therapist can help you identify the root cause of your fear and work with you to develop strategies to overcome it. In the meantime, try to focus on the things that are within your control. Make sure your home is secure, get a security system, etc. And try to practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help calm your nerves."
3. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I'm not a therapist, but I've had similar fears in the past. I found that writing down my fears and worries helped me to process them and feel more in control. Try keeping a journal or writing down your fears and what triggers them. You might also try to challenge your thoughts by asking yourself if there's any evidence to support your fears. For example, is there any evidence that you're more likely to be murdered in your own home than anywhere else? Sometimes, facing our fears head-on can help us to overcome them."
4. **u/throwawayaccount456**: "I think you should try to confront your fears head-on. Instead of avoiding your home at night, try to stay in it and focus on the things that are within your control. Make sure your doors and windows are locked, get a security system, etc. You might also try to practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help calm your nerves. And if you're feeling overwhelmed, don't be afraid to reach out to a friend or family member for support."

TITLE: From a 678 to a 615 in six weeks?

POST: I recently shopped around and went to a dealership to see what kind of financing I could get for a vehicle on their lot that I really liked and thought I could get a good deal out of. I requested a $10,000 loan.

The way my credit was at the time, I had 100% on time payments with a 12 month credit history of payments, I also had a new line from Best Buy credit that has been going two months now. Prior to this loan request, I had a 678 score. 

Shortly after talking with the dealer and running my credit, I decide that I'm not financially set enough to be buying a car. To add insult to injury, I find out over the next couple weeks that they contacted 18 various banks and credit unions for financing...all denying my loan. I would read each letter stating the reasons for denial and seeing my score drop... 658...647...630...625...and now finally 615 where I'm at the end of the inquiries. During this time, I managed to miss ONE payment from Best Buy which resulted in a single interest charge and double payment that I caught up on the next month. I am current on the payment of that now. 

I also applied for a credit card and I believe I was approved (since it was through my current bank) and I should be receiving one next week.

TL;DR: I went to a dealership, got denied for a car loan, and my credit score dropped from 678 to 615 in six weeks. I missed one payment, and I'm currently trying to rebuild my credit.

QUESTIONS:

1. How can I rebuild my credit?
2. Should I close my Best Buy credit account?
3. How can I avoid future credit score drops?

ANSWERS:

1. Rebuilding credit: You can rebuild your credit by making on-time payments, keeping credit utilization low, and monitoring your credit report for errors. Consider becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit account or applying for a secured credit card to help improve your credit score.

2. Closing Best Buy credit account: It's generally a good idea to keep credit accounts open and in good standing, as this can help your credit utilization ratio and credit history. However, if you're not using the account and it's not helping your credit, you might consider closing it. Make sure to pay off any outstanding balance before closing the account.

3. Avoiding future credit score drops: To avoid future credit score drops, make sure to monitor your credit report regularly, keep credit inquiries to a minimum, and avoid applying for too many credit products at once. You can also consider setting up credit score monitoring services to alert you to any changes in your credit score.

ADDITIONAL TIPS:

* Consider working with a credit counselor or financial advisor to help you develop a personalized plan for rebuilding your credit.
* Make sure to pay your bills on time and keep your credit utilization ratio low to avoid negative marks on your credit report.
* Avoid applying for too many credit products at once, as this can result in multiple hard inquiries on your credit report.
* Consider becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit account or applying for a secured credit card to help improve your credit score.
* Keep your credit report up to date and accurate by monitoring it regularly and disputing any errors you find.

TITLE: [16/f] deciding whether to stay at home unhappily or risk living with boyfriend (19/m) which might not be the best financially/might cause parents emotional pain

POST: Me and boyfriend (Lets call him R) have been together almost 2 years and I am seriously planning on moving in with him when I turn 18. 
BUT, I was raised in a Christian home and dont want my Christian mom to feel like a failure with me moving in (and of course breaking the marital sex rule) being not very Christian-like. It hurt my mom when both my older sisters moved out at 18, but they were different situations. They both disliked my mom because of spoiled and entitled personalities even though my mom did everything they could to give them a good life. So my mom feels like a failure with both kids hating them when they moved out and one of them heavily getting into drugs right before she moved out. I have a theory that she views me and my younger brother by two years as the good, successful kids, since we were from her current husband and not her asshole ex-husband. And we didn't get pregnant at 18 or get into drugs.
I have no hard feelings towards both of my parents, I just want to become independent and live with R. Thats where I'd feel happiest and if this didn't go through then I'd feel resent towards my parents for holding me back. 
For backstory, R wants to be a psychologist and is getting his Associates degree in accounting so while going to school for psychology will earn good money as an accountant. He's mature, logical and understandable. I don't think there's any risk in that area. He's a freshman in community college now, hes not a bum.
His mom I've talked to this about and she made a goo point saying "If you keep trying to make them happy instead of *myself* happy then I'll never be truly happy.
*I also haven't told my parents about my plans and they think I'm staying at home through college.
But this is a huge decision and I want as many opinions as possible. I've asked teachers, my two cleaned up older siblings and R's mom. But you can never have too many second opinions on a serious and life changing decision.

TL;DR: I'm 16 and planning to move in with my 19-year-old boyfriend when I turn 18. I'm worried about my Christian mom's feelings and potential emotional pain. I want to be independent and happy, but I also don't want to hurt my mom. Should I stay at home unhappily or take the risk and potentially cause my parents emotional pain?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not your responsibility to make your parents happy. You're an adult, and you should prioritize your own happiness. If you're happy with R, then that's what matters. You can always have open and honest conversations with your parents about your decision, and they may surprise you by being more understanding than you think."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your parents' feelings, but you also need to think about your own feelings and what's best for you. Have you talked to your parents about your plans and how they might feel? Maybe they're more open to the idea than you think."
* "I'm a Christian too, and I think it's important to remember that God wants us to be happy and fulfilled. If living with R makes you happy, then that's what God wants for you. You don't have to feel guilty about making a decision that's best for you."
* "I think you should consider the long-term consequences of your decision. Are you prepared to deal with the potential fallout if your parents are upset? Are you prepared to take on the responsibilities of living with someone else, especially at such a young age?"
* "I'm a bit concerned that you're basing your decision on what your parents might think. You should be thinking about what's best for you, not what your parents might want. Have you considered what your parents might think if you're unhappy living with R and regret your decision?"
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your parents' feelings, but you also need to think about your own feelings and what's best for you. Have you talked to R about your concerns and how he might be able to support you through this decision?"
* "I'm a bit concerned that you're putting too much pressure on yourself to make your parents happy. You can't control how your parents feel, but you can control how you feel. If you're happy with R, then that's what matters. You don't have to feel guilty about making a decision that's best for you."
* "I think you should consider seeking counseling or talking to a trusted adult about your concerns. They can help you work through your feelings and make a decision that's best for you."
* "I'm a bit concerned that you're not considering the potential risks of living with someone at such a young age. Have you thought about how you'll handle conflicts or disagreements with R? Have you thought about how you'll handle financial responsibilities and other adult tasks?"
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your parents' feelings, but you also need to think about your own feelings and what's best for you. Have you talked to R about your concerns and how he might be able to support you through this decision?"

**Note:** The comments are a mix of advice, concerns, and questions, and some users are more supportive of the OP's decision to move in with her boyfriend, while others are more cautious and suggest considering the potential risks and consequences. Some users also encourage the OP to have open and honest conversations with her parents about her plans and feelings. Overall, the comments provide a range of perspectives and advice for the OP to consider as she makes her decision.

TITLE: Reddit, my mother stole money from me to ruin my family. What do I do?

POST: Repost because the last one got caught in the spam filter.

So, in February of 2010 when I was 16-17, I was the victim of a screwup at the pharmacy, which landed me in the hospital for about 4 days. I received a decent amount of money for a settlement for the screwup, and it was placed in a bank account with my mom's name on it, to be transfered to me when I turned 18. Starting in January, before my 18th birthday in March, my mother started behaving very nastily towards my father, and eventually filed a restraining order, saying he had become "violent," and "kicked in her door." I never saw any of this. He never raised a hand towards her, even though they argued frequently. He had been sleeping in the garage in the winter to avoid upsetting her, and was asking to sleep in the house. Turns out, she withdrew almost $5000 from my settlement money, to be used for college, to put a down payment on a divorce lawyer the next Monday. Now she's saying to the court that it was a "loan," even though I wasn't even aware of it until months later. I think I'm going to press charges, but I figured I'd ask what everyone else thinks. Theres a lot more to the story I'm probably missing, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

TL;DR: My mom stole $5000 from my settlement money, claiming it was a "loan," and is now using it to fund her divorce lawyer. I'm 18 now, and I'm considering pressing charges. What do I do?

---

This post is a great example of the kind of complex, emotionally charged situations that can arise in real life. The OP (original poster) is seeking advice on how to handle a difficult situation with their mother, who has stolen money from them and is now using it to fund her divorce lawyer. The post is well-written and provides a lot of context, making it easy for readers to understand the situation and offer helpful advice.

The post also raises some interesting questions about the relationship between the OP and their mother, and how the OP can navigate this difficult situation. For example, the OP may need to consider whether to press charges against their mother, and how to deal with the emotional fallout of this situation.

Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of real-life issues that can be discussed on Reddit, and how the community can come together to offer support and advice.

TITLE: I [20f] was rejected for saying "I love you" and am feeling a little low. How can I look at my situation in a more positive light?

POST: I [20f] have been with my boyfriend [21m] for six months. He's incredible, it's the best relationship I've ever had, and I love him. But, he doesn't feel the same way, and admits to being afraid to think that way because he's graduating at the end of the year and most likely will be leaving me.

I've had guys say they love me and then take it back, so I appreciate his honesty. Unfortunately, the logical part of my head doesn't control my tear ducts.

Admittedly, I really had my hopes up that he'd be saying "I love you" soon. I was looking for something to differentiate me from the other girls he knows. My boyfriend has a lot of female friends, and he's extremely affectionate with all of them. He practically dates them all  - takes them on one-on-one outings and stays up all night with them when  they're going through a rough time. He's a good friend, and I love that about him.

But on the other hand, I feel like the only thing that sets me apart from his friends is that he fucks me. And that doesn't feel so great.

So how can I look at this differently?

TL;DR: I said "I love you" to my boyfriend, and he rejected me, saying he's afraid to think that way because he's graduating soon and will likely be leaving me. I'm feeling down and want to look at the situation in a more positive light.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're feeling down. It's understandable, but try not to focus on the fact that he doesn't say "I love you" back. Instead, think about all the amazing qualities he has as a partner and friend. He's affectionate, supportive, and genuinely cares about you. Those are things that are hard to find in a partner, and you should be grateful for that.

Also, don't compare yourself to his other friends. You're in a relationship with him, and that's different. He's committed to you in a way that he isn't with his friends. Remember that you're not just a friend to him, you're his partner.

Lastly, try not to tie your self-worth to his feelings. You are so much more than whether or not he says "I love you" back. You're an amazing person with so much to offer, and you deserve to be loved and respected regardless of his feelings.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I feel for you. It's tough to hear that someone you care about doesn't feel the same way. But try to see this as an opportunity to focus on yourself and your own happiness. You deserve to be loved and respected, and you don't need someone else's validation to feel worthy.

Take some time to reflect on what you want from your relationship and what you're willing to accept. Are you okay with being in a relationship where he's not emotionally available? Or do you need someone who can give you the love and attention you deserve?

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are plenty of people out there who will love and respect you for who you are. Don't give up on yourself, and don't settle for anything less than what you deserve.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. You're focusing on the fact that he doesn't say "I love you" back, but that doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. Maybe he's just not ready to say those words yet, or maybe he's scared of getting hurt. Either way, it's not a reflection of your worth as a person.

Try to see this as a chance to grow and learn more about yourself. What do you want from your relationship? What are your non-negotiables? Use this experience to figure out what you need and want, and don't settle for anything less.

And hey, who knows? Maybe he'll come around eventually and realize how amazing you are. But even if he doesn't, you'll be better off for having learned and grown from this experience. 

COMMENT 4:
OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's tough to hear that someone you care about doesn't feel the same way. But try to remember that you're not defined by his feelings. You are so much more than whether or not he says "I love you" back.

Take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. Do things that make you happy, surround yourself with people who support and love you, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there and take risks. You never know what amazing things might come your way.

And hey, who knows? Maybe he'll come around eventually and realize how amazing you are. But even if he doesn't, you'll be better off for having learned and grown from this experience. 

COMMENT 5:
OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on the fact that he doesn't say "I love you" back. Instead, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. What are some things that he does that make you happy? What are some things that you appreciate about him?

Remember, relationships are about give and take. It's not always about getting what you want, but about finding common ground and working together. Try to focus on the good things about your relationship and the things that make you happy, rather than dwelling on the negative.

And hey, who knows? Maybe he'll come around eventually and realize how amazing you are. But even if he doesn't, you'll be better off for having learned and grown from this experience.

TITLE: Unsure if new relationship will work out, need advice

POST: (I'm 15M she's 14F) So I started dating this girl 3 weeks ago, and I'm unsure if we are compatible. She doesn't seem to trust me by what she says, and we're really different from each other I feel. She's said things like "I see us lasting a long time" and stuff like that but yeah. We don't really fight but I feel she's just kind of all over the place as a person. We had an off and on "thing" 2 months before we got together. 

She seems pretty happy with us but I'm unsure if I am. She keeps saying things like how she really loves me, and how she think I'm "the one" and stuff like that. She's also a little clingy, texts me a little too much. Sometimes her actions and what she says are little too much,(talks too much) gives me this "woah calm down" feeling inside. We had sex. (Yes I know I'm too young don't have to tell me) But this is only because she really really wanted to. I've done it with someone else already but she was a virgin. I'm a little worried that this will complicate things, even though we talked about it and how it wouldn't stop us from breaking up if something went wrong.

Now the other part...I realized I still have feelings for another girl that I liked before I dated this girl, and she likes me as well but she's also in a relationship, her relationship is going to end soon though. I think I like her more than my girlfriend...idk how bad that is but yeah. I just really don't know what to do and would love some advice.

Aidan

TL;DR: 15M dating 14F, unsure if it's working out, she's clingy and talks too much, had sex, still have feelings for another girl who's in a relationship but it's ending soon. Need advice.

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

* "You're 15, dude. You're too young to be in a serious relationship. Take a step back and focus on yourself. You're still figuring out who you are and what you want. Don't rush into anything."
* "It sounds like you're feeling pressured and unsure about your feelings. Take some time to think about what you really want and what you're comfortable with. Have an honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and see how she reacts."
* "You're still in high school, and you're already dealing with complicated relationships and feelings. Take a deep breath and remember that it's okay to make mistakes. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you."
* "It's not uncommon for people to have feelings for multiple people at once. The important thing is to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about your feelings. If you're not sure what you want, it might be best to take a break and focus on yourself for a bit."
* "You're 15, and you're already dealing with sex and relationships. That's a lot of pressure. Take a step back and focus on your education and personal growth. You're still young, and you have your whole life ahead of you."

**CONCERNS RAISED BY REDDITORS**

* The age gap between the two individuals (15M and 14F) is a concern, as it may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
* The fact that the 15M has already had sex with someone else and is now having sex with his 14F girlfriend may be a concern, as it may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
* The fact that the 15M still has feelings for another girl who is in a relationship may be a concern, as it may be a sign of immaturity or a lack of commitment to his current relationship.
* The fact that the 14F is clingy and talks too much may be a concern, as it may be a sign of emotional instability or a lack of boundaries.
* The fact that the 15M is unsure about his feelings and is seeking advice from strangers on the internet may be a concern, as it may be a sign of immaturity or a lack of self-awareness.

TITLE: Me [29 M] with my GF [28 F] 2 years, she says I'm too paranoid, but I don't think it's totally fair.

POST: My GF flew off at me the other week.

I asked her if she was texting another guy and me asking this question almost made her breakup with me.

The reason I thought she might be is that she has suspicious phone activity. She uses it a lot when I'm not in the same room and quickly stops what she's doing when I come in, she recently started putting it on total silent when she comes home and she leaves her phone screen side down. This has only been happening past couple of months. Put this with the fact she has never acknowledged my existence in a public sense in anyway in 2 years and I felt a bit sus.

When I asked her if something fishy is going on she exploded and said I don't trust her etc etc went to stay at a friends house, and pretty much implied we were breaking up.

Now I feel if I have a problem with something or if I am a bit suspicious I cannot ask about it or she will instantly dump me.

Is it fair? I feel like I should be able to talk about what's bothering me. Am I too insecure with asking about her phone habits?

TL;DR: GF says I'm too paranoid, but I don't think it's fair. She has suspicious phone activity and I'm worried something's going on. I feel like I can't ask about it without her getting upset.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being reasonable to have concerns, but maybe you're not approaching the conversation in the best way.

TITLE: Boyfriend (M24) keeps calling me (F19) his life partner. 2 year relationship, I don't feel the same way.

POST: So basically my boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and he keeps calling me his life partner. He believes we will be married someday and would totally be okay with being engaged and living together right now. 

I, on the other hand, don't really plan on him being my "forever" due to multiple reasons (money, he's very critical, insecure) so it makes me very uncomfortable when he says this. However, it would start a huge endless argument if I ever brought this up to him so it's better to leave it alone. 

My problem though is that I don't want to waste his time when I don't plan on this lasting forever, but I also don't want to break up right now because we have a great relationship and it's a nice thing for the time being. 

Another wrench to throw in is that he has absolutely no friends besides me. This puts a lot of pressure on me to constantly be there for him and be his only source of happiness, entertainment, and companionship. This sometimes makes me feel trapped in our relationship which is a feeling I really don't like. I don't like that feeling since I'm only 19 and have been in this relationship and one before this meaning I have always been in a relationship ever since I was 16. Sometimes I get curious about being single but I feel like I can't even consider leaving him when I'm his only source of friendship. 

I'm not suggesting I want to end our relationship. But I don't like the feeling that I basically couldn't if I wanted to. Anyone else had a similar situation or general advice for how to continue in a relationship where each partner has different expectations or if it should continue at all? 
__________________________________________

TL;DR: 2-year relationship with boyfriend who calls me his life partner, but I don't feel the same way. He's critical, insecure, and has no friends besides me, making me feel trapped. I don't want to break up, but I don't want to waste his time either. Advice on how to continue or if it's worth it?

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. **Redditor1**: "Hey OP, I think you're being really honest with yourself about your feelings, which is great. It's okay to not feel the same way as your partner, and it's not fair to lead him on. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and expectations. It might be uncomfortable, but it's better to be upfront than to continue a relationship that's not fulfilling for you. Remember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."

2. **Redditor2**: "I totally get where you're coming from, OP. It's tough to navigate a relationship where you don't feel the same way as your partner. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you want from your relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. Maybe you can have a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and see if you can find a middle ground. It's also important to remember that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel good about yourself and your relationship."

3. **Redditor3**: "OP, I think you're being really smart by recognizing that you don't feel the same way as your partner. It's okay to acknowledge that and not feel guilty about it.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel good about yourself and your relationship."

TITLE: Girl [21 F] that I [23 M] have been casually seeing for a while slept with another guy, and I have no clue what my next move should be

POST: A bit of backstory: I've been with this girl for around 5 months. It started out as a purely physical thing where we'd just hook up on a regular basis then go our separate ways, but both of us wanted to keep it exclusive. Lately we've been spending more time together and it's been getting a bit more serious, but nothing drastic. I do enjoy spending time with her though if we're being totally honest.

Jump forward to last night, we're at the bar with all our friends, and this guy she used to have a bit of a fling with is there. She's drunk, giving him a little too much attention, and I can see that he's trying to get laid. So, being the aggressively jealous person that I am, I freak out & yell, we get into a big argument, I say something hateful to the guy, and I storm out in a jealous rage.

This morning, she tells me that she ended up getting blackout drunk and they hooked up. Something about how she practically had to be carried home, and she woke up naked with the guy. She seems remorseful though, and judging from the story she gave me, it sounds like he really took advantage of her drunkenness. But I don't know what actually happened, and I probably never will. Which really makes me think I should've knocked that son of a bitch out when I had a chance, but that's life I guess.

It still makes my blood boil when I think of it though, and due to the fact that our relationship isn't all that serious, I don't know if I should cut ties, or try to put it behind us, because to be honest, the sex is amazing, and I don't think this is going to happen again. But on the other hand, our one rule was that we keep it exclusive, and she broke it. I kind of have a tendency to torture myself with this type of thing as well, so my willingness to "work it out" might just be my inner masochist talking. Feedback would be great because I'm feeling pretty torn.

TL;DR: Girl I've been casually seeing slept with another guy after we got into an argument at the bar. I'm torn between cutting ties or trying to work it out because the sex is amazing, but she broke our rule of exclusivity. Help me out, Reddit! What should I do?

TITLE: My friend (20M) have a problem with a girl (20F)

POST: I'm currently trying to help him move on from her.

Long story short, my friend met a girl in uni. They talked a bit before but only on FB (talked a bit in class also but that's about it). They went on to being in different classes due to one of them failing a year. She told him on FB that she'll hang out with him. After a while she met her current BF. Now my friend says that it's not fair that she gave her BF a chance before him even though she hasn't met either one of them. They argued about it a bit. She blocked him and unblock him after a while to help him move on.

Now it has been more than a year, and he still tries to message her in whatever way possible, to the point of harassment. She would open up accounts under her name, open up other accounts, post pictures of himself and tag her in it, etc. She has contacted the police twice, and the police has talked to him twice, warning him but he doesn't care. He has specifically said he doesn't care about going to jail, as long as she will explain why she didn't give him a chance. The police also warned that he'll be kicked out of school, but he doesn't care.

I've been trying to talk to him but his mind is locked onto this, and he said it'll basically continue until she gives him a reply to why, which she has multiple times, but he thinks she's not being truthful. I'm not sure how to help him move on, as he clearly cant and I don't want him to get kicked out of school/going to jail because of a girl..

TL;DR: Friend is obsessed with a girl who blocked him after he got upset she gave her BF a chance before him. He's been harassing her for over a year, and the police have warned him multiple times. He's willing to go to jail and get kicked out of school if it means she'll explain why she didn't give him a chance. I'm trying to help him move on but he's not listening.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, your friend needs to get a grip. He's not going to get an explanation from her, and even if he did, it's not going to change the fact that she's moved on. He needs to focus on his own life and stop wasting his time on someone who doesn't want him. I'd suggest taking a break from him and letting him figure it out on his own."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "It sounds like your friend is experiencing a form of obsessive behavior. It's important to recognize that his actions are not only harming the girl, but also himself. I would recommend encouraging him to seek professional help, such as a therapist, to work through his feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Additionally, it's important to set boundaries and prioritize his own well-being."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I'm not sure if it's just me, but it seems like your friend is more interested in being right than in actually moving on. He's not going to get an explanation from her, and even if he did, it's not going to change the fact that she's moved on. I think he needs to take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities. Maybe he's using this as a way to avoid dealing with his own feelings of inadequacy or rejection."
4. **u/concerned_citizen**: "I'm not a relationship expert, but I do know that harassment is never okay. Your friend needs to stop contacting her and respect her boundaries. If he's willing to go to jail and get kicked out of school, that's not a healthy or productive way to handle his feelings. I think you should encourage him to seek help and support, and also report his behavior to the authorities if necessary."
5. **u/relationship_advice_pro**: "It sounds like your friend is experiencing a classic case of unrequited love. It's important to recognize that his feelings are not reciprocated, and that it's okay to move on. I would recommend encouraging him to focus on his own personal growth and development, and to seek out new experiences and connections. It's also important to remind him that he deserves respect and kindness, and that he should prioritize his own well-being above all else."

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my gf [17 F] of eight months broke up the other day because of her dad found out we had sex

POST: Alright, well this Sunday, the 27, I picked my girlfriend up to take to my house. Halfway there she receives and call from her mom and I have tot take her home. I didn't know what it was about, so I drop her off and take her home. I get back to my house and her father texted me that based on some information he had received, he didn't want me to see his daughter anymore. I'm here think, "Well f***." 

I call my gf later to see what happened. It turns out that her parents snooped around her room and read the messages off of her iPod (which receive her texts as well as her phone). We were talking about how we had sex and yada-yada. So her parents yelled at her and then her dad texted me that. 

Yesterday we officially broke-up because I argued with her father about the whole scenario (I know, stupid me) because I couldn't handle how he didn't see me right for his daughter just because we had sex. So she ended it because it was between me or her father. 

Since then we've still been talking and there's a lot of feelings going around - neither of us want our relationship to be over. How do I convince her parents that we should continue dating? I know I could get over her but I really don't want that to happen. A lot of stuff happens in eight months.. I honestly think I love her, but maybe I'm just young. 

Seriously though, can anyone help me with how I should handle this situation? I really want to stay with her.

TL;DR: Me and my 17-year-old girlfriend broke up because her dad found out we had sex and he doesn't want me to see his daughter anymore. We're still talking and I really don't want to lose her. How do I convince her parents that we should continue dating?

TITLE: I Want to Move Out of State?

POST: Hello everyone. So I am looking to move out of Pennsylvania. I've lived here my whole life. I'm 24 now. Have a job I don't like much. There's not many good jobs around here. I don't have many friends, and lack family (I have one best friend), so nothing is keeping me here anymore. I want to get a fresh start in a new area, where the people are friendly, plenty of job opportunities, and the weather is warm. I was going to go to school for health information management. The program is going to take probably a year to finish and I don't know if I can stay at my current job for that long. However, I don't think it's wise moving out of state with only having data entry and warehouse experience. The states that I was recommended were Texas, North Carolina, and Arizona.

Should I stick it out with my job until I finish school? Have you ever moved out of state because you were unhappy? Was the grass greener on the other side? Please share your experiences =)

TL;DR: I'm 24, want to move out of Pennsylvania for a fresh start, but have limited job experience and am worried about making the move. Should I stick it out with my job until I finish school or take the leap?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I moved from PA to AZ a few years ago for a fresh start. It was the best decision I ever made. The weather is amazing, people are friendly, and there are tons of job opportunities. I went from working a dead-end job to a career in my field. I would definitely recommend AZ. Just make sure you're prepared for the heat and dryness."
2. **u/healthcarehero**: "I'm a health information manager and I can attest that it's a great field. You'll have plenty of job opportunities after you finish your program. As for moving out of state, I did it and it was the best decision I ever made. I moved from PA to NC and it's been a game-changer for me. The people are friendly, the cost of living is lower, and the job market is thriving. Just make sure you do your research and find a place that fits your lifestyle and budget."
3. **u/JobHunter99**: "I moved from PA to TX a few years ago and it was a huge mistake. The job market is super competitive and the cost of living is high. I ended up having to take a step back and work a lower-paying job just to make ends meet. If you're considering moving to TX, make sure you have a solid plan in place and are prepared for the challenges that come with it."
4. **u/BestFriend**: "Hey, OP! I'm your best friend and I'm here to tell you that you're making a great decision. I've been with you since high school and I've seen you struggle with your job and lack of friends. You deserve a fresh start and I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes you. Just make sure you stay in touch and keep me updated on your journey!"

TITLE: I have social anxiety and am doing terribly in interviews. What can i do to improve this?

POST: This has been happening to me a lot lately. I'll get an interview, and the person who has seen my resume tells me right off it looks like my experience is a great match for the position, before we even start. 

(I'm just applying for customer service jobs for the most part, and my resume includes a lot of that, plus some lower management in a customer service job)

Anyway, I do just fine with actual customer service, for some odd reason. 

Outside of work, i don't really have a social life. I'm perfectly comfortable interacting with friends through text, but i rarely see any in person. When i do, i get a bit weird, but that's around people i'm friends with. 

Job interviews though... My mind goes blank. I try to mitigate this problem by researching what the particular company i'm working with uses for interview questions, and preparing and practicing my answers ahead of time. This doesn't work. My mind goes entirely blank, i stumble over words, it's pathetic, and every single time someone has indicated that they definitely want me to work for them based on my resume, by the end of the interview they've changed their mind. 

What can i do about this? I don't have the luxury to just keep practicing and get better, since interviews don't come around that often and i need to actually get a job fairly soon because i'm currently without an income (due to moving to a new area and taking a seasonal job which ended)

TL;DR: I have social anxiety and am doing terribly in interviews. I've tried researching and practicing, but it doesn't seem to work. What can I do to improve this?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/socialanxietywarrior**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with social anxiety in interviews. It's completely understandable, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person or a potential employee. Here are a few things that might help:

* Take a few deep breaths before the interview to calm your nerves. It might help to do some gentle stretches or yoga poses to loosen up your muscles.
* Try to focus on the conversation and the questions being asked, rather than worrying about how you're coming across. Remember that the interviewer is trying to get to know you and your qualifications, not judge you.
* Consider bringing a friend or family member with you to the interview for support. Sometimes having someone you trust nearby can help you feel more at ease.
* Don't be afraid to take a moment to collect your thoughts before answering a question. It's okay to take a pause and gather your thoughts before speaking.
* Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. It's a normal part of the interview process, and it doesn't define your worth as a candidate.

I hope these suggestions help. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to see you succeed."

2. **u/JobInterviewTips**: "I'm not a professional, but I've had my fair share of job interviews. One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on your social anxiety, try to focus on the fact that you're there to talk about your qualifications and experiences. Remember that the interviewer is trying to get to know you and your skills, not judge you.

Also, try to relax and be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not. The interviewer wants to get to know the real you, not some fake version of yourself. And don't worry if you make mistakes. It's okay to stumble over words or forget something. It's a normal part of the interview process.

Finally, try to focus on the present moment. Don't worry about the past or future. Just focus on the conversation and the questions being asked. Remember that you're there to learn more about the company and the position, and to show them why you're a good fit.

I hope these suggestions help. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to see you succeed."

3. **u/JobSearchAdvice**: "I'm not a professional, but I've been in your shoes before. One thing that might help is to try to find a job that aligns with your strengths and interests. When you're doing something you love, it's easier to be yourself and not worry so much about social anxiety.

Also, try to focus on the things you can control. Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the things you can do to prepare for the interview. Research the company, practice your answers, and make sure you have a good understanding of the position.

Finally, try to be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Just focus on learning from the experience and moving forward.

I hope these suggestions help. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to see you succeed."

TITLE: Reddit, am I being unreasonable about situation with friends staying in my house?

POST: So here's the background.  My parents moved out of the country for business (temporary) and left me to live in the house to take care of it.  It's a big house and lonely alone, so I asked if my friends could move in with me.  My parents agreed to friends A and B, but were hesitant about also allowing friends C and D because they did not want that many people living there.  All those friends lived together before, so A and B did not want to ditch C and D.  I managed to convince my parents, and they said fine, but that they would charge everyone $300/mo as rent (which basically just covers utilities).

About 2 months ago, friend A's brother comes over without A telling anyone.  I assumed it was just for a few days, but a few weeks later he was still there sleeping on the couch the whole time.  I asked A and he said he was only staying for the hockey games.  At this point my parents figured out he was here (my brother told them) and were upset that no one asked them if someone else could live there.  I told them the situation and they said fine.  

It is now 3 weeks after the Stanley Cup finals, and he is still here.  My parents are pissed that he is still here and with no definite plans on when he is moving out.  I talked to my friend about it, and he thinks my parents are being unreasonable.  Meanwhile, I'm placed in the middle of it all and am stressing out over the fact that I'm taking shit for this from both sides.  So reddit, am I being unreasonable about this?  Is there a better way I can explain this to him so he gets it?

TL;DR: Friends A and B moved in with me, and then friend A's brother came over without asking.  My parents are upset, but my friend thinks they're being unreasonable.  I'm stuck in the middle and don't know how to handle it.

---

This post is a great example of a common Reddit phenomenon: the "I'm stuck in the middle" problem. The OP is caught between their parents' expectations and their friend's behavior, and is seeking advice on how to navigate the situation.

The post is well-written and provides all the necessary context, making it easy for readers to understand the situation. The OP is also clear about their feelings and concerns, which helps to engage readers and encourage them to offer advice.

The comments on this post are also interesting, with many readers offering their opinions on who is being unreasonable and how the OP should handle the situation. Some readers suggest that the OP's parents are being too strict, while others think that the friend is being inconsiderate and should have asked permission before bringing someone else into the house.

Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be used to seek advice and gain perspective on a difficult situation. The OP's willingness to share their story and seek input from others is a great way to get help and support, and the comments on the post demonstrate the value of online communities like Reddit in providing a platform for people to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.

TITLE: Me [22M] Not feeling much for my girlfriend, but living with my her [22F] girlfriend and not sure what I can do at this point.

POST: Hello,

I'm a 22 M and have been dating my 22 F girlfriend for about 11 months now. What started off smoldering has really faded out the past few months. She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation/kisses/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation? She honestly does nothing wrong and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that she does for me. I'm just not entirely happy. Any advice?

TL;DR: Living with my girlfriend, not feeling the same way as I used to, and unsure of what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're feeling stuck because you didn't have a clear conversation about your feelings before moving in together. It's normal to feel differently after a big change like that. Have you talked to your girlfriend about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about what you're experiencing."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "OP, it sounds like you're feeling unfulfilled in your relationship. Have you considered what you want from your partner and what you're willing to work on to get there? It might be helpful to make a list of what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. This can help you communicate your needs to your girlfriend and work together to build a stronger connection."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, you're annoyed by her constant need for affection and attention? Sounds like you're just not interested in being in a relationship anymore. Maybe it's time to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what you want and what you're willing to work on to make it happen."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "OP, I think you're feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of living with someone. It's a big change, and it's normal to feel like you're losing your independence. Have you considered setting some boundaries or having a conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling? It might help to establish some alone time or personal space to recharge."
5. **ExperiencedEx**: "OP, I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon to feel this way. The key is to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about what you're feeling. It might be helpful to schedule a date night or a conversation where you can both express your feelings and work together to find a solution. Remember, relationships are about growth and compromise, so don't be afraid to have tough conversations and work through challenges together."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are a mix of advice, empathy, and tough love. Some commenters suggest having an open and honest conversation with the girlfriend about feelings, while others recommend setting boundaries or taking a step back to recharge.

TITLE: He [22] ended it before it started. I [20F] want to show him it could work.

POST: Hi guys. Need help here. I am an exchange student, and teaching my native tongue to a guy who was considering going for a year abroad in my uni. We...started dating. (This was not even two months ago.) We have wonderful chemistry, he makes me laugh and really started opening up to me. 

Two weeks ago, he started considering other options for his year abroad. Not leaving, for instance. Or another place. And he told me-a few days ago- that he doesn't want to feel pressured to go to my uni because of me. That he had a girlfriend last year who was also an exchange student and that he had made serious plans to follow her, but they ended it and he changed everything at the last minute. He told me "better now than later, trust me"; "the less I see you, the better". 

So, basically, I'm sorry he was hurt. But I really think this could work, and that we could be happy even if only for a while -and I'm trying to work up the courage to tell him, but I need advice : is this even a good idea? Any chance this could work? How can I word it?

TL;DR: Exchanged student, started dating, he ended it before it started, I want to show him it could work.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, OP, it sounds like he's already made up his mind and is just trying to let you down easy. I wouldn't bother trying to convince him to stay. You deserve better than someone who's already planning to leave you behind."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's not about you or your relationship, it's about his own uncertainty and fear of commitment. If he's already considering other options, it's likely he's not ready for a serious relationship. You deserve someone who's all in."
3. **relationship_ruth**: "OP, I think you're being too optimistic. He's already made up his mind to end things, and it's not because of you. It's because he's scared of commitment and doesn't want to be tied down. You deserve someone who's willing to work through their issues and commit to you. Don't waste your time trying to convince him to stay."
4. **cynical_cathy**: "I think you're just trying to justify your feelings and convince yourself that it's worth it. Newsflash: it's not. He's already ended things, and you're just trying to cling to something that's already gone. Let it go and move on."
5. **optimistic_oliver**: "OP, I think you're being too harsh on yourself. It's not like he's a bad person or anything. He's just scared and unsure. If you really feel like you have a connection with him, it might be worth having a conversation with him about your feelings. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way."

**Conclusion:** The majority of commenters are advising OP to move on and not waste their time trying to convince him to stay. Some commenters are more optimistic, suggesting that OP should have a conversation with him about their feelings, but also be prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way. Overall, the comments are cautioning OP against getting too attached and encouraging them to prioritize their own emotional well-being.

TITLE: Paying off $24k of debt

POST: Starting a new job on wednesday paying AUD $24.11 p/h + 9.5% super, 8 hrs a day with 30 minute lunch break 5 days a week. Its a call centre job, not cold calling.  We answer queries from customers about their utility bills etc. The contract for this job is for 6 months (probationary). I have been told that i will be offered an extension on the contract after the 6 months as long as i do my job well and not slack off. I also have family friends in company so lets just say that i will have my contract extended for the purpose of my query. Im also looking to do a networking/system administration certification in the upcoming months (which will cost around $2k, give or take). 
I have roughly $21k owing on personal loan with a 7 year repayment period and $3k owing on a credit card. I want to pay these off as quickly as i possibly can. Currently im paying rent on a place i no longer live at until August 23rd at $193 per week, roughly $85 per month for phone bill and $55 per month for something else (up until the 16th of oct). Currently only paying around $58 per month for the credit card (has been stable around this figure for quite sometime so im thinking this is just the card fee as i dont actually purchase anything with the credit card anymore) and $217 for the loan (i think this is monthly). So presuming the credit card fee stays the same, what would be better to pay off first?
Any help with this i am really grateful for.

TL;DR: New job, paying off $24k of debt, want to pay off personal loan and credit card ASAP. Currently paying $58/month for credit card and $217/month for personal loan. Should I prioritize paying off the credit card or the personal loan?

**Answer:**

Hey OP,

Congratulations on your new job! That's a great step towards paying off your debt.

Firstly, let's break down your expenses:

* Rent: $193/week until August 23rd, then you'll need to find a new place to live.
* Phone bill: $85/month
* Other expense: $55/month until October 16th
* Credit card: $58/month (assuming this is the fee, not the actual debt)
* Personal loan: $217/month

Considering your income and expenses, it's essential to prioritize your debt repayment. Since you're paying a fixed amount for the credit card, it's likely the fee, and you're not accumulating new debt on it. I'd recommend focusing on the personal loan first.

Here's a rough calculation:

* Personal loan: $21,000 @ 7-year repayment period = approximately $300/month
* Credit card: $3,000 @ unknown interest rate = approximately $150/month (assuming you're not accumulating new debt)

By paying off the personal loan first, you'll save around $83/month in interest payments compared to paying off the credit card. Additionally, you'll have a sense of accomplishment and momentum by tackling the larger debt.

Once you've paid off the personal loan, you can focus on the credit card. You can try to negotiate a lower interest rate or consider a balance transfer to a lower-interest credit card.

Remember to review your budget and adjust as needed. You may need to make some lifestyle changes to accommodate your debt repayment goals.

Good luck, and keep us updated on your progress!

**Edit:** I'd also recommend considering the networking/system administration certification. While it's an investment, it could lead to better job opportunities and a higher income in the long run. Just make sure you're not compromising your debt repayment goals in the process. **End Edit**.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to smell lube out of curiosity

POST: It began when my uncle asked me to help redecorate the house with the new furniture he got from his friend. Being the good nephew I am, I happily obliged.

Now here's where trouble begins. The furniture my uncle's friends gave to us, still had a lot of stuff in them (mostly clothes). So we had to take out the clothes and put them in garbage bags in order for us to use and carry them. Out of sheer luck, I found a bottle of lube.

The labelling on the lube said "**strawberry flavor**". I don't have much experience with sexual things and so I got really curious. I wanted to smell the lube. Yes you read that right. **I WANTED ITS FRUITY SMELL IN MY NOSTRILS**.

Little did I know that water-based lube actually has a very watery-like viscosity. Despite it clearly saying that, I still thought it had a lotion-like viscosity. So opened the cap and tried to squirt a bit into my hand.

Instead, a grand deluge of lube came down all over my body and the furniture--the fruity smell pervasive throughout the vicinity. As this was happening, my entire family stood and watched with mixed expressions of horror and confusion. I told them to relax as it was only water-based lube but my clarification only added to their horror.

They then asked, "Why did you open it?" to which I replied nonchalantly, "I just wanted to smell it."

TL;DR: I tried to smell lube out of curiosity and ended up covering myself and the furniture in a watery mess.

EDITS:

* Added more details about the situation
* Changed the title to better reflect the story
* Added a TL;DR for easier reading

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and embarrassing story about a mistake they made.

TITLE: A good friend [17 M] became very religious, I [18 M] don't know how to handle it

POST: Hello /r/relationships,
I had a few conversations over the last week with a very good friend of mine that I know for 8 years now. He's an Arab, I'm a Turk.

He always was a chill guy. We would do everything together that was funny, like literally everything. We would go out to smoke waterpipe with another friend. We would talk about anything, we would talk about girls, make fun of things that we would all find funny.

He has changed now, though. No more smoking waterpipe, no more trying to have sex before marriage, no more dating girls as it seems. He talks about why all women should wear scarfs and why they should be capped everywhere on the body. He tells me to stop consuming alcohol. He tells me to stop running after that one girl and rather go learn. He tells me to stop smoking.

He's still kind of chill and responds quiete normally when I ask him about that girl I want to date and get closer to but he also said that if he was me, he'd stop having contact.

He even sent me a video about the Islam and what you should do. I friendly said 'No' and also told him that I respect him for the way he thinks if he thinks that it's the right way but I know for a fact that I won't change and that I'll also go out to smoke with another friend later today.

It's still very strange how he has changed so quick. We would have smoked together like 1-2 months ago and now he just became like that. I don't know how to handle his behaviour. I mean, I don't really think he's going to become an extremist but he seems to be very bullheaded when it comes to religion.

Like I said, I'm a Turk but I take it all easy and also consider continuing to smoke, consume alcohol and having sex before marriage because it's and would all be just part of my life.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: A good friend of mine became very religious, changed his behavior and now tells me to stop doing things I enjoy. I don't know how to handle it.

TITLE: My [18F] girlfriend is starting college and I [19M] over think everything about her safety when I deploy at the end of the year.

POST: So I'm in the Army National Guard and was gone fall semester of my freshman year for training. 
I took classes in spring and now in the summer. I haven't really done the whole college experience and I'm not into that stuff. 
My girlfriend (of 3 years) recently started drinking and partying a lot with just her friends. 
I really despise alcohol due to a long history of alcohol abuse in my family. But If she wants to have a drink with her friends I don't really mind. 

She just had her orientation for college and is telling me know she is planning to attend a lot of frat parties and house parties.
I wouldn't be apposed to going with her to a party because she will do it regardless and I'd feel safer being able to be there. 
The catch is my unit deploys at the end of the year for 10 months. 
My greatest concern with her starting college is that she will drink and something will happen to her or she will do something she'll regret. 
Am I just extremely paranoid. Or am I alright in my concerns. Again I don't know how the college life is I just hear stories from frat guys I work with about the number of drunk girls they have slept with at these parties. 
I love this girl to death and trust her. But she is very inexperienced with alcohol and I fear the worst. Please advise.

TL;DR: Girlfriend starts college, starts partying, I'm worried about her safety and regret. I deploy at the end of the year, I'm worried about her getting hurt or doing something she'll regret. Am I just paranoid or am I right to be concerned?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not paranoid, you're a responsible partner. It's normal to worry about your girlfriend's safety, especially when you're not there to protect her. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and see how she feels about it. Maybe she'll understand where you're coming from and be willing to make some changes."
* "I'm a college student and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for freshmen to get caught up in the party scene. But it's also not uncommon for people to regret their actions the next morning. You're right to be concerned, but try not to be too controlling. Let her know your concerns and see if she's willing to compromise. Maybe she'll be more cautious or find other ways to have fun that don't involve drinking."
* "I'm a frat guy and I can tell you that it's not all fun and games. There are a lot of risks involved with partying, especially for someone who's inexperienced with alcohol. You're right to be worried, and you should definitely have a conversation with your girlfriend about it. Maybe she'll be more willing to listen to your concerns and make some changes."

TITLE: Help! I feel like that crazy girlfriend and know something needs to change.

POST: I am 21F and my boyfriend is 22M. We've been dating for about 9 months now but have been friends for 4+ years. I'm his first girlfriend. 

In my eyes, our relationship is like a wonderful dream. I've been in a long term relationship before (2 years) and it ended fairly amicable, but I know how shitty dating can be. We have so much in common, share wonderful memories and crack up together. We are in love. I'm cynical when it comes to relationships because I've experienced failure after failure, not to mention my parents are divorced. 

We argue, a lot. Over almost anything. Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day. This taints the better part of our relationship, but not enough for either of us to want to end it. Although, we did break up about 5 months ago for maybe a week. (It was a drunken break up)

If I were to describe our relationship from his point of view, you all would probably think I was a psycho. I'm clingy and have a temper. I can be too sensitive and crave attention. Honestly, I hate it, and he knows I hate it. Change isn't easy to come by, and there are some emotional/depression/self esteem issues I should work out on my own.

I guess my question is, how can I change my attitude to be a better girlfriend? Or should we break up for a while so I don't feel so attached to him? I see so much potential in our future together and love him dearly. I just want to make the right choices.

TL;DR: I'm a 21F in a 9-month relationship with my 22M boyfriend. We argue a lot, and I know I can be clingy and sensitive. I want to change for the better, but I'm not sure how. Should I take a break or work on myself before we move forward?

---

This post is a great example of someone who is self-aware and willing to acknowledge their flaws and work on themselves to improve their relationship. The OP (original poster) is honest about their clingy and sensitive nature, and is seeking advice on how to change and become a better girlfriend.

TITLE: I [30F] can't get over my ex [29M], and it's making me physically sick

POST: I feel silly even writing this - I dated my ex nearly two years ago for a while before I moved away. We kept in contact, sexted and met up again last year. It didn't turn into anything more as we were both living in different places, and I was dealing with taking care of my sick mother. He entered into a relationship with someone else following that, which ended in January. Since then, he has again has been in contact with me, texting often, asking if I had moved back in town, and wanting to meet up again when I'm coming to town in a few weeks. We've been really friendly with each other. The thing is, I know he is hooking up with other girls right now, and it makes me really sad. 

I don't want to meet up with him and get hurt, but the thought of never seeing him again is really hard. I can't seem to shake him and I don't know why. I guess we never really fell out of contact so its been hard for me to get over it. I don't why I keep hanging on. He seems able to enjoy time with other girls obviously, but I can't date - just the thought of being with someone else makes me really sad. I try to move on but my heart isn't in it. When I find out through mutual friends of him hooking up with someone, I go to a really low place. I beat myself up, I tell myself I'm not good enough/pretty enough/whatever enough to him, I really hurt myself. 

Since last year, I've lost about 10 lbs just from going through depression and anxiety. I've gotten a really great new job, and things start to look up for me, then I focus back on him and I'm really sad again. I don't want to obsess over him, but I do. I feel I've come off so pathetic still talking to him and carrying this on - I've thought of meeting up with him again but just really don't want to get hurt. Feel like I come off so foolish. Why can't I shake these feelings? How can I stop feeling so unreasonabl hurt over him?

TL;DR: I dated my ex for a while, we kept in touch, and he's now in a relationship with someone else. I still have feelings for him and it's making me physically sick. I don't want to meet up with him again and get hurt, but the thought of never seeing him again is hard. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and can't move on.

**Comments:**

1. OP, you're not pathetic for still having feelings for your ex. It's normal to still have feelings for someone you cared about deeply. The fact that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to move on is a huge step. Try to focus on yourself and your own healing instead of dwelling on what your ex is doing.
2. OP, it sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of self-blame and negative self-talk. Try to reframe your thinking and focus on what you can control - your own actions and feelings. You don't have to meet up with your ex again, but you can still choose to focus on your own healing and growth.
3. OP, have you considered talking to a therapist about your feelings? They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies to deal with the pain of your ex's new relationship.
4. OP, it's okay to take time to process your feelings and grieve the loss of the relationship. But try not to get stuck in the past. Focus on the present and future, and what you want to achieve in your life. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled.
5. OP, remember that your ex's actions are not a reflection of your worth. You are worthy of love and respect, regardless of what your ex does. Try to focus on your own strengths and accomplishments, and don't let your ex's behavior define your self-worth.

**Additional comments:**

* OP, have you considered taking a break from social media or limiting your contact with your ex? It might be helpful to distance yourself from the constant reminders of his new relationship.
* OP, it might be helpful to focus on self-care and self-love. Try doing things that make you happy and fulfilled, and surround yourself with positive people who support you.
* OP, remember that it's okay to take time to heal and process your emotions. Don't put pressure on yourself to "get over" your ex by a certain time. Focus on your own healing and growth, and don't compare yourself to others. You are unique and deserving of love and respect.

TITLE: I need some relationship advice :(

POST: i am having a confusing relationship with my ex-boyfriend. We had a neutral break-up, and agreed to stay as friends. The cause of the break-up was that, he felt that he was tied-down, and wanted more freedom as we are both just in our teens. I've tried to change his mind, but he was persistent. So right now, we are just suppose to be friends, and I'm okay with that. But now that we are not in a relationship, he treats me really well, and sometimes when we are alone, he will kiss me and hug me. He still shows that he really cares for me and likes me a lot still, but in front of his friends, he is a bit cold to me. I'm really confused, what should I do? Does he still like me more than a friend?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend and I had a neutral break-up, agreed to stay friends, but he still shows romantic interest in me, but only when we're alone. He's cold to me in front of his friends. I'm confused about his feelings.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like he's trying to have his cake and eat it too. He wants the freedom of not being in a relationship, but still wants to hold onto the romantic feelings he has for you. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you appreciate the effort he's putting in, but you need clarity on where he stands. If he's not willing to commit to being in a relationship or to being just friends, then it might be best to re-evaluate the friendship."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate the friendship. If he's only showing romantic interest in you when you're alone, and then being cold to you in front of his friends, that's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve better than someone who can't be consistent in their feelings. It's okay to take some time for yourself and focus on your own well-being."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should ask yourself what you want from this friendship. Do you want to be in a relationship with him, or do you want to be just friends? If you want to be in a relationship, then you need to have a conversation with him about your feelings and expectations. If you want to be just friends, then you need to set boundaries and be clear about what you're comfortable with. Either way, you can't keep going on like this and expect things to change on their own."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you should try to have a heart-to-heart with him and see where he's coming from. Maybe he's struggling with his own feelings and doesn't know how to express them. Maybe he's trying to prove to himself that he can be happy without you. Whatever the reason, I think it's worth exploring and having an open conversation about your feelings. Who knows, maybe he'll surprise you and realize that he still has strong feelings for you."

TITLE: Is it worth starting a relationship with a good friend [22, M] if I [22, F] know ahead of time our end goals are different?

POST: I met my friend in college a little over a year ago. The first night we hung out, we stayed up talking almost all night. We started hanging out more regularly (never anything sexual though), and then we graduated. I haven't seen him in person since then because we live far away. 

However, we text and Skype frequently. Skype conversations are never shorter than 2 hours and often last up to 4. Basically, we really understand each other and like each other's company. Seeing each other in the future is not completely out of the question... currently we live very far away but he wants to move closer to where I live for a number of reasons. And we'll be going on vacation together in a couple months. 

Both of us are recently single and craving both physical and emotional connection. But here's the thing: he is very, very opposed to having children in the future. I, on the other hand, want kids. It's completely irrelevant right now, but I'm wondering if it's even worth pursuing if I know our end goals are so different. I don't want to have to persuade him to change his mind about such a serious life decision.

TL;DR: I have a close friend who I've known for over a year, and we're both recently single. We get along great, but we have different end goals (he doesn't want kids, I do). Should I pursue a relationship with him knowing this?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's not worth it. You deserve someone who shares your values and goals. It's not fair to either of you to pretend like this isn't a huge issue."
* "I think it's worth having an open and honest conversation about your goals and expectations. If he's still not willing to compromise or consider your perspective, then maybe it's not meant to be."
* "You can't force someone to change their mind about having kids. If he's really set against it, it's not worth the potential heartache and stress of trying to convince him otherwise."
* "It's not just about having kids, it's about the kind of life you want to build together. If you're not on the same page about that, it's hard to see how the relationship would work long-term."
* "I think it's worth exploring the relationship and seeing where it goes. You never know, he might surprise you and change his mind. But if not, at least you'll have had the experience and can move on."
* "You're not going to find someone who agrees with you on everything, but you should find someone who respects your opinions and is willing to listen. If he's not willing to have that conversation, then maybe he's not the right person for you."

This post and its comments highlight the importance of considering end goals and values in a relationship. The OP is aware of the significant difference in their goals and is wondering if it's worth pursuing a relationship with someone who is unlikely to change their mind. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from advising against pursuing the relationship due to the potential for heartache and stress, to suggesting that it's worth having an open and honest conversation about goals and expectations. Ultimately, the decision depends on the individual's priorities and what they are willing to compromise on.

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 2 years. We live together and he has made a huge decision he just expects me to be OK with.

POST: SO my boyfriend and I have been living together, for 6 months now. We both work in the food industry and hes planning on going back to school in 2 weeks. 

A little background on our jobs, its important to our disagreement. I am a salary manager in a very popular corporation and he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. 

Well, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of "breaking his fucking hand" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks. 

Now I wouldnt mind so much if we were in a better economic state. I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. 

Now we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying "things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal".  
We also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. 

My question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 2 years just quit his job after being accused of stealing and is planning on going back to school. I'm worried about our financial stability and our apartment, but he's not taking my concerns seriously and thinks I'm not supporting him. Am I overreacting or is he being unreasonable?

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a platform for people to share their concerns and receive feedback from others who have experienced similar situations. The OP (original poster) is clearly upset and worried about the impact of her boyfriend's decision on their financial stability and future.

The comments on this post are varied, but many people are sympathetic to the OP's concerns and offer words of encouragement. Some people suggest that the OP should try to have a calm and rational conversation with her boyfriend about her worries, while others advise her to take a step back and focus on her own well-being.

One commenter, who has experience with a similar situation, shares a personal anecdote and offers some practical advice:

"I was in a similar situation a few years ago when my partner quit their job to pursue a new career path. It was scary and uncertain, but we worked together to create a plan and budget for the transition. I think it's great that your boyfriend is taking the leap to pursue his education, but it's also important for him to understand the impact it will have on your life and finances. Have a calm and rational conversation with him about your concerns and see if you can come up with a plan together."

Another commenter offers a more philosophical perspective:

"I think it's great that your boyfriend is taking a risk and pursuing his education. It's not always easy to make a change, but it can be incredibly rewarding in the long run. I think it's important for you to support him and be understanding, but also to communicate your concerns and needs. It's okay to be scared and uncertain, but try not to let fear hold you back from growing and changing with your partner."

Overall, the comments on this post offer a range of perspectives and advice, but many people are supportive and encouraging. The OP can use this feedback to help her navigate this challenging situation and work towards a resolution that works for both her and her boyfriend.

TITLE: How do I (f35) stay interested in my partner (m42) while he's away for extended periods of time?

POST: My partner and I have been together for over a year, living together for 2 months. He is a professor so he gets summers off to go work on his service and research. I love him dearly, and I am very much into him when we are together.

However, when he is gone longer than a week (and this summer he's been gone 3 weeks so far), I just kind of lose interest. Not in a way that I want to see other people, I just lose any kind of bond we have. This may be in part because we are terrible at keeping up with each other when we are apart.

I visited him for a few days about 1.5 weeks ago, and it was perfect. It takes a day or two to reestablish our connection, but it was wonderful. He's going to be gone a month longer with no visit. I don't know how to keep it up without being totally estranged when he returns. 

I'm not angry with him, I don't want to break up. I just feel... apathetic? Like he's just a distant person who resides in my home. I don't know how to explain it other than apathy. I don't want to feel this way about him.

TL;DR: My partner is away for extended periods, and when he's gone, I lose interest in him. How do I stay connected and interested when he's away for a month at a time?

COMMENTS:

* "Have you guys talked about this? Maybe he's feeling the same way and doesn't know how to express it. It's possible that you both need to work on communication and intimacy when you're apart."
* "Have you tried scheduling regular video calls or texting each other regularly? It can help keep the connection alive even when you're physically apart."
* "It might be helpful to have a routine or ritual that you both do when you're apart, like sending each other a daily photo or writing a letter. It can help create a sense of closeness even when you're not together."
* "I think it's normal to feel apathetic when your partner is away for a long time. It's not that you don't love them, it's just that you're not used to being apart for that long. Maybe try to focus on the things you love about your partner and the things you're looking forward to when he gets back."
* "Have you considered planning a fun activity or trip for when he gets back? It can give you something to look forward to and help you feel more connected when he returns."
* "It might be helpful to have a'stay connected' plan in place, like a shared calendar or a list of things you want to talk about when you're apart. It can help you feel more connected and prevent feelings of apathy."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work on them. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling disconnected from our partner. Maybe try to focus on the things you love about your partner and the things you're looking forward to when he gets back."

TITLE: What's the most badass thing your mother or father has ever done?

POST: My father used to live in Chicago. He owned a furniture store. There was a large business across the street, and the business didn't have very good parking. So, this one employee would always park in my father's parking lot.

My father asked him everyday for a week to please stop parking there, because it took parking spots away from his customers.

On the first 4 days the guy says "yah, sure. I won't park here."

On the 5th day, the guy says, "Fuck off! This is a free country!"

So, my dad waits for the guy to park in his lot again the following Monday.

The guy parks in my father's parking lot, flips him off, and then storms to the business across the street.

So, my father being the natural badass he was, sprays water all over the car. Keep in mind this is in CHICAGO. In the FUCKING WINTER.

When the guy comes out from work a few hours later, he finds my dad standing there with a hose, smoking a cigarette, with the douchebag's car almost completely frozen.

The guy flips his shit and tells my dad he's calling the cops, and my father just says nonchalantly "It's a free country, isn't it?".

The douchebag's car was frozen in my father's parking lot for the rest of the winter. It was actually in the news, but I can't seem to find it on the internet, considering it happened in like the 60's.

Needless to say, the following spring, the guy didn't park his car in my father's parking lot.

TL;DR: My dad used to own a furniture store in Chicago. A guy would park in his lot every day, despite being asked not to. One day, my dad sprayed water all over the car, freezing it in the winter. The guy flipped out, but my dad just shrugged and said "it's a free country". The car was stuck in the lot for the rest of the winter.

---

This post has received over 2,000 comments, with many users praising the father's bold and humorous response to the situation. The post has also been shared and upvoted numerous times, making it one of the most popular posts on the subreddit.

The post's popularity can be attributed to the relatable and entertaining nature of the story, as well as the impressive display of sass and confidence shown by the father. The fact that the story is set in the 1960s adds to its charm, making it a nostalgic and amusing tale that many users can appreciate.

The post has also sparked a lot of discussion and debate, with some users defending the father's actions and others criticizing him for being too aggressive. However, overall, the post has been well-received and has become a beloved and iconic story on the subreddit.

TITLE: I [M 21] dont know how to convey to a girl that I like her and want more than a friendship.

POST: Basically my issue is that I'm terrible at telling someone I'm interested in them in ways more than a friend. I'm not sure what it is or why it happens per say, but I just cannot break that barrier. I'm great at forming long lasting friendships but they form due to my interest in the girl as more than friends. 

As stupid as it sounds, I quite literally get "stuck" in the "friendzone" as a result of my own inability to act on my feelings and tell the other party I am interested in more ways than just friendship. 

Lately I've been wondering if this is just something I personally deal with or if its common. Any help/advice/tips/changes I can make to myself/my perception would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm 21 and I'm terrible at telling someone I'm interested in them more than a friend. I get stuck in the "friendzone" and I don't know how to get out of it.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I used to struggle with this too. For me, it was about being honest with myself and acknowledging that I was scared of rejection. Once I accepted that it was okay to be rejected, I started to open up more and take risks. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. Try to focus on building a connection with the girl and see where it takes you. And remember, it's okay to be vulnerable and take risks. It's a part of life."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You don't have to be perfect or have a grand romantic gesture to show your interest. Sometimes it's as simple as having a conversation and being genuine. Try to have a heart-to-heart with the girl and see where it takes you. And if it doesn't work out, that's okay too. You can always maintain a friendship and move on. Remember, it's not about the outcome, it's about being true to yourself and taking a chance."
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "OP, I'm 23 and I still struggle with this too. For me, it's about finding ways to show my interest in a more subtle way. Like, instead of directly telling her I like her, I try to find ways to show my interest through actions. Like, if we're hanging out and I notice she likes a certain type of music, I'll make an effort to play that music around her. It's not always easy, but it's a start. And remember, it's okay to take your time and not rush into anything. Good luck, OP!"
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "OP, I think you're putting too much emphasis on the 'friendzone'. The truth is, most people are not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with someone they don't feel a strong connection with. Instead of focusing on getting out of the 'friendzone', try to focus on building a connection with the girl and seeing where it takes you. And remember, it's okay to be rejected. It's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Good luck, OP!"

**Key takeaways:**

* It's okay to be vulnerable and take risks in relationships
* Focus on building a connection with the girl and see where it takes you
* It's not about the outcome, it's about being true to yourself and taking a chance
* Try to find ways to show your interest in a more subtle way
* It's okay to take your time and not rush into anything
* Focus on building a connection with the girl and seeing where it takes you, rather than trying to get out of the 'friendzone'

TITLE: I don't feel like my wife [32/f] can be emotionally intimate with me [32/m]. Can we get there? If so, how?

POST: I'm [32/m] a pretty intimate person with my friends, strangers, and family. I tend to overshare easily, introspect often, and have no problem connecting with other people who are like me very quickly and on a deep level. 

Unfortunately, that doesn't include my wife [32/f]. She comes from a closed family and doesn't easily open up. This manifests itself in all aspects of her life. She's wary of sharing details with strangers, tends to talk about basic things with me, and is quite bored/ uninterested in sex. But most of all, I have been nagged for years by the feeling that we don't have a "spark" - an emotional connection that makes me want to do everything for her. 

I have got to the point where what we have feels increasingly like a friendship rather than a deep emotional relationship. I have suggested that I'm not willing to be in a relationship that's not fulfilling emotionally and have told her that I have considered a separation. 

Our therapist thinks that my wife needs to get better in touch with her sexuality in order to open up more, but I'm not sure. That feels like treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. I think the problem is deeper than just sex. I think she's not able to be intimate emotionally with me. 

I know that stereotypically, it's the guy who can't be emotionally intimate and the girl who seeks it. But I just wonder, is emotional intimacy something that one can "learn to do"? Or is she just likely to always have a hard time opening up? And finally, is lack of emotional intimacy grounds to divorce someone?

TL;DR: I feel like my wife and I don't have an emotional connection and I'm not sure if it's something she can learn to do or if it's just her nature. I've suggested a separation and our therapist thinks she needs to work on her sexuality. I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **Emotional intimacy is not something you can "learn"**: "I think it's important to understand that emotional intimacy is not something that can be taught or learned. It's a natural part of human connection and can't be forced. If your wife is not naturally inclined to be emotionally intimate, it may be a fundamental aspect of her personality that can't be changed."

2. **Focus on building trust and vulnerability**: "Instead of focusing on 'fixing' your wife, try building trust and vulnerability with her. Share your feelings and thoughts with her, and create a safe space for her to do the same. This can help create a deeper emotional connection, but it's not a guarantee."

3. **It's not just about sex**: "I think it's great that you're recognizing that emotional intimacy is important, but it's not just about sex. It's about feeling seen, heard, and understood by your partner. If your wife is not naturally inclined to be emotionally intimate, it may be a challenge to overcome, but it's not impossible."

4. **Consider couples therapy**: "I think couples therapy could be really helpful in this situation. A therapist can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your issues. It's not a magic solution, but it can be a powerful tool for building a stronger connection."

5. **It's not always about the other person**: "I think it's important to recognize that sometimes, emotional intimacy is not just about the other person. It's about your own emotional availability and willingness to be vulnerable. Are you willing to take the risk and be emotionally intimate with your wife, even if she's not naturally inclined to do the same?"

---

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit community is generally supportive and empathetic, with many users sharing their own experiences and offering advice. The top comments highlight the importance of building trust, vulnerability, and emotional availability, and suggest that couples therapy could be a helpful tool. However, some users also caution that emotional intimacy is not something that can be forced or learned, and that it may be a fundamental aspect of a person's personality that cannot be changed. Overall, the community encourages the OP to focus on building a deeper connection with his wife, but also acknowledges that it may be a challenging and complex issue to overcome.

TITLE: The new guy I'm seeing [24/m] likes to sit on the same side of the table as me [20/f]. Weird or cute?

POST: I've been seeing this guy now for about a month or so (note: we're both in our 20s), and when we go out to eat he likes to sit on the same side of the table. Personally, I think it's cute; most of the other guys that I've dated have never done this. When I asked him why he likes to sit on the same side of the table he said he feels its more romantic. However, my friends think it's weird. They say it's normal for being out in a group to sit next to your SO, but not while out to eat alone together. I don't want to be judged at restaurants, but at the same time I don't see what the big deal is. Since this has become somewhat of a debate, I thought I'd ask Reddit! What do you all think? And if you all think it is  weird, how should I explain this to my new man?

TL;DR: New guy likes to sit on the same side of the table as me when we're out to eat, thinks it's more romantic. Friends think it's weird. What do you think?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's cute! It's a small gesture that shows he's paying attention to you and wants to be close. Don't worry about what your friends think, it's not about them, it's about you two."
* "I'm with the OP, I think it's weird. It's not like you're in a group, you're just the two of you. It's a bit awkward and makes me think he's trying too hard."
* "I don't think it's a big deal either way. If you're comfortable with it, then that's all that matters. But if you're worried about what others think, maybe have a conversation with him about it and see what he says."
* "I think it's a bit of both. It's cute that he's trying to be romantic, but it's also a bit awkward. Maybe you can compromise and sit on opposite sides of the table sometimes?"
* "I'm a guy and I think it's weird. I mean, I get it, he wants to be close, but it's just a table. There are more important things to focus on in a relationship than where you sit at a restaurant."
* "I think it's a sign of insecurity. If he's trying too hard to be close, it might be because he's not feeling secure in the relationship. Just something to consider."
* "I'm a woman and I think it's cute! It's a small thing, but it shows he's thinking about you and wants to be close. Don't worry about what others think, focus on what makes you happy."
* "I think it's a bit of a power play. He's trying to assert dominance by sitting next to you. Just something to consider."
* "I think it's just a quirk. If it's not bothering you, then it's not a big deal. But if you're worried about what others think, maybe have a conversation with him about it and see what he says."

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: people seeking advice on whether a particular behavior or trait in their partner is normal, cute, or weird. In this case, the OP is seeking feedback on whether her new boyfriend's habit of sitting on the same side of the table as her is normal or unusual. The comments range from "cute" to "weird" and offer various perspectives on the behavior, including suggestions for compromise and consideration of potential underlying motivations. The post highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships, as well as the subjective nature of what is considered "normal" or "cute."

TITLE: Don't try to tell me what I can't do.

POST: Earlier this year, I applied for a summer job at my university. It paid decently but allowed me to take classes offline, which I preferred to do, so I went for it. At the same time, a friend of mine (we'll call him Jack) was applying for the job.

Jack became a dick about the job really quickly. Told me I wasn't really qualified (even though I'd been working for the department this job came through for a year) and that my customer service skills were lacking (even though he's seen my boss praise them). Needless to say, I was unhappy and pride mode went into overdrive.

Originally, my plan was to go in and just talk about what I knew and how I could be of service. But his lack of faith made me step it up a notch. I talked to people who had the job in the past. I did research on the people hiring me. I even went to one of the old hirers to get some tips. I was running at 110%.

Interviews end and we find out the results. I got the job. Jack didn't. I went to go talk to him about it but was pulled aside by my friend first, who showed me tweets Jack made saying I was cocky and didn't deserve the job. His reasoning was that I said I wish I knew if I got the job sooner than the date we were expected to, because I just wanted to know so I could get on with my life and stop stressing. He took it as me thinking I got the job.

Knowing about the tweets (I don't use Twitter), I decided to be the lesser man in the situation. At this time, Jack and I were roommates. I walked it and he was quiet. Obviously pissed at me. So I go next door to our friend's room and just shouted "[FRIEND] I GOT THE JOB! I'M SO EXCITED!" The walls of our dorm were small. I know he heard me. Walked back in and he just glared at me, but I didn't care. He was a dick.

TL;DR: Roommate Jack was a huge jerk about a job I applied for. I got the job and he didn't. He made tweets saying I was cocky and didn't deserve it. I decided to have a little fun and shout the news to our friend's room, knowing he'd hear it. Petty revenge, but it felt good.

---

**Comments:**

* "Lol, I love how you didn't let him get to you and just went for it. You got the job and he's still salty"
* "I'm dying over here, 'I'M SO EXCITED!'"
* "You're a boss for not letting him get to you. I would've done the same thing"
* "I love how you didn't even bother to confront him about the tweets. You just let him stew in his own juices"
* "This is the kind of petty revenge I can get behind. Well played, OP"
* "I'm surprised he didn't try to get in a fight with you over it. You must have really gotten under his skin"
* "I hope you're enjoying your new job and that Jack is still seething with jealousy"
* "I love how you turned a negative situation into a positive one. You got the job and you got to have a little fun at his expense. Win-win"

TITLE: Broke up over a month ago. Still bummed out sometimes. Advice?

POST: Hey guys,
 My SO broke up with me over a month ago. The first week has been hard but I got over it. Problem is that from time to time I still think about it and it really bums me out.

Tonight, I randomly started thinking about the offer of having sex that she gave me 5 days ago to which I declined. I think it was a good decision for the both of us but I might have been a little harsh by saying "it would be weird to hook up again". In some twisted way, I might have said that to convince myself I'm over her.

I don't want to get back together because of the long distance, her inability to express emotions, her controlling and her manipulation of the insatisfaction of her own truth but I still have the remainder of some feelings.

TL;DR: Broke up over a month ago, still have feelings, sometimes bummed out. Advice?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, it's normal to still have feelings after a breakup. It's like your brain is trying to process everything that happened. Don't beat yourself up over it. Just acknowledge the feelings and move forward. You're doing better than you think.
2. **SarcasticSally**: Girl, you're still thinking about the offer? Girl, bye. You made the right decision by declining. You're better off without her. Don't go back to that toxic relationship.
3. **ExperiencedEx**: I went through a similar situation. It took me a while to realize that I was still holding onto the relationship because of the good times, not because I was truly happy. You need to focus on yourself and what makes you happy. You deserve better than someone who doesn't appreciate you.
4. **CynicalChris**: Honestly, it sounds like you're still in love with her. You need to accept that and move on. You can't keep holding onto the hope that things will go back to the way they were. It's time to let go and find someone who truly loves and appreciates you.
5. **SupportiveSarah**: Hey, I'm so sorry to hear that you're still going through this. It's tough to move on, especially when there are still feelings involved. But you're doing better than you think. You're acknowledging your feelings and that's the first step to healing. Keep being kind to yourself and remember that you're strong enough to get through this.

**What do you think? Do you agree with the comments? Do you have any advice for the OP?**

TITLE: My [24f] BF [28M] of three months only wants to hang out 1-2x a week, which means we only have sex once a week. I need more. What do I do?

POST: BF and I have been dating for a few months. at first we hung out all the time and had sex every day, sometimes twice a day.
For the past two months we've been hanging Out less and less. Probably 1-2x a week max now. Usually if we hang out a second time it's with other people so we don't have sex, meaning that we've been having sex literally once a week.

I can't really handle it. I need it 3-4 days a week ideally. I've told him before that he can hit me up for sex whenever but he has never done that. We also used to have sexy convos by text all the time but now we basically never do. I finally told him some time back that I want to start doing that again and he agreed but we haven't. A few times I've tried to start something naughty over text and he didn't really go for it.

I think the big problem is just not hanging out enough, but I don't think he wants a relationship where we're seeing each other every other day.

TL;DR: BF only wants to hang out 1-2x a week, which means we only have sex once a week. I need more. What do I do?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like your BF is not interested in a serious relationship with you. If he's not willing to put in the effort to hang out and have sex regularly, then he's not the right guy for you. You deserve better."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. One or two hangouts a week is not that bad. Maybe you're just used to having a lot of attention from him and now you're feeling neglected. Try to communicate with him and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm a guy and I can tell you that guys can get busy and stressed out. Maybe he's going through a tough time and doesn't have the energy for sex and hangouts as often. Try to be understanding and see if things improve over time."
* "If you're not getting what you need from the relationship, then it's time to reevaluate. You can't keep waiting for him to change or magically start wanting to hang out more. You need to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs."
* "Have you tried talking to him about how you're feeling? Sometimes guys just need a little nudge to realize what they're missing. Maybe he's not even aware that you're feeling this way. Try to have an open and honest conversation with him and see if you can find a solution that works for both of you." SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TL;DR: BF only wants to hang out 1-2x a week, which means we only have sex once a week. I need more. What do I do?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like your BF is not interested in a serious relationship with you. If he's not willing to put in the effort to hang out and have sex regularly, then he's not the right guy for you. You deserve better."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. One or two hangouts a week is not that bad. Maybe you're just used to having a lot of attention from him and now you're feeling neglected. Try to communicate with him and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm a guy and I can tell you that guys can get busy and stressed out. Maybe he's going through a tough time and doesn't have the energy for sex and hangouts as often. Try to be understanding and see if things improve over time."
* "If you're not getting what you need from the relationship, then it's time to reevaluate. You can't keep waiting for him to change or magically start wanting to hang out more. You need to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs."
* "Have you tried talking to him about how you're feeling? Sometimes guys just need a little nudge to realize what they're missing. Maybe he's not even aware that you're feeling this way. Try to have an open and honest conversation with him and see if you can find a solution that works for both of you." SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TITLE: TIFU by peeing

POST: Happened just now. I happily skip up the stairs, getting ready to head to bed. I brush my teeth and then feel the sudden urge to pee. I drop trou and let it go, spraying my urine all in the toilet.

Midway through, as I was about to go no hands, I see a spider crawling up the toilet roll. I panic, and jolt backwards, making my urine go all over the place. Then, with my baby maker out, stir dripping my urine, I grab the nearest deadly thing to banish this monstrosity. Air freshner. 

I spray it as it crawls away. Then I lost it. So I pulled my trousers back up and ran. I'll clean the floor when that bastard is dead.

TL;DR: Peeing, saw spider, panicked, sprayed air freshner, ran away.

EDIT: I just went back to check on the spider and it's still alive. I'm going to bed, I'm done with this day.

TITLE: First relationship [19M] with my GF [19F], been going out for 3 months - what do we do now?

POST: Ok, so first off let me just say that things are going great. We've been on dates, we hang out loads and we genuinely really really like each other (maybe even love?).

Up till now, everything sorta felt like we've been climbing up this relationship ladder, but right now it seems like, short of marriage and children, we're as high up as we can be. I guess what I'm trying to ask is - what do we do now?

Do we just keep on going as things are (it's definitely not stale yet btw) or what? I guess maybe I also don't know how much time I should try to spend with her coz I don't wanna come across as too needy (sounds stupid I know). Basically I'm just a bit confused about what to do with our relationship at this point. Any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)

TL;DR: Been dating my GF for 3 months, things are great, but now I'm unsure what to do next. Should we just keep going as is or try something new? How much time should I spend with her without being too needy?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 19, relax! You're not gonna figure it out overnight. Just keep doing what you're doing and see where it takes you. If you're feeling unsure, talk to your GF about it. Communication is key in any relationship."
* "I think you're overthinking this. You're 19, you're in a relationship, and you're wondering what to do next? Just enjoy the ride, man. You're young, you're in love, and you're figuring things out together. Don't put too much pressure on it."
* "I think you should try to plan some bigger trips or activities together. You've been dating for 3 months, it's time to mix things up a bit. And don't worry about being too needy, if your GF is the right person for you, she'll appreciate the effort you put in."
* "I'm a bit older than you, and I can tell you that relationships take work. You can't just coast on the initial excitement and romance. You need to put in the effort to keep the spark alive. So, yeah, plan some trips, have some deep conversations, and show your GF that you're committed to making this work."
* "Honestly, I think you're just feeling a bit bored because you're not used to being in a relationship. It's normal to feel that way. Just shake things up a bit, try some new things, and see where it takes you. And don't worry about being too needy, your GF will appreciate the effort you put in."

This post and its comments demonstrate a common theme in relationships: the uncertainty and anxiety that comes with navigating the next steps in a relationship. The OP is unsure what to do next and is seeking advice from others. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from "relax and enjoy the ride" to "put in the effort to keep the spark alive." The post and comments also highlight the importance of communication in relationships, with many commenters suggesting that the OP talk to his GF about his feelings and concerns. Overall, this post and its comments provide a relatable and realistic portrayal of the challenges and uncertainties of being in a relationship.

TITLE: My [18 M] girlfriend [18 F] of a year and I decided to break up for college about 5 days ago. I think I want to try long distance.

POST: We had been dating for a year, things we're going well but she was always a very flirty person. I developed trust issues because of her being so flirty so when we went to different colleges I pushed for a breakup.

She had been 100% willing to try and make long distance work, but I just couldn't get over my doubts. After a week apart, I realized I would always regret not at least trying to make things work, so I decided I'd try to get her back. I looked up a train route to her university, found a fancy pizza place(it's her favorite), and an ice skating rink in her area.

I called her up that night, spilled my heart out and asked if she'd take me back. I explained that if she said yes, I'd take her on the best date of her life, and if she said no that she should know I'd still feel way better than I had been.

She told me that first I needed to know that the previous Friday she had a drunken one night stand attempting to get over me. She said she regretted it and that it meant nothing, but it crushed me. I thought the worst she could say was no, but this was far worse.

It had literally been days after our breakup, we had been talking the entire time, we had even said that we loved each other the night before. I still love her, but I don't know if I could ever forgive her. I know it wasn't really cheating because we didn't have a title, but it was like the first opportunity she had, she left me behind.

I'm extremely emotional and distraught right now and I don't know what to tell her. Any advice/comments would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I broke up 5 days ago due to college, but I think I want to try long distance. I tried to get her back, but she told me she had a drunken one night stand with someone else. I'm torn between forgiveness and anger.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot. I think you need to take some time to process your emotions and figure out what you really want. Forgiveness is a process, and it's not something you can rush. You need to think about whether you can truly get past this and if it's worth it for you. Have an honest conversation with yourself and your girlfriend about what you're both willing to work through."
* "I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. You said she was always flirty, and now she's had a one night stand. It sounds like she's not committed to you or your relationship. You deserve better than someone who's willing to cheat on you, even if it's just a drunken mistake. You need to think about what you want and what you're willing to accept in a relationship."
* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time. I think you need to have a honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. You need to tell her that you're hurt and that you're struggling to forgive her. You need to be honest about your feelings and what you're willing to work through. Remember that forgiveness is a process, and it's not something you can rush. You need to take your time and figure out what's best for you."
* "I think you need to take a break from the relationship and focus on yourself. You're clearly still in love with her, but you need to think about what you want and what you're willing to accept in a relationship. You deserve someone who's committed to you and your relationship. You need to take some time to figure out what you want and what you're willing to work through. Remember that you're worth it, and you deserve someone who loves and respects you for who you are."

TITLE: A serious communication problem between me[M21] and my girlfriend[F19]. Am I being an asshole to her?Or something else?

POST: My gf and I have been dating for more than 1.5 year and were friends for more than 3 years. I know a lot about her and she does the same about me. She's a really great person. I could spend the whole day describing how much I like her and how much I am lucky to be with her. But there's an issue in our relationship that I can't get over or keep up with. The issue is her crying during the majority of serious/heated conversations. When we strongly disagree on something and struggle to reach an agreement, I try to calm down, explain my opinion more precisely and ask more questions about the parts that I don't understand about her opinion, but instead of doing the same as I do, she starts getting frustrated, and cries. Reasonably it's the end of the talking, but for her it's not. She asks me to stay and listen to her expressing her frustration about the situation and me not agreeing with her (while she continues crying) instead of calmly discussing the actual problem.  

Yesterday I tried to talk her about her crying problem and how her actions are unproductive in solving anything without hurting her feelings, but I apparently couldn't. She shifted the blame on me and accused me of not caring about her and not want to spend time with her. She stormed out of the house. Now it has been 24 hours since our fight. I called her at least three times but she didn't answer my calls. She probably staying at her parents' house.

TL;DR: My girlfriend cries during serious conversations and I'm trying to address the issue, but she shifts the blame on me and accuses me of not caring about her.

TITLE: My [21/F] husband [23/M] is always on his phone, getting me super irritated. Advice?

POST: (Sorry if this is rambly, I'm just super annoyed!)!My husband (24) and I [21/F] have been together 5 years. Lately, he has been really irritating me lately with his excessive phone use, and it's starting to get under my skin! He is constantly on his phone, either playing his stupid game or on Facebook or God knows what else. 

We have a 1 year old son, and it's gotten to the point where he'll sit on the couch and play on his goddamn phone while my son tries to play with him. And it's ALL night. I am mainly the one playing and taking care of our son. He wasn't this bad before, he would put his phone down while our son was awake, but lately it doesn't matter.. I rarely have my phone. My son is usually throwing it around or it's on the floor. I only really use it when my son is napping or at night when my son is in bed. I DONT want to be one of those parents who's always on their phone, that's why I rarely have it on me when my son is awake. Plus, he's a handful enough already lol. Anyway, my husband is really irritating me with his phone use. And sometimes he can get a little weird with me touching it too. it always has to be in his reach. It's starting to make me wonder if maybe he's doing more than being on FB :-/ 

Ive tried talking to him so many times about it. I've tried to talk to him about it nicely, and not so nicely. I bring up my concerns, but he usually stops for a couple hours or maybe one day, than goes right back. Tonight, I told him to please get off his phone and help with J (our son, he has a really bad cold) and he got mad, tossed his phone and just sat there and was all mad. It's getting ridiculous and I don't know what else to do.

TL;DR: Husband is always on his phone, gets me super irritated, and I don't know what else to do.

---

**Annotated Post**

* The OP (original poster) is a 21-year-old female who has been married to her husband for 5 years.
* She is frustrated with her husband's excessive phone use, which has become a source of tension in their relationship.
* The OP feels that her husband is neglecting their 1-year-old son and not spending quality time with him, as he is always on his phone.
* She has tried talking to her husband about the issue multiple times, but he has not made any significant changes.
* The OP is worried that her husband may be doing something inappropriate on his phone, which is why she is concerned about his behavior.
* She feels that her husband is not taking her concerns seriously and is becoming defensive when she brings up the issue.

**Possible Solutions**

1. **Open and honest communication**: The OP should continue to communicate her concerns to her husband in a non-accusatory and non-judgmental way. She should express how his phone use is affecting her and their relationship, and ask him to find ways to balance his phone use with spending time with their son.
2. **Set boundaries**: The OP should set clear boundaries around phone use in their home, such as designating phone-free zones or times. She should also encourage her husband to put his phone away during family activities and when their son is awake.
3. **Encourage alternative activities**: The OP should encourage her husband to find alternative activities to do with their son, such as playing games, reading, or going for walks. This can help him bond with their son and reduce his reliance on his phone.
4. **Seek professional help**: If the OP's concerns are not being addressed and are causing significant stress in their relationship, she may want to consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A therapist can help them communicate more effectively and work through their issues.

**Red Flags**

1. **Defensiveness**: The OP's husband becomes defensive when she brings up the issue, which may indicate that he is not taking her concerns seriously or is not willing to work on the problem.
2. **Lack of accountability**: The OP's husband does not seem to be taking responsibility for his phone use and its impact on their relationship and son.
3. **Potential infidelity**: The OP's concerns about her husband's phone use may be related to potential infidelity, which is a serious issue that requires attention and addressing. The OP should consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to work through these concerns.

TITLE: TIFU by telling a tinder girl she didn't have to shave

POST: Been on tinder lately. Well i matched with a girl that looked decent and had potential. We talked for awhile over the app and then she decided to come over. She had asked me if it was ok that she hadnt shaved, now i am a mature adult so a little bit of hair is no big deal. She shows up, not quite as good as her pictures which is typical, and sounds pretty manly. We hang for a bit and then start getting into it. I reached in and felt bush but that doesnt bother me anyway so everything is good. Eventually her pants come off and now i see why she said she didnt shave. Her pubes ended around her knees and i could smell her. I tried to muster through, trying to avoid hurting her self-esteem by asking her to leave or stopping. I eventually got it up by thinking happy thoughts and covered my jimmie, went for a few minutes and then she wanted to get on top. When she did so i was forced to view the garden and went limp. I said that i had to pee before and thats maybe my problem, it wasn't, so i went into the bathroom and started getting myself hard again, fake flushed the toilet and rushed out to get back in there. Again within a few minutes i was soft again. At this point i decided to tell her that i have this problem if i have jacked off recently and told her i did an hour before to last longer, not an actual problem for me i promise, and told her that i probably wont be able to finish and eventually sent her on her way. Hopped in the shower and cleaned the smell off of me.

TL;DR: TIFU by telling a tinder girl she didn't have to shave and then had to fake a bathroom break to avoid having to finish because of her pubic hair.

TITLE: 18 month old daughter consistently screams for 1-4 hours every night at bedtime. HELP!

POST: My daughter has been screaming for 2 hours so please bare with me as I try to articulate how I feel and what is going on. 

I am 30 weeks pregnant and essentially a single mom ( husband is in the oil field). I really need to be able to sleep!

My daughter has always been a handful at bedtime to say the least. I have tried later bedtimes, comforting every 15, 20,  45, 60 minutes and it only fuels her tantrums more. I  currently doing the 'cry it out' method but haven't been able to stick with it for more than a few days on the past. 

I feel awful just leaving her cry herself to sleep ( when it works). I don't want her to have lasting issues because she thinks no one loves her. 

She has always had a very consistent bedtime routine. I have always prided myself on that. Her actual sleeping habits are straight from hell, since the day she was born. 

Her routine:
Supper: 530-6
Bath: 630-7
Quiet time: books, a tv show 
Teeth, new diaper
Bed: 8-830
Scream: 8-12

The only part in her routine that has ever changed is the hour we put her to bed and it has only changed once from 730, that was 8 months ago. 

She has never consistently slept through the night, she doesn't sleep past 6 ever...even if she doesn't fall asleep until midnight.

TL;DR: 18 month old daughter screams for 1-4 hours every night at bedtime. I've tried various methods, but nothing seems to work. I'm feeling exhausted and desperate for help.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you've tried a lot of different approaches, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and exhausted.

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "comforting every 15, 20, 45, 60 minutes"? Are you going in to check on her, or are you actually picking her up and holding her?

Also, have you considered talking to your pediatrician about this? They may be able to offer some additional guidance or support.

Lastly, have you tried any white noise or other environmental changes to help her sleep better? Sometimes, small changes to the environment can make a big difference.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're doing everything you can to help your daughter sleep, but it's just not working.

I want to suggest that you try to focus on what you can control, which is your own reaction to the situation. It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and exhausted, and that's understandable. But instead of beating yourself up over not being able to get her to sleep, try to focus on taking care of yourself.

Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and taking breaks when you need them. It's okay to ask for help, whether it's from your husband, family, or friends. And don't be afraid to reach out to your pediatrician for additional guidance and support.

Remember, you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship with your daughter, and don't be too hard on yourself.

TITLE: TIFU by not wanting to be late for work.

POST: I work midnights at a gas station so I'm the only one there on most nights. Meaning I cannot afford to be late or the person I'm replacing not only gets pissed off but can risk going over on hours (god forbidden the damn place pays them an extra dollar for not clocking out on time). While getting ready with about 10mins until I had to leave I had the need to shit. And I of course made the mistake of deciding to hold it until after work (hence why I'm posting here). 
Luckily this is not a "I shit my pants" story, I was able to make it to work and a few hours in my shift with mild discomfort but no huge problems. It was around 3am and very slow (we stop selling beer at 1am so after that its dead). I decided now was the prefect time to take my shit. About 5mins into it I heard the door ring... FUCK...
It was the point of no return though, they could wait a few minutes. Then I heard the dreaded "HELLO IS ANYONE HERE?!" I quickly finished up and came out. It was my bosses 20yr old spoiled bitchy brat. Fuck everything. She makes a hugeass deal out of it saying she was waiting for 10 minutes (which is bullshit) and that "My mother will hear about this". She's the kind of person that overreacts to everything and hopefully my manager will understand that... Hopefully

TL;DR: I held in a bowel movement until I got to work, then had to take it during a slow period. My boss's 20yr old brat daughter showed up and overreacted, saying she was waiting for 10 minutes and that her mom will hear about it.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to be a good Samaritan.

POST: So I was driving home from work yesterday and I saw a guy on the side of the road with a flat tire. I'm a pretty decent mechanic, so I figured I'd stop and help him out. I pull over and get out of my car, and the guy is super grateful and thanks me profusely. I'm happy to help, so I get to work changing the tire. It takes me about 20 minutes, and the guy is still thanking me and offering me money, but I just tell him to keep it, I'm happy to help.

Fast forward to about an hour later, and I'm still driving home. I'm stopped at a red light, and I see the same guy from earlier, but this time he's driving a brand new, expensive-looking car. I'm thinking to myself, "Wow, that guy must have been really grateful to have gotten a new car out of this deal." But then I start to feel a little uneasy, because I realize that I never actually got his permission to take his car and drive it away. I mean, I thought he was just borrowing it from a friend or something, but now I'm starting to wonder if maybe I just stole his car.

I'm freaking out, and I don't know what to do. I'm thinking about calling the cops, but then I'm worried that they'll think I'm some kind of crazy person for stealing a car. I'm just sitting there at the red light, trying to figure out what to do, when I see the guy from earlier pull up next to me in his old car, with a flat tire. I'm like, "Oh no, this is it. I'm going to get caught."

But then he rolls down his window and says, "Hey, thanks again for changing my tire earlier. I really appreciate it." And I'm like, "Uh, no problem, man." And then he says, "By the way, I'm a private investigator, and I was testing you to see if you were a good Samaritan. You passed with flying colors." And I'm like, "What?! You were testing me?! Why didn't you just tell me that earlier?!"

And he's like, "Well, I wanted to see if you would actually help someone in need, without expecting anything in return. And you did. So, I'm going to give you a reward for your good deed." And then he hands me a $500 gift card to a local restaurant. I'm like, "Whoa, thanks man! That's really cool of you."

TL;DR: I stopped to help a guy with a flat tire, and ended up changing it for him. Later, I saw him driving a new car and started to feel uneasy, thinking I might have stolen it. But it turned out he was a private investigator testing my good Samaritan skills, and he rewarded me with a $500 gift card. I felt relieved and happy that I had passed the test.

TITLE: I [23M] feel disconnected from my three-year-long relationship with my [25F] gf.

POST: I apologise in advance but this will be a long one.

Over the last few months, I feel as though I'm just a passenger in my relationship with my 25 y/o gf.

We have been together for three years, but aren't living together yet - because our job situations don't lend themselves to moving in. We have discussed it and we would like to when the time is right. (I'm in an entry-level position with opportunities to move in six to twelve months time and she has just secured a management job in a retail store.)

I feel disconnected from her because of how she has been when we communicate.

We came back from a two-week vacation a month ago - the holiday was great. But since we have come back it's as if she's not making much of an effort for our relationship.

Beforehand we used to text each other romantic/lovey things all the time. Now if I ask her to send me a 'nice' text she puts something generic or says she doesn't know what to put because she doesn't want to repeat herself - repeating herself would be hard to do because she doesn't say things in the first place.

One example - last night I told her I really wanted to have sex with her and her reply was along the lines of lol really?

Our sex life isn't great. The last time we did was on holiday - so just over a month ago. I saw her at the weekend and we had planned to do stuff but she wanted to watch films instead and then before we realised it I had to take her home.

Should I be worried about this lack of intimacy, or is it a common occurrence in relationships which have been this long?

TL;DR: I feel disconnected from my 3-year-long relationship with my 25 y/o gf. We used to be very romantic, but since we got back from holiday, she's not making much of an effort. Our communication is lacking and our sex life is non-existent. Should I be worried?

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're feeling a bit neglected and that's understandable. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Sometimes people get busy or stressed and forget to prioritize their relationship."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're not even living together yet, and you're already feeling disconnected? Give her some space and time. You're not entitled to constant romance and intimacy."
* "I'm in a similar situation with my partner. We've been together for 5 years and it's like we're just going through the motions. I think it's normal to go through phases where you feel disconnected. Have you tried doing something new together or having a conversation about how you're feeling?"
* "I think you should be worried. A lack of intimacy and romance can be a sign of a bigger issue. Have you considered couples therapy?"
* "I think you're overthinking this. She's just busy with work and life, and you're reading too much into it. Don't be so needy and give her some space."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's not even aware of how her behavior is affecting you. And maybe you can work together to find ways to reconnect and strengthen your relationship."

TITLE: TIFU by screaming at a random lady on the phone at work

POST: So, this happened yesterday and I didn't have time to write out until now. A little background – I work for a call center that reviews car insurance policies, mostly for the renewals; we do both inbound and outbound calling. I also have the wonderful privilege of working from home. I have 2 cats and a 10-month old German Shepherd/Lab mix puppy, the latter I usually keep with me in my home office to separate her from terrorizing the cats while I'm trying to work.

There I am, working like normal. Pup decides it's a good time to be real annoying and jump everywhere, making dumb puppy noises. Now, all of our calls are recorded and we are "coached" on 5 calls per week. These are just weekly reviews of 5 supposedly random calls that we are graded on by our managers. I must do well in order to keep my status of no pants, lay in bed all day work flow, or just keep my job in general (cuss words would get me fired.)

Anyway, here she is going nuts and then an outbound call pops up. I introduce myself and begin explaining the reason for my call, whilst fighting off this 80lb demon dog child, and right as I'm done with my introductory spiel, I press the mute button on my headset and yell, in my angriest dad voice, "GO LAYYYYYYY DOOOOOOWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!!!!" She saunters off and I direct my attention back to the call, looking down to press the mute back off and noticing that in fact, the mute button had not been pressed and I just told this random lady to go lay down after asking about her car insurance. I heard an "Uhhhhh…." on the line and promptly hung up in my embarrassed and anxious panic after the damage was done.

If this call gets "randomly" selected to be reviewed this week, I could be in some deep shit.

TL;DR: I yelled at a random lady on the phone at work, telling her to go lay down, and then hung up. I'm in trouble.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "improve" my roommate's cooking

POST: So I've been living with my roommate for a few months now, and while we get along great, I've been noticing that her cooking skills are... lacking. I mean, I'm no chef or anything, but I've been trying to help out and offer some suggestions.

The other day, she made this huge pot of what she called "chili" for dinner. It was basically just a bunch of canned beans and tomatoes mixed together with some ground beef. I mean, it was edible, but it was definitely not the most flavorful dish I've ever had.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and "improve" the recipe. I snuck into the kitchen while she was out and added some of my own spices and seasonings to the pot. I thought it would be a nice gesture, and maybe even help her out a bit.

Big mistake.

When she came back into the kitchen, she was furious. She said that I had ruined her dish and that she had been trying to perfect the recipe for weeks. She was really upset, and I felt bad for what I had done.

I tried to apologize and explain that I was just trying to help, but she wasn't having it. She told me that she didn't need my help and that I should just stick to my own cooking.

I felt really bad about the whole situation, and I didn't know how to make it right. I ended up just apologizing and promising to respect her cooking from now on.

I guess I learned a valuable lesson about not messing with someone else's cooking. Has anyone else ever tried to "improve" someone else's recipe and ended up regretting it?

TITLE: TIFU by trying to "help" my friend with her math homework

POST: So I've been friends with this girl for a few years now, and we've always been pretty close. We've had our ups and downs, but we've always managed to work through things.

Recently, she's been having some trouble with her math homework. I know I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I figured I could at least try to help her out. So, I offered to sit down with her and go over the problems together.

Big mistake.

As we were working on the problems, I started to get a little frustrated. I mean, I'm not exactly a math genius, and I was having trouble understanding some of the concepts. But I didn't want to admit defeat, so I just kept trying to power through.

I ended up making things worse, and my friend got really upset with me. She said that I was making her feel stupid and that I wasn't even trying to help her. I felt bad, and I didn't know how to make it right.

I ended up just apologizing and telling her that I was sorry for not being able to help her. I promised to be more careful in the future and to not try to "help" her with things that I'm not good at.

I guess I learned a valuable lesson about not trying to "help" someone with something that I'm not qualified to do. Has anyone else ever tried to "help" someone with something and ended up regretting it?

POST: So I work in a marketing department, and one of my coworkers is responsible for creating presentations for our team. I've seen her presentations before, and while they're not bad, I've always thought that they could be improved.

So, I decided to take it upon myself to "improve" her latest presentation. I snuck into the conference room and started making changes to the slides, adding in some of my own graphics and animations.

Big mistake.

When my coworker came in to present, she was furious. She said that I had ruined her presentation and that she had spent hours working on it. She was really

TITLE: How do I [19/F] find self-worth in the dull relationship I have with my partner? [25/M]

POST: We've been together for over 2 years, but just lately things haven't been great. As soon as we get home, the TV's on, laptop's are on and we barely speak a word to each other. Without sounding harsh, I feel that I genuinely make all the effort, but he's not so interested.

For example, I'll start up a conversation, and he quite literally stares at the TV and won't respond. When I tell him I would like a response and I'm wondering if he heard me, he says he "has nothing to say". I don't interrogate him, I just talk about different topics I have in mind!

And then he says we'll go out for a walk together, go to the beach etc and when the day comes to do these things, he ends up telling me he doesn't want to. 

I have depression, panic attacks and my dad passed away end of last year so I'm not in a position where I feel overly confident about myself. If he looks at the TV whilst I'm talking to him, I take it to heart. When he spends more time making plans with his friends than he does with me, it really hurts me. 

He knows all of this, and that I've put him on a pedestal because he's all I have right now. I've put college, Uni and my passion for travelling on permanent hold because those things weren't going in the same direction as he was, and he knows this.

Is he taking advantage of the fact he knows he can get away with an easy life because I'll never leave? To me, he's a genuinely sensitive and loving person, but I think he favours doing things the easy way and making life as comfortable for himself as possible. How do I resolve all of this?

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old girl in a 2-year relationship with a 25-year-old guy. We've been drifting apart and I feel like I'm the only one making an effort. I have depression, anxiety, and my dad passed away recently. I'm struggling to find self-worth in this relationship and feel like he's taking advantage of me. How do I resolve this?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really drained and unappreciated. Have you considered talking to your partner about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about what you need from the relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. It's also important to prioritize your own self-care and make time for things that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of the relationship."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, it sounds like you're in a toxic relationship. You deserve so much better than someone who doesn't make an effort to communicate with you or prioritize your feelings. I would encourage you to take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through your depression and anxiety. You are worthy of love and respect, and you don't have to settle for anything less."
3. **u/anonymous123**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure of what to do.

It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if it means ending the relationship. Remember that you are worthy of love and respect, and you deserve to be happy."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "OP, it sounds like you're in a relationship that's not meeting your emotional needs.

TITLE: Reddit can pull some great advice out of almost anything, what can you say about my life?

POST: I'm a seventeen year old going into grade twelve, and I don't know anything about my future... I really don't know where I'm going career-wise. That's one thing; I also have a girlfriend of 2+ years and we have yet to kiss, I haven't gotten even my learner's license yet, and throughout my life I have refused to use any drugs/alcohol to this point.

Now, I've been really satisfied with all this untill today, when an old friend and I got together and met up with our third friend (who turns out to now smoke weed/is now on a two month light-every-day streak). This lead to a messed up day of following them to dealers and near fights, small town gangs and free kijiji kittens, all leading to getting some friends together to light up.

I did nothing but follow and listen to them today, and what an average day for any one of them amazed me. I left and thought about my current life, and now I'm here on askreddit while laying in bed.

Basically, I want to know how normal I am.

TL;DR: 17 year old, unsure about future, never kissed girlfriend, never gotten license, never used drugs/alcohol, but today got caught up in a wild day with friends who use drugs and I'm feeling lost.

TITLE: I (20F) think I want to break up with live in boyfriend (20M) of two years.. not sure how to do it

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, and living together since we were together around 6 months. 
Everything was awesome, we rarely fought and there has rarely been any huge issues aside from a few times I've come across him text messaging other women inappropriate things, which he apologized for and I forgave him, etc. (I'm surprised i did, i have serious trust issues)

Now, lately, I've been feeling very upset and frustrated, and generally unhappy.

I feel as though I need to be on my own, I want to travel and explore and do all kinds of things that he's not interested in. I find myself thinking things like "if I was single I'd go do this" or "if I became single again I'd go here or try this" & I'm realising that if I ever want to do those things, it likely won't be while I'm with him.

But, here's the hard part - I have no idea if he feels the same way - he knows something is wrong because I've completely shut down over the weekend, my mind is so jumbled and I'm so confused that I didn't eat anything yesterday so I'm obviously not feeling well. Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.

Don't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore. I feel held back, trapped! I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..

So what I need is advice - How do I do it? We live together so this will be incredibly hard... I'm so scared to break his heart, I'm scared he'll get angry. I'm terrible at confrontation, so i'll likely break down and be bawling before I even get any words out...

Please help :(

TL;DR: I've been feeling unhappy and trapped in my 2-year relationship, I think I want to break up but I'm scared of hurting my boyfriend and don't know how to do it since we live together. I'm looking for advice on how to approach this conversation.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21F] has been incredibly controlling lately, what should I [19F] do?

POST: I have been with my girlfriend for 1 year and a half, and I love her dearly. I truly believe she is my soulmate and that I will spend the rest of my life with her. However, she has been incredibly controlling lately and I don't know what to do about it. 

She goes to college about 2- 2 1/2 hours away from where I go to college, so I see her when she comes home on weekends. When she's up at school, she has to know where I am, and if I'm not in my room doing homework, she's mad that I'm not talking to her. If I'm with my friends at all she gets very angry because I could instead be talking to her. And by talking to her, she means like Skype. I text and snapchat her pretty regularly when with friends. She will claim I am making her depressed and anxious, and will be very distant toward me if I don't talk to her the night prior. The most ridiculous thing she's done in regards to control is telling me she drank and drove the night before because I wasn't talking to her so she wanted to spite me. 

I told her if she doesn't stop I will break up with her. She told me she couldn't and within 5 minutes she called me and begged for me to come back to her house because she would do everything in her power to fix it. 

According to her, this controlling thing is because she has severe anxiety. She is so insecure and anxious, so craves my attention to reassure her. Though this may sound like bullshit, she legitimately does have really bad anxiety and gets panic attacks very frequently.  She claims once she comes home from school (she graduates in a month) that she won't feel this way anymore because then we will be in the same city. 

I love her to death and don't want to break up, but this situation is stressing me quite a lot. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has been controlling, wants to know where I am and who I'm with, gets mad if I'm not talking to her, claims it's because of her anxiety. I told her to stop or I'll break up, but she begged me to come back and promised to fix it. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "OP, you're 19 and she's 21. You're still young and don't need this kind of drama in your life. You deserve better. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being."
* "I understand that she has anxiety, but that's no excuse for controlling behavior. You need to have a serious conversation with her about how her actions are affecting you. Make it clear that you're willing to work through her anxiety with her, but you won't tolerate the controlling behavior."
* "OP, you're being really understanding and empathetic towards her anxiety, which is great. However, you also need to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. Have a conversation with her about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. It's okay to say no to her demands for attention."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to work through her anxiety with her, but you also need to think about your own emotional well-being. Are you happy in this relationship? Are you feeling fulfilled? If not, maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you."
* "OP, I think you need to take a step back and assess whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. You deserve to be with someone who respects your boundaries and doesn't try to control you. Don't be afraid to walk away if this relationship isn't making you happy."

**Red flags:**

* Controlling behavior: girlfriend demands to know where OP is and who they're with, gets mad if OP isn't talking to her, and tries to guilt trip OP into staying in the relationship.
* Emotional manipulation: girlfriend claims that OP's lack of attention is causing her depression and anxiety, and tries to use this to control OP's behavior.
* Gaslighting: girlfriend tells OP that they're being unreasonable and that their concerns are unfounded, and tries to make OP doubt their own perceptions.
* Lack of respect for boundaries: girlfriend doesn't respect OP's need for space and autonomy, and tries to dictate how OP should spend their time.

**Recommendations:**

* OP should have a serious conversation with their girlfriend about the controlling behavior and how it's affecting them.
* OP should set clear boundaries and communicate their needs and expectations to their girlfriend.
* OP should prioritize their own emotional well-being and consider whether this relationship is truly healthy for them.
* OP should consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help them navigate this situation.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my boyfriend [18 M] of 9 months, He loves me, I said I do too, now I don't know if I still do?

POST: Wanna keep details brief: Both guys, been together for around 9 months now. Somewhere around 4 months in we start saying "I love you", and at the time I assumed I really did because I've never been in love before.

Things have developed and he often says how madly in love with me he is, but I don't feel I can say the same back, heck I don't think I really do love him.

Don't get me wrong, he is AMAZING and I really think he's the nicest guy around, and this relationship is awesome. I want us to still be in a relationship but I can't honestly say I love him, and he's started noticing I don't reply "I love you too".

How can I go back on what I said in the past AND STILL keep this relationship?

TL;DR: 19M, 9 months in with 18M boyfriend, said I love you back, now I don't know if I really do, how to keep relationship without lying?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Honestly, it's okay to admit you don't feel the same way. You can't force feelings, and it's better to be honest with yourself and your partner. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. It might be uncomfortable, but it's better than leading him on."
2. **relationshipgoals**: "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you said 'I love you' in the first place. Was it just a feeling of comfort and security with him, or was it a genuine emotional connection? If it was the former, it's okay to re-evaluate your feelings. But if it was the latter, maybe you just need to work on deepening your emotional connection with him."
3. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're overthinking this. You said 'I love you' because you felt comfortable and happy with him, and that's okay. You don't have to be in love with someone to be in a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Just be honest with him about how you're feeling, and I'm sure he'll understand."
4. **confused_couple**: "I'm in a similar situation with my partner. We said 'I love you' pretty early on, and now I'm not sure if I really do. I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. It might be scary, but it's better than leading him on and potentially hurting him in the long run."
5. **relationship_coach**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You don't have to be in love with someone to be in a healthy relationship. Focus on building a strong connection with your partner, and the feelings will follow. Don't worry too much about what you said in the past, just focus on moving forward and being honest with each other."

---

**Conclusion:** The OP is struggling with feelings of uncertainty and guilt about saying "I love you" to his boyfriend, despite not truly feeling the same way. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from encouraging honesty and self-reflection to suggesting that it's okay to re-evaluate feelings and focus on building a strong connection with the partner. Ultimately, the OP will need to have an open and honest conversation with his boyfriend about his feelings and work together to navigate this challenging situation.

TITLE: So unfortunately I turned in 3 huge assignments on friday RIGHT after the teacher left...

POST: So last week, I had 3 huge assignments due for one of my teachers. These assignments have made the past week pretty much one of the most stressful weeks of my life, and I didn't even finish until Friday just about when school ended. When I went to go to her to turn it in, it turns out she had health problems and checked out 30 minutes before class ended, leaving me in what I would call an FML state of mind. I rushed to the library and emailed my teacher as soon as possible explaining the situation... but so far she hasn't responded. And it's Sunday. I'm worried sick, Reddit, and I have no idea what I should do. Surely she must understand and not flunk me just because I barely missed her leaving her class... but I'm in doubt. What should I do?

TL;DR: I turned in 3 huge assignments on Friday, but the teacher left 30 minutes before class ended. I emailed her explaining the situation, but she hasn't responded yet. I'm worried sick and don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Don't stress too much, OP. It's not like you intentionally tried to miss the deadline. If your teacher is reasonable, she'll understand the situation. Just keep an eye on your email and wait for her response. If you don't hear back by Wednesday, you can try calling the school or visiting her office hours to clarify the situation."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Oh no, the horror! You almost missed the teacher's departure! I'm sure she's still traumatized by the experience. Just kidding, OP. Seriously, though, it's not like you're the first person to almost miss a deadline. Try not to worry too much and just wait for her response. If you don't hear back, you can always try contacting the school or department head for guidance."
3. **ConcernedCitizen**: "OP, I feel for you! It's understandable that you're worried, but try not to jump to conclusions. Your teacher might be dealing with personal issues or be on a well-deserved break. Keep an eye on your email and wait for her response. If you don't hear back, you can try reaching out to the school or department head for guidance. Remember that your teacher is human too, and they might be dealing with their own stressors."
4. **GrammarNazi**: "OP, I think you meant to say 'I turned in three huge assignments on Friday RIGHT after the teacher left the classroom' instead of 'I turned in three huge assignments on Friday RIGHT after the teacher left.' The teacher left the school, not the classroom. Just a minor correction, but it might help clarify the situation for your teacher."
5. **OptimisticOllie**: "Hey OP, don't worry too much! It's not the end of the world if your teacher doesn't respond right away. Just keep an eye on your email and wait for her response. If you don't hear back, you can always try contacting the school or department head for guidance. Remember that your teacher is human too, and they might be dealing with their own stressors. Try to stay positive and focus on the things you can control. Good luck, and I hope everything works out for you!"

TITLE: I (f20) think I'm in an emotional relationship with my friend (m20). I don't know how I should handle this.

POST: I have a really close friend who is a guy. We've been friends for 2 years and we're neighbors who spend most of our weeknights together. He is honestly one of the greatest people I know-- I trust him with my life. We're moving in together (platonic) in a few weeks in a new city and we're both extremely excited, but I'm nervous about our relationship.

People tease us already that we're dating and his mom is convinced that we're together. We usually just deny it and laugh it off, but I feel like there's some subtext that we're not addressing. We'll playfully tease each other or he'll tickle me randomly when we're hanging out; we're pretty touchy/cuddly with each other but nothing over the top or scandalous. We talk about everything and I feel it's safe to say we're best friends. 

There have been moments where I've wanted to kiss him and be relationship cuddly, but there's always been something holding me back. Like, I can't picture having sex with him at all (not that he's unattractive, I just literally can't see it). I want/can picture kissing him, but the second I try and imagine something more sexual, I can't.  

Futhermore, I can't say I'm too thrilled about him getting a girlfriend either. It's not like I'd ever sabotage anything for him, but I'm not too keen on the idea of sharing him or spending less time with him. I know that mindset is unhealthy, so I'm trying my best to keep it under wraps. 

I'm afraid I'm in an emotional relationship with him and I'm concerned about what might happen when we move in together. Any advice or opinion would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old woman who's been friends with a 20-year-old guy for 2 years. We're moving in together and I'm worried that I might be in an emotional relationship with him. I don't know how to handle this or what to do next.

**Comments:**

1. "Honestly, it sounds like you're in a deep emotional connection with your friend, and that's not uncommon. The fact that you're worried about what might happen when you move in together is a good sign that you're aware of your feelings. Have an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Be honest with yourself and with him about your desires and boundaries. It's possible that he feels the same way, and you can explore the possibility of a romantic relationship together."
2. "I think you're overthinking this. You're friends, and you're moving in together as friends. It's not uncommon for friends to be close and affectionate, and it doesn't necessarily mean you're in a romantic relationship. Just enjoy the friendship and the new living situation, and see where things go naturally."
3. "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you in love with your friend, or are you just comfortable with him? If you're not sure, then maybe you shouldn't be moving in together. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel loved and desired, not just someone you're comfortable with."
4. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to have feelings for someone, even if it's not romantic. You can still have a deep emotional connection with someone without it being romantic. Just be honest with yourself and with your friend about how you're feeling, and see where things go."
5. "I think you should talk to your friend about how you're feeling. Be honest and open with him, and see how he reacts. If he's not interested in a romantic relationship, then maybe you should re-evaluate your feelings and consider whether you're truly happy with just being friends. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel loved and desired."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are a mix of opinions and advice, ranging from being honest with your friend and exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship to taking a step back and re-evaluating your feelings. Some commenters suggest that it's okay to have deep emotional connections with friends without it being romantic, while others encourage the OP to be honest with themselves and their friend about their desires and boundaries. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP to decide how to handle their feelings and the situation.

TITLE: My ex (27f) and I (27m) mutually broke up about a week ago and she is already trying to find a new relationship

POST: My ex and I were in a relationship for one year. We now discovered many differences between us and decided to stop our relationship (in a rather negative way, i.e. big fight). She said that she got nothing from this relationship and wondered why she got involved with me in the first place.

One week later, she posted on fb that she is looking for a new relationship. And I feel very sad about that. Although our relationship was troublesome toward the end, it has its moments that I still cherish. I did care about her and wanted to be with her while I was in a relationship with her. But it seemed like she did not feel the same way. Her wanting a new relationship so quickly hurts my feelings because our relationship appeared not to be that meaningful to her.

* Was what she has done right? or was she being inconsiderate/insensitive?
* Am I supposed to be feeling like this? Am I too needy/clingy?
* How should I cope with this?
* I'm still "friends" with her on fb, should I just remove her? I little part in me still wants to go back to her so I don't really want to cut all connections to her.

If you could be the judge and analyze my situation and provide some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. I can give more information in the comment if needed.

TL;DR: My ex and I broke up a week ago and she is already looking for a new relationship. I'm feeling sad and hurt because I still care about her and our relationship. I'm wondering if I'm being too needy or clingy and how I should cope with this.

---

**Analysis and Feedback:**

The OP is feeling hurt and sad about his ex's quick move to find a new relationship. He's wondering if he's being too needy or clingy and how he should cope with this.

**Initial Thoughts:**

* It's normal to feel hurt and sad when a relationship ends, especially if it was a significant one.
* The fact that his ex is already looking for a new relationship may be a sign that she didn't feel the same level of emotional investment in the relationship as he did.
* The OP's feelings are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge and process them.

**Questions and Concerns:**

* Was what she has done right? or was she being inconsiderate/insensitive?
	+ It's possible that she didn't realize the impact her actions would have on him, or she may not have considered his feelings at all. Either way, it's not necessarily "right" or "wrong," but rather a reflection of her priorities and values.
* Am I supposed to be feeling like this? Am I too needy/clingy?
	+ No, it's not necessarily "supposed" to feel this way. The OP's feelings are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge and process them. Being "needy" or "clingy" is not necessarily a bad thing; it's a natural response to the end of a relationship.
* How should I cope with this?
	+ The OP could try to focus on self-care, engage in activities that bring him joy, and surround himself with supportive friends and family. It may also be helpful to reflect on the relationship and what he learned from it.

**Recommendations:**

* Consider taking a break from social media or limiting his exposure to his ex's posts and updates.
* Focus on self-care and engaging in activities that bring him joy and fulfillment.
* Reflect on the relationship and what he learned from it. This can help him process his emotions and gain closure.
* Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about his feelings and concerns. Sometimes just sharing his emotions with someone who cares about him can help him feel heard and validated.

**Final Thoughts:**

The OP's feelings are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge and process them. It's normal to feel hurt and sad when a relationship ends, especially if it was a significant one. The key is to focus on self-care, engage in activities that bring him joy, and surround himself with supportive friends and family. With time and reflection, the OP can work through his emotions and move forward in a positive direction.

TITLE: Tried to teach my dog to play dead. Instead gave him a complex.

POST: A few months back, I was reading up on how to teach your dog to play dead.  The whole guiding him onto his back with a treat, then reinforcing with praise and reward.  I figured I'd give it a shot.

So I get home from work and get down to business.  Ozzy's catching on pretty quickly.  Within 10 minutes, I have him rolling onto his back on command.  I was pointing my finger at him and saying, "BANG!" as a cue.  Suddenly though, as he's lying on his back, he pees a little.  (In my excitement to teach him a new trick, I forgot to let him out to pee!)  He's obviously ashamed of himself, even though I didn't get mad at him as it was my fault.

After we've cleaned up and gone out for a pee break, I attempt the trick again.  Point my finger at him and say "BANG".  Ozzy tucks his ears back and slinks underneath my computer desk.  No amount of calling, bribing, or coaxing gets him out until I leave the room.  Since then, he gets stressed when you make a finger gun at him, or if you say the word bang.  He will often try to slink under the computer desk or go into his kennel.

So my theories on what might be going on:

* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him
* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud "BANG" is too harsh of a cue word
* The word "BANG" sounds too close to the word "Bad" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.

In any case, it's been months and I can't even bait him to lie on his back anymore.  Get him to lie down and try to move a treat across his shoulder?  He just goes "NOPE" and gets up and looks for his safety desk.

TL;DR: I tried to teach my dog to play dead, but he got stressed and now associates the cue with negative experiences.  He'll no longer lie on his back and gets anxious when I make a finger gun or say the word "BANG".

---

**Comments:**

* "Ahaha, I can just imagine Ozzy slinking under the computer desk.  Sorry to hear it didn't work out, but it's hilarious that he's now traumatized by the word 'BANG'!"
* "I think it's a combination of all three theories.  Dogs can be super sensitive to sounds and associations, and it's possible that the 'BANG' sound is too intense for him.  Maybe try using a different cue word or sound?"
* "I've had similar issues with my dog and it's usually because I'm using the wrong cue or word.  Try using a different word or phrase, like 'Down' or 'Bang-bang' (with a softer tone).  Also, make sure to reward him for calm behavior, not just lying down."
* "I think it's the association with wetting himself.  Dogs have a strong sense of smell and can associate certain smells with certain experiences.  Maybe try using a different treat or reward to help him associate the cue with something positive?"
* "I've seen this before where dogs get stuck on a negative association and it's hard to break.  You might need to start from scratch and re-train him with a new cue and reward system.  Good luck!"

TITLE: I [23F] contacting biological family for the first time

POST: Hey all, 

I wanted to get some advice on how to reach out to biological family members that I've never met. Basically, my mom got pregnant with me with her boyfriend of three years and he told her he doesn't like kids and didn't want to be involved with raising me, which I don't have any hard feelings about. My mom remarried and my step dad adopted me, so I had a father figure who treated me like his own. 

I've always been curious about my biological side of the family though and found them on Facebook. I have never reached out because I didn't think I was ready but recently have been thinking about contacting them. I know about a half sister I have from my bio dad's first marriage and she's in her thirties and lives really close by. My bio dad lives across the country. Would it be weird reaching out to her over Facebook? Or should I contact my biological dad first? I don't know if she knows about me so I don't want to shock her with the info or create a riff in the family. I'm really just a stranger to them.

TL;DR: I'm 23 and found my biological family on Facebook. I'm thinking of reaching out to my half sister who lives close by, but I'm not sure if I should contact my biological dad first or if it's weird to reach out to her over Facebook.

TITLE: I [19/f] am going to college soon and my boyfriend [18, m] of a year doesn't seem to mind.

POST: So, my boyfriend [18/m] and I [19/f] have been together for over a year. We are very in love...but things are going to be changing soon. I am a senior in high school and he is a junior (we both started school late). I am applying for college and will more likely than not be out of state. He has said that he is ok with that and wants to stay together no matter what. We seem to talk more about him going to college than me...when I am the one leaving in 6 months. He seems less upset than me about my leaving. Sometimes I just think, what's the point of staying together? Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time. I sometimes get into phases where I get really insecure, especially in our relationship. This may be one of those phases...but it feels different. I need advice. Am I blowing all this way out of proportion?

TL;DR: I'm going to college soon and my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind. He's more focused on his own college plans than mine. He's also planning to leave for an internship before I leave for college. I'm feeling insecure and unsure about our relationship.

RESPONSES:

1. **throwaway123456**: Hey OP, I think you're not blowing it out of proportion at all. It's normal to feel insecure in a long-distance relationship, especially when it's not your choice. It sounds like your boyfriend is more focused on his own plans and hasn't really considered the impact it will have on your relationship. You deserve to feel heard and considered in this situation. Have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. It's okay to express your needs and boundaries in a relationship.

2. **skeptical_squirrel**: OP, I think you're right to be upset. Your boyfriend's lack of consideration and communication is a red flag. He's not taking your feelings into account, and that's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who prioritizes your needs and feelings. Don't be afraid to re-evaluate your relationship and consider what's best for you.

3. **relationship_ruth**: OP, I think you're experiencing a normal reaction to a big change. It's natural to feel insecure and uncertain about your relationship. However, it's also important to remember that your boyfriend is not intentionally trying to hurt you. He's just focused on his own plans, and that's okay. Try to have a calm and rational conversation with him about your feelings. Ask him how he plans to stay connected and maintain your relationship while you're apart. It's possible that he's not thinking about the logistics of your relationship, but that doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.

4. **long_distance_lady**: OP, I've been in your shoes before, and I can tell you that it's tough. But it's not impossible. My boyfriend and I were apart for a year, and we made it work. We had to make an effort to stay connected, and it wasn't always easy. But we prioritized our relationship and made time for each other. If you're willing to put in the work, you can make this long-distance thing work too. Just remember to communicate openly and honestly with your boyfriend, and don't be afraid to express your feelings and needs.

5. **relationship_realist**: OP, I think you're overthinking this. Your boyfriend is 18, and he's not going to be perfect. He's going to make mistakes, and you're going to have to learn to forgive him. If you're really unhappy in the relationship, then maybe it's time to re-evaluate. But if you're willing to work through this and communicate openly with your boyfriend, then you might be surprised at how strong your relationship can be. Just remember that relationships take work, and sometimes that means compromising and making sacrifices. You're not alone in this, and you can get through it.

TITLE: Me [17 F] with my boyfriend [17 M] He is being mean to me and it's my fault

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together little over a year. I love him very much and I think he's a wonderful person. Lately he's been very mean to me and it hurts but I do deserve it. Early in the relationship I sexted an old friend. My boyfriend agreed to stay with me and move past it. 

Since then I have cut off my relationship with that friend and he has access to all my social media. I have not messaged anyone like that at all or done anything suspicious. I feel very guilty over what I did and take 100% of the blame. 

These past few weeks he has been threatening to leave me, making me beg him to stay, calling me stupid, weak, a whore and ugly. I know I did a bad things so I am putting up with it because I know he gets angry about it. He does this when we fight, but otherwise he is the sweetest person I know. I really mean it, this is the only bad side to him. 

Recently I've been feeling really depressed and bad about myself. I'm scared to open up anymore because I don't want to be yelled at or lose him.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is being mean to me because of something I did in the past (sexted an old friend). I feel guilty and take full responsibility. I'm scared to open up because I don't want to lose him.

---

This post is a classic example of a toxic relationship. The OP (original poster) is taking full responsibility for her actions and feels guilty about what she did, which is a positive sign. However, her boyfriend's behavior is unacceptable and abusive. He is using his power and control over her to manipulate her into staying in the relationship and to make her feel bad about herself.

The OP's feelings of depression and self-doubt are a direct result of her boyfriend's behavior, and it's important to recognize that his actions are not a reflection of her worth as a person. It's also important to note that the OP's boyfriend is not a healthy partner, and his behavior is not acceptable.

The OP should consider seeking support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional to help her work through her feelings and develop a plan to leave the relationship. It's also important for her to remember that she is not alone and that there are people who care about her and want to support her.

In the meantime, the OP should try to set boundaries with her boyfriend and prioritize her own emotional well-being. She should not have to tolerate his abuse and should not feel guilty for wanting to leave the relationship. It's important for her to remember that she deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, and that she is worthy of love and happiness.

TITLE: I really need some words of wisdom.

POST: Me 18 her 20. We were so happy together relationship ended and just a couple weeks ago we started talking again back to the way it was it was great. She randomly tells me today that we we stopped talking her ex was talking to her about getting engaged. I live this girl so much I tell her do what you will make you happiest. She tells me that I treat her better than he does and she told him that. 

Do I let her try and be happy with another man or do I fight to try and have her back. This woman is the first girl I feel on love with and first I made love with. She has told me for weeks she wants to be back with me. But the other guy wants to marry her.

I just want her to be Happy no matter what she does but I don't want to let her go.

TL;DR: 18-year-old guy's 20-year-old girlfriend tells him she's considering getting engaged to her ex, who treats her worse than him. He's torn between letting her go and fighting to win her back.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's already made up her mind. You can't compete with the promise of marriage and a future with someone else. It's time to accept that she's moved on and focus on your own happiness."
* "I think you're being too selfless. You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you, not someone who's settling for you because they can't have the other guy. You're worth more than that."
* "It's not about being selfish or selfless, it's about being honest with yourself. If you truly believe you're the better choice for her, then have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. But if she's already made up her mind, then it's time to move on."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so invested in this relationship. Are you really in love with her, or are you just trying to prove something to yourself? Either way, it's time to take a step back and prioritize your own emotional well-being."
* "It's okay to be hurt, but don't let your emotions cloud your judgment. If she's made up her mind, then it's time to accept it and move on. You can't force someone to love you back, and you definitely can't compete with someone else's proposal."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about what she wants and what she's looking for in a relationship. If she's genuinely considering getting engaged to her ex, then it's time to reevaluate whether you're compatible. You deserve someone who wants to be with you for the right reasons, not just because they can't have someone else."

TITLE: Me (21m) dated a 19f for a month, i ruined things and pushed her out of my life, no i want to be friends again what should i do?

POST: Hey, 21 m here, dated a 19f for a month,

So a few months ago I met an amazing person, she was everything i could have asked for, we started dating, and i really rushed things ( sexually and labeling whatever we had). After around month she ended things with me. And 5 months later i'm justt starting to get over her. I want to apologize to her for so many things but i feel its wayy too late that i could be giving out the image that i want her back, i don't.

I want her in my life again as she's an amazing person and a great friend
But i feel its wayyy too late to apologize to her after 5 months of barely speaking to her.

Should i try to make amends?
Or should i accept the fact thats its over and just get her completely out of my life even though its all my fault?

TL;DR: Dated a 19f for a month, ruined things, and pushed her out of my life. Want to apologize and be friends again, but feel it's too late. Should I try to make amends or accept it's over?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's too late. You had your chance and blew it. If she's not willing to talk to you after 5 months, it's clear she's moved on. You need to respect her boundaries and give her space."
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to take responsibility for your actions and accept that you ruined things. Apologizing now is just a way to try to salvage your ego, not to make things right with her."
* "I think you should try to make amends, but not because you want her back romantically. You should do it because you genuinely want to make things right and be friends. However, you need to be prepared for the possibility that she may not be interested in talking to you again."
* "I think you should focus on yourself and your own personal growth. You clearly have some issues to work through before you're ready for a healthy relationship. Apologizing to her now is just a distraction from your own problems."
* "I think you should send her a message apologizing for your actions and explaining how you've grown as a person. But be prepared for the possibility that she may not respond or may not want to talk to you again. You need to respect her decision and move on."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP (original poster) is seeking advice on whether to try to make amends with his ex-girlfriend after 5 months of barely speaking to her.
* Many commenters agree that it's too late and that the OP needs to accept that he ruined things and move on.
* Some commenters suggest that the OP should try to make amends, but only if he's genuinely willing to make things right and be friends, and not just because he wants her back romantically.
* The OP is advised to focus on his own personal growth and development before trying to rekindle a relationship with his ex.

TITLE: Relationship of conflicting faiths.

POST: So I've been in a relationship with this girl (Me m/18 her f/17) for about 2 months. Prior to that we dated for a little over 3 months nearly exactly a year ago. The first relationship ended abruptly when her father banned us from seeing each other because I'm an atheist and her father is a pastor and her faith mean an awful lot to her. 

This time her father has been a whole lot less protective of her by allowing us to be together. Unfortunately he still doesn't trust me at all. We aren't allowed to be together alone. My mother or some member of her family have to be with us at almost all times. If we go out in public her twin sister comes with us almost always. He has told me before that this has everything to do with my faith. In the beginning I totally understood his distrust but I thought it would get better over time. Prior to the relation ship we were friends for about 2 years and I had many conversations with her father on various topics.

This alone would be fine but she also pushes me very hard to change various mannerisms that I have. When she's around I can't really be myself at all. I find myself censoring myself very very often because she would get mad at me. Whenever I listen to my music around her she starts to get uncomfortable whenever the music has profanities or any themes really more than "G rated"(I listen to lots of punk rock if that gives you a better image).

I really like this girl but I find myself not being able to be myself around her at all. Anything that I would usually do/say around my friends is everything that she disapproves of. So what do I do? I honestly can't figure out what to do. Any help would be awesome! If you need any clarifications just ask.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's father doesn't trust me because I'm an atheist, and she pushes me to change my behavior and music preferences. I feel like I'm losing myself in the relationship.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like her father is still trying to control her and dictate who she can and can't be with. That's not healthy for anyone involved. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's not even aware of the impact her father's rules are having on your relationship."
2. **relationshipadvice**: "I think you need to have a serious talk with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's not fair to you that you can't be yourself around her. You deserve to be with someone who accepts you for who you are, not tries to change you. And honestly, if her father is still trying to control her, that's a major red flag. You deserve better than that."
3. **atheistproud**: "I'm an atheist too, and I can totally relate to the feeling of being judged or disapproved of because of your beliefs. But here's the thing: you can't change who you are to make someone else happy. You need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about what you're willing to compromise on and what you're not. If you're not comfortable censoring yourself or changing your music preferences, then maybe this relationship isn't the right one for you."
4. **concernedfriend**: "I think you should also consider talking to her father about how you're feeling. Maybe he's not aware of the impact his rules are having on your relationship, and a conversation could help clear the air. But at the same time, you need to be prepared for the possibility that he may not change his mind, and you need to think about whether that's something you're willing to accept."
5. **punkrockfan**: "Dude, I feel you. I'm a punk rock fan too, and I know how hard it is to find someone who understands and accepts your music tastes. But here's the thing: you can't change who you are to make someone else happy. You need to find someone who loves you for who you are, music preferences and all. Maybe this relationship isn't the right one for you, and that's okay. You deserve to be with someone who accepts you for who you are."

TITLE: My friend [20M] and I [22M] got in a fight and now he wants to talk it over. But I kind of want to stop being friends but don't want to hurt his feelings.

POST: So a little over two weeks ago, my friend got upset with me because I preordered movie tickets, you can [Read more about that here] but basically, my step dad wanted me to preorder our tickets and then tell him where they are so him and his uncle can preorder the seats beside us, he ended up telling me I was rude and such and I got pretty upset about it as well. We have been having really stupid arguments for the last few months and I'm kind of sick of it, so I figure that even though he is my only friend (he doesn't know this, but he says I'm his only friend he can really hang out with), it's best to just end things.

Now yesterday he texted me saying "Hey shelcod" and I stupidly replied back with "Hey" because I was curious as to what he would say. He ended up asking to get together to talk face to face and I told him I am unavailable until next week.

Now the thing is I have thought about it more and realize that no matter how I tell it to him, it will end up hurting his feelings and I don't want to make anyone sad. So I've come up with 3 ideas. Would it be better if I just disappeared and said nothing more to him, should I tell it to his face, or should I go and make up with him and then just casually blow off all communication?

TL;DR: My friend and I got in a fight and now he wants to talk it over. I want to stop being friends but don't want to hurt his feelings. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's better to be honest with him. You can't keep putting off the conversation and it's not fair to him. If you're not willing to work on the friendship, it's better to just be upfront about it. You can say something like 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about our friendship and I think it's time for us to go our separate ways. I appreciate the good times we had, but I think it's best for both of us to move on.'"
2. **u/sadpanda123**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's better to be honest with him. However, you could also try to have a conversation with him about what you're feeling and see if you can work through your issues. It's possible that you're both just going through a rough patch and can work through it. But if you're really not willing to put in the effort to fix the friendship, then it's better to just be upfront about it."
3. **u/itsjustme123**: "I think it's better to just disappear and say nothing more to him. You don't owe him an explanation and it's not your responsibility to make him feel better. If he's really upset, he can try to reach out to you and you can just ignore him. It's not your problem to fix."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you should try to have a conversation with him about what you're feeling. It's possible that you're both just going through a rough patch and can work through it. But if you're really not willing to put in the effort to fix the friendship, then it's better to just be upfront about it.

**Conclusion:** The majority of the comments suggest that it's better to be honest with your friend and have a conversation about your feelings. Some people suggest that you should try to work through your issues and see if you can fix the friendship, while others think that it's better to just be upfront and end the friendship. A few people suggest that you should just disappear and say nothing more to him. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but it's important to consider the potential consequences of your actions.

TITLE: I (22F) want have sex (again) with my married boss (38M).

POST: During summer he lives in my hometown and has office here and in his hometown, 100km away where he lives rest of the year. But comes in my hometown regularly.

I approached him. We were fuck buddies during summer before I went to college. No feelings. Usually sex is always better in my head, but this was different, it was damn good. He wasn't married then.

I went to college. He got married. He said that we can continue our'relationship' but during summer I travelled and worked abroad. Repeated that for 4 years. Minding my own business. We lost touch.

In June we met in our neighbourhood and he offered me a job. I was planning to go abroad again and he said that I can start when I want. This is my last year at uni, classes are easy and aren't mandatory. So I thought great, it is good job, good money and, most important, it will help me gain experience.

I work there 6 weeks. I want him to fuck me. Now I sit in office, with two other co-workers, he is in his office few meters away and I imagining how he fucks me. No comment.

He flirts a little when we are alone, nothing inappropriate, we have lunch sometimes... He said that if I want, I just have to send him text and that was it. Didn't mention it again.

I planned to work here until I finish uni and then I will move abroad for good. I have some dates, 'good' old Tinder, but nothing interesting.

Should I quit? Or just shut up and stay strong? 
Worst thing is that I can't trust myself. I am all good for 5 days, don't even thing about him and then in one second everything changes and I am sooo close to click'send'.

TL;DR: I have a job with my married boss who I used to have a casual relationship with. I want to have sex with him again, but I'm torn between quitting or staying strong.

TITLE: [18/m] My girlfriend [19/F] is a abstinent, I am not.  This is causing some problems in our relationship, and I need some advice.

POST: We've been dating a little over 2 months, and she is the sweetest, 
most perfect girl I know.  The only way I can describe her is that she is the kind of person everyone wanted to grow up to be.  She's never had sex, she's never even tasted alcohol or touched a single drug.  

This has caused a problem with our relationship, because she wont have sex with me.  At the beginning of our relationship she told me to give it six months and it will happen, however she recently told me that she wants to remain a virgin until she is married.  I don't know what to do.  I really like her but this is a problem for me. I go from not being in a relationship and having sex fairly regularly, to doing without while im in one.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is abstinent, I'm not. She wants to remain a virgin until marriage, causing problems in our relationship. What do I do?

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

* **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, if she's not willing to compromise on this issue, it may be a sign that you're not compatible in the long run. You need to think about what you're willing to sacrifice in a relationship and what you're not. If you're not willing to wait, then it may be best to end things now rather than leading her on."
* **u/relationshipgoals**: "It's great that she's making a conscious decision about her own body and sexuality. You should respect her boundaries and have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. It's possible that you can find a compromise, like setting a goal to wait until marriage or exploring other forms of intimacy that don't involve sex."
* **u/sexpositive**: "It's not fair to pressure her into having sex if she's not comfortable with it. You need to respect her boundaries and prioritize her feelings and desires. If you're not willing to wait, then it may be best to end things and find someone who is more compatible with your needs."
* **u/communicationiskey**: "You need to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and desires. Be honest with her about what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. It's possible that you can find a solution that works for both of you, but you need to be willing to listen to her perspective and respect her boundaries."

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

* Respect your girlfriend's boundaries and decisions about her own body and sexuality.
* Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and desires.
* Consider finding a compromise, such as setting a goal to wait until marriage or exploring other forms of intimacy.
* Prioritize your girlfriend's feelings and desires, and be willing to wait or end the relationship if she's not willing to compromise.
* Communicate effectively and respectfully with your girlfriend to find a solution that works for both of you.

TITLE: I am [27/f] in a relationship with a partner [31/M] who hates himself because of a disability.

POST: I am a 27/f grad student who works part time. My boyfriend, who I am technically broken up with now, is 31 and is currently unemployed but taking classes part-time. He wants to have a full time job by the end of this year. 

We both have our issues and that is putting extra stress on the relationship, but my boyfriend's constant negativity and lack of motivation has become a massive problem. My boyfriend was born with greater than 50% hearing loss in both ears and cannot hear many things without the assistance of hearing aids. He wasn't able to hear well at all until his teenage years and he received better hearing aids that helped him hear many things he could not hear before. While he has graduated from college and held jobs, he still views himself as a victim, even though he can hear well at this point in his life.

He is seriously the most self loathing person I've ever met. I have tried to encourage him but I'm losing patience. In the beginning I didn't care that my boyfriend was hearing impaired since there wasn't a communication problem at all, he can hear well with hearing aids, and he seemed to be a pretty confident and social person despite his hearing impairment. Now, I am starting to think that he was faking it for the first few months, and he's really just content to be an angry and negative human being. He gets mad every time he thinks someone is looking at his hearing aids, or asks well-meaning questions about his hearing loss. We both know it's going to happen once in a while, but every time it does he just gets mad and shuts down. 

He can be a wonderful boyfriend when he wants to be, and I still believe he is a good person with a big heart. We've decided to just be friends for the immediate future, and try again when we're both ready, but I don't know if I should just forget him completely, or support him from a distance. He has a lot of positive qualities, he is very intelligent, and he is compassionate and thoughtful. I still believe he can turn his life around, but I don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too much.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is 31/M, born with hearing loss, and has a negative outlook on life. He gets mad when people ask questions about his hearing loss or look at his hearing aids. We're taking a break, but I'm unsure if I should support him from a distance or just move on.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to add that I'm not looking for advice on how to "fix" him or make him more positive. I'm just looking for support and understanding. I know that people with disabilities face unique challenges, and I'm trying to be understanding and supportive. However, his constant negativity and self-loathing is really taking a toll on me and our relationship. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable to still care about him and want to support him, or if I should just focus on my own well-being and move on.**END EDIT**

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being incredibly understanding and supportive. It's not your job to 'fix' him, but rather to be a supportive partner. It's okay to take a break and focus on your own well-being. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're trying to understand and support him, but he's not reciprocating that effort. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take a break. You can't pour from an empty cup."
* "I think you're being very reasonable. You're not asking him to change, you're just asking him to be more positive and supportive. If he can't do that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve someone who will support and uplift you, not bring you down."
* "I think you're being too focused on his disability. It's not the disability that's the problem, it's his attitude and negativity. You can't change his attitude, but you can change how you respond to it. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being."
* "I think you're being very brave to share this story. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about the challenges you're facing in your relationship. I hope you find the support and understanding you're looking for."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all for your comments. I appreciate your understanding and support. I think I was being too hard on myself, and I need to prioritize my own well-being. I'm going to take some time to focus on myself and figure out what I want for my future. I'm not sure if I'll ever get back together with my boyfriend, but I do know that I need to take care of myself and make sure I'm happy and fulfilled. Thank you again for your support and understanding.**END ORIGINAL POSTER'S RESPONSE**

TITLE: I want to cut things off because they will end by the end of the summer, but I have no one else in town.

POST: My guy (20) and myself (20) are incompatible. We argue over small stupid things, have different personalities (introverted vs. extroverted), and I think are on two different planes of maturity.

We have been together for about 1.5 years. Met in college, he ended up dropping out by the end of the semester due to grades and family issues. We stayed together LD until the end of the spring semester. I 
ended things between us by the middle of June; I couldn't handle it.

We ended up together again this past December, still a LD situation. We made some great progress in communication and thinking of the other person in our choices and stuff. It was a very different relationship this time around, much better.

Then he told me in late March he would be not be attending the university I am currently enrolled in (like I was anxiously anticipating), but another in our hometown because it was a better situation for him. 

Fast forward to now. He was officially accepted two days ago. He says he doesn't know how to act or what to say around me anymore because things have just begun to crumble. 

Why would I want to stay with someone I know I won't be with in the fall? Why not let us both be free from the frustration?
We love each other still. I'm glad he's going to this other university; it will be a more successful environment for him. But it hurts. I have no friends where I live. My good friends all live a couple hours away, and I don't have the time or money to devote to going out to see them, as much as I'd like to.

Would it be worth it to try to stay with him? Or cut things off now?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with someone who will be leaving town in the fall. We're incompatible, and I think it's best to end things now. But I have no friends in town and am worried about being alone.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you've already made up your mind. You know it's not sustainable, and you're just trying to justify staying with him because you're scared of being alone. I would cut things off now and focus on building a life for yourself. You deserve better than to be stuck in a relationship that's only going to end in heartache."
2. **u/lonelyheart**: "I feel you. I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I ended up staying with my partner because I was scared of being alone, but it only led to more pain and regret. You're right, it's better to cut things off now and focus on yourself. You can always make new friends and find new connections. It's scary, but it's worth it."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're making a great decision. It's better to end things now and avoid the drama and heartache that will come with it. You deserve to be with someone who is committed to you and your future together. Don't settle for someone who is just going to leave you behind. You're worth more than that."
4. **u/sadbuttrue**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's tough to be in a situation where you know it's not working, but you're scared of being alone. I would suggest taking some time for yourself and focusing on your own happiness. You don't have to be in a relationship to be happy. You can find joy and fulfillment on your own. And who knows, you might meet someone new and amazing in the future."
5. **u/realistic_view**: "I think you're being a bit dramatic. It's not the end of the world if you're single for a little while. You can always make new friends and find new connections. And who knows, you might even find someone better suited for you in the long run. Don't be so quick to give up on yourself and your happiness. You deserve to be with someone who loves and respects you for who you are."

TITLE: TIFU by forgetting which CD I was listening to when my head unit died

POST: This wasn't today, this was in the summer of '95.

I was making decent money living at home and lifeguarding during the summer.  Had a car that I had saved up to install a sound system.  I got Infinity speakers, Alpine V12 amp, and a [Sony CDX-C910] head unit.  This head unit was the most expensive, therefore best (teenager, remember) thing I could buy.  It had to be professionally installed by an authorized Sony installer to not void the warranty (or some such bs).

Anyway, it is an amazing CD player, hooked up to a nice amp, powering decent speakers in a bad environment for music; I loved every bit of it.

Now for those who can't imagine it now, we used to have to go to the store to buy CDs.  I lived in a smaller town, but we had a store within about ~10 miles that i bought some of my rarer imports from.  Stuff you wouldn't find in the mall.

One day my head unit died, no display, no power.  I didn't think to try and manually remove whatever CD was in there.  I scheduled an appointment with the installer of the head unit and a few days later, took it in.  I didn't have a ride, but it was my day off, so I grabbed some CDs out of the car and went into their sound room and chilled out for a few hours reading magazines.  Yes, I said hours(!).  About 3 hours later the installer comes out and finds me.  He explained that they thought it was something simple like a blown fuse.  They found a blown fuse and replaced it, but the sound was horrible.  They troubleshot the whole unit before replacing it.  Twice.  They couldn't figure out what was going on until they swapped out the CD.  That's when he held up the CD I was listening to at the time it died, [Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God (halo nine UK import)] disc 2, and I it all hit me.

For those that have never heard it - here's the first song on that CD ([Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God](

TL;DR: I forgot which CD was in my car stereo when it died, and it took the installer 3 hours to figure out the problem.  I was listening to Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God (halo nine UK import) disc 2.  I TIFU by not checking the CD player before taking it in.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author forgot which CD was in their car stereo when it died, leading to a series of misunderstandings and a 3-hour wait at the repair shop. The post is well-written and engaging, with a clear and concise narrative that makes it easy to follow along. The use of specific details, such as the make and model of the car stereo and the CD title, adds to the post's authenticity and humor. Overall, this post is a great example of a well-crafted "TIFU" story that is both entertaining and relatable.

TITLE: [NSV][PIC] Frustration, determination and the perfect pair of pants.

POST: So, I started running.  

More specifically, I started the C25k program in hopes of becoming a *runner*.  Sometimes, it still feels like I might not make it through those last intervals of week 3.   However, after week 1, I learned how tolerable running could be if I just never looked at the timer.   *("I still have THAT much time left?  Fff.")*  Instead, I would zone out, not look at the clock and think about awesome, motivating things.

Since starting on this road, every Monday I would muster up the courage to step up to the scale and be faced with my destiny, my frustration, watching the numbers move in tiny increments or sometimes, not at all.  The numbers shouldn't have mattered so much to me, but they did.  I would get discouraged and lose focus on the fitness goals I was truly trying to achieve.   

I stopped looking at the scale, too. 

If I'd had to guess at what the scale would've said then, it wouldn't have been much different from 2 months ago...  and then my capris humbled me.  

So, I bought these awesome capris a while ago that had sadly been stretching out in the wash over time.  I loved these capris.  (When you find bottoms you like, you never let them go.)   Hoping to find another pair, I go back to the store and there they are...  one last pair tucked away in a sale rack, but the tag reads 2 sizes too small.   Perfect for "goal" clothing! 

In the modesty of my bedroom, I try on these capris to see how far I have to go to get into these babies.  I don't know which emotion was stronger, dismay or delight, when they fit slightly loosely around my giddy little self.    My happy dance quickly turned into: *"Ergh... now I have to find something else that fits me this well..."*  Which subsequently turned back into a happy dance after I realized how much easier it's going to be to find clothes that FIT now...

TL;DR: I started running, got frustrated with the scale, stopped looking at it, and then found the perfect pair of pants that fit me well, motivating me to keep going!

[Image: A photo of the author wearing the capris, with a big smile on their face, and a caption that reads: "I did it!"]



This post is an excellent example of how a person can overcome frustration and stay motivated on their weight loss journey. The author started running and initially got frustrated with the scale, but instead of giving up, they stopped looking at it and focused on their progress in other areas. The perfect pair of pants became a symbol of their progress and a motivator to continue working towards their goals. The post is relatable, inspiring, and showcases the importance of self-care and self-compassion in the journey towards a healthier lifestyle. The image accompanying the post adds a touch of humor and joy, making it a fun and uplifting read.

TITLE: I [23M] have had a crush on [21F] for 2 months without having met or seen her at all. Can it count?

POST: As title says, I've only been in contact through text (I don't know how she looks). I've known her for around 2 years, but a lot of time has passed within those 2 years without us talking. We recently began communicating more often, and related to that, I fell in love. I've been in love before, but only with girls who I've seen and talked to the "normal way". I mean love as in "I'm prepared to spend my meager student savings to fly across half of the world just to meet her for a day and hold her hand for a second" love.

If you asked me what I love/dislike about her, I would be able to list things that I don't love, but they seem irrelevant to me at this moment, and most importantly I dont want to turn this into a study of her, since I would unavoidably skew it to get the answer I want.

She knows how I feel but highly doubts that I love the "real" her in any relevant way. I have my reasons to believe that personal reasons she previously revealed to me before I confessed shapes her opinion in the matter (which is why I'm here for a second opinion). Reasons that are private and really not relevant as long as you accept the premise. Her feelings are ultimately equally irrelevant for this specific question.

My question is: Am I LIKELY loving someone that only exists in my head? In a way I guess we all love/hate people based on personal perceptions, but you get what I mean. I know she isn't a reflection of me, it's her differences that excite me the most (I think). 

I know 2 months is a drop in the ocean, and I could just wait and see if my feelings disappear as quickly as they came (previous experiences hint towards years of feeling like this before it fades).

TL;DR: I've had a crush on someone for 2 months without meeting or seeing her. I know she doubts my feelings, and I'm wondering if I'm likely loving someone that only exists in my head.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's hard to say without knowing more about your feelings and the reasons behind them. However, it's possible that your feelings are genuine, but also influenced by the fact that you've only interacted with her through text. When you finally meet her in person, you might realize that your feelings aren't as strong as you thought. But it's also possible that your feelings are real and will only grow stronger when you meet her."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "I think it's important to consider that your feelings might be influenced by the fact that you've only interacted with her through text. It's natural to idealize someone when you don't have a full picture of who they are. When you finally meet her, you might be surprised by her quirks and flaws, which could change your feelings. But it's also possible that your feelings are genuine and will only grow stronger when you meet her. I would suggest taking things slow and getting to know her better before making any big decisions."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think it's unlikely that you're truly in love with someone you've never met. Love is often based on shared experiences, common interests, and a deep emotional connection. While it's possible to develop strong feelings for someone through text, it's unlikely that you can truly know someone without meeting them in person. I would suggest taking things slow and getting to know her better before making any big decisions."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think it's beautiful that you're willing to take a chance on someone you've never met. While it's true that you might not know everything about her, it's also possible that you can develop a deep connection with her despite the distance. I would suggest being open and honest with her about your feelings and seeing where things go. Remember that love is a risk, but it's also a beautiful and rewarding experience."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP's feelings may be influenced by the fact that they've only interacted with the person through text.
* It's natural to idealize someone when you don't have a full picture of who they are.
* Love is often based on shared experiences, common interests, and a deep emotional connection.
* Taking things slow and getting to know the person better before making any big decisions is a good idea.
* Being open and honest with the person about your feelings and seeing where things go is a good approach.

TITLE: Me [18 M] trying to choose between two girls, and I need advice. [16F and 18F]

POST: I'm a senior in high school, so I'm going to preface this post by saying I'm not looking for something long-term, but I want to have a fun relationship to end the year. 

Girl 1 is 16, so she's a little young, but she's very attractive, and we share lots of interests/ have similar hobbies. I've had a bit of a crush on her for a while, but never really did anything. (dating an 8th grader as a sophomore seemed a bit weird)The thing is,though, I am friends with her older sister, so I don't know if this will end up being a problem.

Girl 2 is 18, and I was told from her best friend that she wants to hook-up with me. She's a very funny girl and also very cute but I've heard from multiple people that she's still not over her ex. She's also much more experienced sexually, which is a positive.

TL;DR: I'm torn between a 16-year-old girl who's cute and shares my interests, but is a bit young, and an 18-year-old girl who's also cute, funny, and more experienced, but has some baggage.

I know this is a lot to ask, but I'd really appreciate any advice on what to do. Should I go for the younger girl and risk the potential drama, or should I go for the older girl and deal with the potential emotional baggage?

---

This post is an example of a common issue in the r/relationships subreddit, where a user is torn between two options and is seeking advice from the community. In this case, the user is a high school senior who is trying to decide between dating a 16-year-old girl who is cute and shares his interests, or an 18-year-old girl who is also cute and funny, but has some emotional baggage.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the situation, including the pros and cons of each option. The user is seeking advice on what to do, and is open to hearing different perspectives.

The community's response to this post is likely to be mixed, with some users advising the user to pursue the 16-year-old girl because she is younger and more innocent, while others may advise the user to pursue the 18-year-old girl because she is older and more experienced. Some users may also caution the user against dating either of the girls, citing the potential risks and consequences of dating someone who is significantly younger or older than him.

Overall, this post is a good example of the types of issues that are commonly discussed in the r/relationships subreddit, and the types of advice that users may receive in response.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my group of best friends since childhood [26 M]. Our interactions have grown boring, stagnant, and apathetic. I want change, but I don't want to leave them behind.

POST: Recently, I was taking stock of what I did this summer, and the answer was...not a whole lot.

I have a group of about eight guys I grew up with and consider lifelong friends. People that have met us have said what we have is really rare, some Stand By Me shit. I love them. I was the best man in one of their weddings.

Some have moved and got married, and one in particular is going through some difficult financial times. In those cases, I can understand why I don't see and do things with them as much. It's a natural part of getting older.

Still, though, there's a group of 4-5 guys I see every single weekend. But the problem is we can never decide on doing anything. One person doesn't like clubs. Another doesn't want to spend cash in a bar. Another hates beaches. There's always fighting about what to do. There's always dissent. And it always ends in the lowest common denominator---sitting in one of our apartments drinking and watching TV.

And I've reached a breaking point. I'm single, and I really don't have any social circle outside of them. I went to college on the other side of the country, and while I have friends there that I keep in touch with, I see them once a year.

I honestly don't know what to do? I don't even know how to make friends at this point. And I don't want to abandon my friends that I love. Up until a few years ago, things were fun! But for a 26 year-old, single guy living in the city, my life has become so boring and routine that I want to scream.

Help!

TL;DR: I'm 26, single, and stuck in a rut with my group of childhood friends. We do the same things every weekend and can't decide on anything else. I want to break free and explore new experiences, but I don't want to leave them behind.

---

This post is a great example of a common problem many people face: feeling stuck in a rut with friends and wanting to make a change. The OP (original poster) is struggling to find a balance between his desire for new experiences and his loyalty to his childhood friends.

The post is well-written and provides a clear description of the situation, including the OP's feelings and concerns. The use of specific examples, such as the fights over what to do and the lack of excitement in their activities, helps to paint a vivid picture of the problem.

The OP's question is also well-articulated, and the use of rhetorical questions ("I honestly don't know what to do? I don't even know how to make friends at this point.") shows that they are genuinely seeking help and advice.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to effectively communicate a problem and seek help from others. It is likely to receive a lot of engagement and advice from the community.

TITLE: Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [23 M/F] of 3 years doing long distance - i'm loosing faith and getting suspicions.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 and a half years and recently, I've had to move away because of my job. Its only a 2 hour distance but from going from seeing each other everyday to once in a week or in this case, one in 3 weeks... its hard. He has many more girl friends than boy friends and i am completely ok with that. but recently he's been seeing more of this one friend. today he says that its a good thing because her best friend has got a bf now and therefore, she feels alone and he feels alone too so it work out for both of them to spend time together. 

I completely trust my boyfriend and he's never given me any reason to doubt him but i still can't help but feel uncomfortable. I don't know how to address this because I feel its totally unfair of me to say that he cant see her that often or that I am uncomfortable with it coz she is a good friend of his. On top of that, our communication sucks. his phone is crap so he doesnt recieve my texts half the time and he's shit at calling anyone. I don't know how to deal with this and would really appreciate some advice.

TL;DR: 3 year relationship, 2 hour distance, boyfriend has many female friends, recently seeing one friend more often, feels uncomfortable, unsure how to address it.

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're being unfair to yourself and your boyfriend. You're assuming the worst without any evidence. Maybe he's just being a good friend and helping her out. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling, but don't jump to conclusions."
* "I'm in a similar situation and I can relate. It's hard to not feel jealous or insecure when you're not physically together. But, you need to trust your boyfriend and have faith in your relationship. If you're feeling uncomfortable, talk to him about it. But, don't assume the worst without evidence."
* "I think you're overthinking this. He's just being a good friend and helping someone out. You're making a big deal out of nothing. Have a conversation with him about how you're feeling, but try not to be too possessive or controlling."
* "I'm a girl and I have many guy friends too. It's not uncommon for people to have close friendships with people of the opposite sex. Maybe you're just feeling lonely and that's why you're feeling uncomfortable. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and don't jump to conclusions."
* "I think you should try to communicate with your boyfriend more often. It sounds like you're not getting the attention you need from him. Maybe he's not aware of how you're feeling. Try to schedule regular calls or video chats and see if that helps."

This post is an example of a common issue in long-distance relationships, where one partner may feel insecure or jealous due to the distance and lack of physical intimacy. The OP is struggling to come to terms with her boyfriend's increased interaction with a female friend, and is unsure of how to address her feelings. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend, to suggesting that she may be overthinking the situation and that her boyfriend is just being a good friend. The comments also touch on the importance of communication and trust in a relationship. Overall, the post and comments highlight the challenges of maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship in the face of distance and uncertainty.  SUBREDDIT: r/relationships

TITLE: Many of my [25M] friends [~25Fs] want to cheat with me. What is going on?

POST: First, a little background information about me:

I was never that popular in primary and high school, not a loser mind you, but never super popular.

My parents are pretty religious (I'm not at all) and strict, and I went to all-boys schools. Because of this, the friends that I had were mostly guy friends, and most girls I knew I thought of as acquaintances.

After moving to the big city to attend university I made a decision to not be the weird loner in class, and began the 'fake it til you make it' thing - and I really did make it. I got myself a bunch of really nice close friends and we do lots of stuff together all the time. First time really having female friends.

Now here comes my problem:

Most of my girl friends are in, what I would call, pretty serious comitted relationships, and weirdly enough they want to cheat on their boyfriends with me!

And I'm not misunderstanding any weird signals, they are very direct:

* "My boyfriend isn't home for the weekend, do you want to come home with me tonight and have some dirty fun?"
* "I only asked you to come outside with me to make out with you, if you'd like."
* Etc.

I always turn them down - I never liked the idea of cheating and they know this. One of them even told me the next day that she respected me more now.

I find it really weird that it isn't just one fluke, but many of my friends that try this. And mind you, not the female friends that are single, only the ones in relationships.

What I'm wondering is, why do they do this? Is it some kind of weird test of my ethics?

This isn't normal is it? Am I sending some 'cheaty'-vibes?
Do I just treat it as a compliment?

TL;DR: Many of my female friends in committed relationships want to cheat with me. I always turn them down, but I'm confused as to why they do this. Is it a test of my ethics or something else?

---

**Comments:**

* "It's not a test of your ethics, it's just that they're attracted to you and want to have fun. It's not uncommon for people to have desires outside of their relationships, and it's not necessarily a reflection on you."
* "It's possible that they're bored with their relationships and are looking for something exciting and new. You're a new and exciting option for them, and they're willing to take the risk to have some fun."
* "It's also possible that they're trying to prove to themselves that they can still have a good time and be desirable outside of their relationships. You're a symbol of freedom and excitement for them, and they're drawn to that."
* "It's not about you, it's about them. They're the ones who are making the choices and taking the risks. You're just a pawn in their game."
* "It's not normal, but it's not uncommon either. People have desires and impulses, and sometimes they act on them. It's not necessarily a reflection on you or your friends, it's just a part of human nature."
* "You don't have to take it as a compliment, but you also don't have to be rude or dismissive. You can just politely decline and move on. It's not worth getting worked up over."
* "It's possible that they're trying to get a reaction out of you. They might be bored with their relationships and are looking for something to spice things up. You're a new and exciting option for them, and they're willing to take the risk to get a reaction out of you."
* "It's not about you, it's about them. They're the ones who are making the choices and taking the risks. You're just a pawn in their game. You don't have to take it personally or get worked up over it. Just politely decline and move on."

TITLE: My GF [18F] and I [17M] plan on breaking up before college. Don't know what to feel anymore.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year and will soon be starting our last semester of school together. Sometime earlier this year, we agreed the best plan of action going into college would be for us to break up, not because we were unsatisfied with the relationship but because we both accepted we needed to develop individually, we could end up geographically really far apart and other things like that. Odds tend to stack against relationships from high school going into college. 

I don't know how I feel about this anymore. It doesn't feel good though. 

I love her. I fall in love with her again and again every day and the closer we get to this agreement, the more I love her. It seems stupid to love her with the expiration date attached to the relationship, but it feels real and I can't stop. 

We've tried to talk about this quite a few times but the conversation doesn't tend to go much of anywhere because I don't know how I feel anymore. It hurts to talk about it, too. I know what its like to have to leave people close to me and it hurts knowing that know they're just images on my computer or words on my phone or photos on my desk. I don't know if I'm ready to make her a memory.

When we first talked about this we were both so certain that, despite the fact we loved each other, a breakup before college would be best. But now I'm wondering if want I really want is to try to make it work past graduation. I need help sorting out my own feelings about the relationship and thoughts about the reality of the situation.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I plan to break up before college, but the closer we get, the more I love her and I'm not sure I'm ready to let her go.

---

This post is a great example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: the struggle to navigate a difficult decision or situation in a relationship. In this case, the OP (original poster) is grappling with the decision to break up with his girlfriend before they go to college, despite their initial agreement to do so.

The OP is torn between his desire to follow through with their original plan and his growing feelings for his girlfriend. He loves her deeply and is struggling to come to terms with the idea of letting her go. He's also worried about the pain of losing her and the potential for regret if he doesn't take the opportunity to make the relationship work.

The post is a great example of the importance of self-reflection and communication in relationships. The OP is seeking help in sorting out his own feelings and thoughts about the situation, and is looking for advice on how to approach the conversation with his girlfriend.

The comments on this post are also very insightful and offer a range of perspectives on the situation. Some commenters encourage the OP to follow through with their original plan and prioritize their individual growth and development. Others suggest that the OP should take the opportunity to re-evaluate the relationship and consider whether it's worth making an effort to make it work.

Overall, this post is a great example of the types of complex and nuanced relationship issues that are often discussed on the r/relationships subreddit. It highlights the importance of communication, self-reflection, and empathy in navigating difficult decisions and situations in relationships.

TITLE: TIFU by looking like an asshole at the GreatClips

POST: Today I got a haircut. 

I was going to give the Asian lady who cut my hair a tip so I asked her to charge $4 extra on my card like I normally do at this place. Little did I know, they had changed their system to what most consider a normal tipping method where you write your tip on the receipt. 

After filling out the receipt and handing it back to her, I asked (referring to the new style of tipping), "How is that for you?" At first she didn't seem to understand so I repeated it louder, "How is that for you?" She looked at the receipt, quickly nodded and said equally loud that the tip was much "good, good!"

I was given weird stares on the way out by the other eight or so people there. I didn't realize my mistake until I closed the door. The worst part is that she gave a really good haircut and probably deserved more of a tip but I am poor.

TL;DR: I asked the hairdresser if the tip was "good, good" and she thought I was being condescending and rude. I'm now the laughing stock of GreatClips.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of how they messed up in a situation. In this case, the author accidentally came across as condescending and rude to the hairdresser at GreatClips, and now they're the laughing stock of the place. The post is relatable because we've all had moments where we've said or done something that we later regret, and it's funny because of the author's embarrassment and self-deprecation. The post also highlights the importance of being mindful of cultural differences and communication styles, as the author's mistake was likely due to a misunderstanding of the hairdresser's cultural background. Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story that is both entertaining and educational.

TITLE: x-post from AskReddit: Girlfriend of three years made out with two people over the weekend... What to do?

POST: I was told to post this here for more advice. 

[Original thread](

The title says most of it... We were partying with some friends, and about halfway through the night, one of my buddies asked me if she and I were still together. We'd been having some rough times over the last few months, so I figured they were just asking how that had turned out. I said yes, and so did she. Over the course of the evening, a few more people came and asked me the same thing.

At the end of the night, one of my good friends came to me a little sheepishly, and told me my girlfriend had gone up to him and just made out with him with no warning. A couple others told me she was "all over them," and I walked in on her making out with another kid that I didn't know so well.

When I confronted her the next day, I asked what was going on. She said she "didn't know what came over her" and that she was sorry. But I don't buy it. You don't just do that stuff if there isn't something under the surface, right?

I could really use some advice on what to do, how to deal with what's gone on, and where to go from here. She always told me that she'd dump me on the spot if she found out I was fooling around with other people, and that she thought it was completely unacceptable and there was no excuse; so I never thought I'd be dealing with this with her. I'm pretty pissed off, and a little hurt; hypocrisy has always driven me up the wall, so I'm really not sure what to do.

Thanks in advance, Reddit!

TL;DR: Girlfriend of three years made out with two people over the weekend. She says she doesn't know what came over her, but I don't believe it. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "I think you should take some time to reflect on your own feelings and actions before making any decisions. Have you been honest with yourself about your own infidelity? Have you been neglecting your girlfriend or taking her for granted? Sometimes people act out because they're unhappy or unfulfilled in their relationship. Don't assume it's just about her being a hypocrite." (u/throwaway1234567)
* "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's struggling with some deeper issues or feelings of insecurity that are causing her to act out. Don't assume the worst about her, and try to understand where she's coming from. And honestly, if you're feeling hurt and betrayed, maybe you should take some time to reflect on your own actions and how you've been treating her." (u/peacefulwarrior)
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If she's willing to cheat on you and then lie about it, what else is she capable of? You deserve better than someone who's going to hurt you like that. Don't waste your time trying to 'fix' her or 'work through' this. You deserve someone who respects and values you." (u/strongandfree)
* "I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with her about what happened. Ask her what was going on and what she was thinking. Try to understand her perspective, even if you don't agree with it. And honestly, if you're feeling hurt and betrayed, maybe you should take some time to reflect on your own actions and how you've been treating her. Remember, relationships are a two-way street." (u/calmcoolcollective)
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want from this relationship. Are you willing to work through this and try to rebuild trust? Or are you done with the relationship and ready to move on? Either way, it's okay to take some time to figure it out. Don't rush into anything or make any impulsive decisions. Take your time and think carefully about what you want." (u/thoughtfulmind)

**Reddit's advice:**

Reddit's advice is to take a step back, reflect on the situation, and consider having a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what happened. They suggest trying to understand her perspective, even if you don't agree with it, and considering whether you're willing to work through this and try to rebuild trust or if you're done with the relationship and ready to move on. Some commenters also suggest taking time to reflect on your own actions and how you've been treating your girlfriend, and considering whether you've been neglecting or taking her for granted. Overall, Reddit's advice is to approach the situation with a calm and rational mindset, and to prioritize open and honest communication.

POST: My girlfriend likes to go out quite a bit, mostly going to bars to hang out with friends or meet people there. Many of the times, I am not with her but she always comes home to me and is faithful. She told me today that she was invited out for some drinks with a guy friend of hers, but she didn't have any money to buy drinks. He said that he would buy her a few to help her out.

Here is where I chimed in. I asked, "Don't you think its a bit weird for guys to buy you drinks when you have a boyfriend.?" She doesn't seem to think so and lets guys buy her drinks at the bar all the time. She doesn't mind if strangers buy her drinks at the bar either.

I just think its a bit weird that she lets other guys buy her drinks at the bar when she clearly has a boyfriend. Is it weird for me to think this way?

TL;DR: My girlfriend lets guys buy her drinks at the bar when she has a boyfriend, and I think it's weird. Am I being too possessive or is it okay for her to do this?

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "You're not being possessive, you're being reasonable. It's not okay for her to accept drinks from other guys when she's in a committed relationship. It's not about being jealous, it's about respecting your relationship and not giving mixed signals to other guys."
2. **u/Redditor1234**: "I think it's weird too. If she's not interested in pursuing anything with these guys, then why is she accepting their drinks? It's not just about the drinks, it's about the attention and the potential for something more. You should have a conversation with her about it and see how she feels."
3. **u/Anon123456**: "I think you're being too possessive. If your girlfriend is comfortable with it and you're not, then maybe you need to reevaluate your relationship. It's not about the drinks, it's about trust and communication. If you're not comfortable with it, then you need to have a conversation with her about it."
4. **u/throwaway789012**: "I think it's a bit of both. You're not being possessive, but you're also not being unreasonable. It's okay to have boundaries in a relationship and to communicate with your partner about what makes you uncomfortable. You should have a conversation with her about it and see how she feels."
5. **u/username123**: "I think it's weird too. If she's not interested in pursuing anything with these guys, then why is she accepting their drinks? It's not just about the drinks, it's about the attention and the potential for something more. You should have a conversation with her about it and see how she feels."

**Conclusion:**

The majority of the comments agree that it's not okay for your girlfriend to accept drinks from other guys when she has a boyfriend. Many commenters suggest that you have a conversation with her about it and see how she feels. Some commenters also suggest that it's not just about the drinks, but about the attention and potential for something more. A few commenters think that you're being too possessive and that you need to reevaluate your relationship. Overall, the comments suggest that it's important to communicate with your partner about what makes you uncomfortable and to set boundaries in your relationship.

TITLE: My boyfriend (M17) constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and really messes up my (F17) self esteem.

POST: We've been dating for fourteen months. My boyfriend has always been very honest with me about everything, which is one of the things I first loved about him. If I asked him a question, he'd give an honest answer, no matter what. My problem with this started about six months ago, when he told me that he liked another girl for the first month of our relationship, and the only reason they aren't dating is because she turned him down twice. It broke my heart. But he's started being honest about things that I really don't want to know the answer to, or question I haven't asked, such as telling me how hot another girl is, or how she has an awesome chest or ass, or along the same lines. Like, I get it. They're all very attractive. He'll always send me links from porn that he finds really attractive.

But the problem lies in the fact that I have absolutely terrible self image, and with good reason. I have little to no curves, and a bit of extra chub on my stomach. I'm not fat by any means, but definitely not skinny. And every single girl he likes, or thinks is attractive, has a massive chest with a huge butt and is perfectly skinny. Think Victoria Secret model. And if they aren't curvy, they're short and cute and skinny and blonde, which is the exact opposite from me.

The real kicker came yesterday, when he decided it would be a good idea to tell me he's in love with a fictional character. I freaked out, probably a bit more than I should, but I'm just so tired of it. Once we started fighting over this, he started trying to eat his words, saying that he just meant that she's "fun to play with". He had been talking about how she's so cute and perfect and attractive with awesome cleavage for ten minutes before, which is just suppose to traslate into "fun to play with". I don't know what to do. I love him so much, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm a second choice behind all these other girls. What can I do? I'm can't feel so worthless for much longer.

TL;DR: My boyfriend constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and it's really messing with my self esteem. I have a hard time feeling confident about my body, and every girl he finds attractive is the opposite of me. I'm tired of feeling like I'm a second choice and I don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is not respecting your boundaries and is not considering how his words are affecting you. You deserve better than someone who makes you feel like you're not good enough. You're worth so much more than that."
* "I think you need to have a serious conversation with your boyfriend about how his words are affecting you. Tell him that you feel like you're not good enough because of the way he talks about other girls. And also, tell him that you don't want to hear about other girls or see links to porn. You deserve to feel confident and loved, and it sounds like your boyfriend is not providing that for you."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If your boyfriend is constantly making you feel bad about yourself, that's not a healthy relationship. You deserve someone who makes you feel good about yourself, not bad."
* "I think you should try to focus on your own self-worth and confidence. You are more than your physical appearance, and you deserve to feel good about yourself regardless of what your boyfriend says. Try to surround yourself with positive influences and focus on your strengths and accomplishments."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your boyfriend about how his words are affecting you, but also try to understand where he's coming from. Maybe he's not even realizing how his words are making you feel. Try to have an open and honest conversation and see if you can work through this together."

TITLE: My (f/23) ex-boyfriend (m/22) of 3.5 years is depressed, but I don't know if I should be there for him.

POST: Let's call my ex- boyfriend James. OK first off, I don't really know if he's really my ex, since we are pretty much in contact and he keeps saying he will come back to me when he's done growing up. 

So recently, James's father has not been well, and needed to get surgery. Living in Canada, health care is pretty much free, so hospital bills are not the problem. However, because of this illness, he will be unable to continue working for the next 3 years. James has just finished his bachelor in electrical engineering, but has no internships or related working experience. His mother who is also working, says she can't afford working alone to support their family of 5 and is pressuring him to find a job. I don't know what she exactly said to him because I wasn't there, but James last week, cried to me over the phone, saying he needs to find a job and grow up, and to do that, he wanted a break.

James, for the years I have been with him, has sort of slacked off, and would sort of treat me like shit occasionally, for which I would reprimand him. But I've always felt the need to help him however I can. It's partially my fault, that he has become the way he is, because I was the one pushing him to apply to jobs (I would make his resume and cover letters as well as apply for the jobs for him). He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them. Because of my success with finding jobs and his failure, he sometimes tells me "you're only getting hired because you're a girl". 

Anyway, he's been feeling really low on himself, but he doesn't really have anyone to support him except me, but he just wanted to be friends until he can figure things out. 

I wanted to distance myself from him so he could get the peace he wanted, but he calls me and wants my company, so I don't understand... Why he wanted a beak.

Should I keep supporting him, or do I leave him be?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend of 3.5 years is depressed, but I don't know if I should be there for him. He's been feeling low on himself, but wants to be friends until he figures things out. I feel guilty for pushing him to apply for jobs and for his lack of success. Should I keep supporting him or leave him be?

TITLE: TIFU by almost getting run over by an ambulance

POST: So like many other TIFUs this happened awhile ago. I beleive it was my freshman year of high school when it happened.

I live near my high school so I always walk to and from my house to school. It's about a 10-15 minute walk, and there happens to be a small old persons and adult only hospital on my street. 

One day after school, I was walking home as usual. I had my earphones on and was blasting my music full volume cause I like listening to music as I walk home.

I was just crossing the street on green when I finally noticed that I was the only one crossing and even the cars had stopped. Okay? I though.

Suddenly I look to my right just in time to see the ambulance coming from my street break just before it hit me. It was literally a few inches away from me. I froze for a second, but then broke out of my daze and hurried by.

I still feel so incredibly bad for that, and since then I've never had my music as loud. And I've never walked with both earphones is either..

TL;DR: I almost got run over by an ambulance because I was listening to music too loud and didn't notice it coming.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, that's crazy! I'm glad you're okay. You're lucky it didn't happen to you when you were walking with earphones in and not paying attention."
* "I've had a few close calls like that too. It's always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings, especially when walking or driving."
* "I'm glad you learned your lesson and now you're more careful. It's always better to be safe than sorry."
* "That's a good reminder to always be aware of your surroundings, especially when walking or driving. Thanks for sharing your story."
* "I'm glad you're okay. That must have been really scary. It's always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and to not be distracted by your music or anything else."
* "I've had a few close calls like that too. It's always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and to not be distracted by your music or anything else. Thanks for sharing your story." (This comment is a repeat of a previous comment)

TITLE: After nearly a year of countless applications...

POST: I finally got a job! I've never been so happy to piss in a cup before in my life. I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!

And I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit. One post was something along the lines of: (Dealing with confidence issues) "Just fake it until you make it." Another post was a very informative post on askreddit about tips for when you actually do get interviews that said that s/he added at the end of the interview, when asked if s/he had any questions said: "What can I do or say today that will give me this job tomorrow?" (I totally said this!)

TL;DR: After nearly a year of applying to countless jobs, I finally got a job! I'm thrilled to have finally found something that I'm excited about and I'm grateful for the advice I received on this subreddit.

---

This post is a great example of the power of persistence and the importance of staying positive and motivated during a long and challenging job search. The author is thrilled to have finally found a job that they are excited about, and they are grateful for the advice they received on this subreddit.

The post also highlights the importance of being proactive and taking initiative during a job search. The author didn't just sit back and wait for opportunities to come to them - they actively searched for jobs, applied to multiple positions, and even used a temp agency to try and find work. They also didn't give up, even when faced with rejection and disappointment.

The post also shows the value of learning from others and taking advice to heart. The author mentions specific posts and pieces of advice that they received on this subreddit, and how they incorporated those tips into their job search. This is a great example of how online communities can provide valuable support and guidance during times of need.

Overall, this post is a great example of the power of perseverance, positivity, and community support during a job search. It's a reminder that even when things seem tough, it's always worth keeping a positive attitude and staying proactive in your search for a new job.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my SO [28 M] of 2 years, don't know if this is all in my head or not.

POST: Basically my SO and I have been together for roughly 2 years. Our relationship is fantastic, very open and honest. But, around a week ago we were sat talking on the sofa and he took his phone out to show me a photo of his cat. While he was scrolling i noticed a photo of a scantily dressed unidentified female in his camera roll. He clicked on it and was like "wtf?" and I was just speechless. Couldn't say anything, didn't know what to say or do. 

Instantly he said that he didn't know how that got there and was really confused. He genuinely looked really upset and confused by the situation. I said maybe he accidentally saved it from some website or w/e. He said that he didn't know and couldn't remember watching or looking at porn of said image. I pretty much shut down and just couldn't say anything else for a while. Eventually he tried to talk to me and apologised for me feeling so shitty and said that it was understandable I was upset. I was very upset, but managed to hold my shit together. We had a talk about it and I pretty much said that I knew he wouldn't do anything like that to me etc.. 

And to be honest I really can't see him cheating on me and having a picture of her on his phone or anything like that. And it wouldn't bother me if it was just an image from porn. But I can't help but feel upset and uneasy about it. I have a lot of doubt in my head, and I don't know if it's unfounded. He's never given me a reason to doubt him before. And I know I probably shouldn't now. 

Am I crazy to feel hurt?

TL;DR: SO shows me a photo of a scantily dressed female on his phone, claims he doesn't know how it got there, and I'm feeling hurt and unsure if I'm being irrational.

TITLE: I have to take an online class (no other options). The professor wants to do an online meeting. I'm a commuter student, and my internet speed is worse than most of the US.

POST: I failed a math last semester, but just found out- today- that I have to take it immediately again. Summer classes start tomorrow.

I already have summer classes to take, and am going to be doing the online math class before/after those. 

The problem is an email I got:

> I would like to have an on-line meeting on Tuesday, June 14 at 8:30 p.m. using my virtual office

My other summer classes don't last that long. I'd rather not spend another 9 hours on campus after that... I live off-campus, 30min commute on a good day. 

The biggest thing is that my internet speeds are ass. Just, pure ass. It takes an hour to load a 20min youtube vid at 144p. [Speedtest.net says my internet is worse than 98% of the US.] It's a data softcap. I get 10G of the regular speeds (1mbps) a month. Once that 10 gigs of data is used, it's back to ass speeds.

However, I do get unlimited internet from 12am-5am (which sometimes starts at 10:30? or 11? sometimes 3am???).

The local library closes at 8pm.

I don't know what to do, or what to tell the professor.

TL;DR: I have to take an online class, the professor wants an online meeting, my internet is super slow, and I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Have you tried contacting the professor to explain your situation? Maybe they can accommodate your needs or find an alternative solution."
* "You could try using a VPN to mask your slow internet speeds. It might not fix the issue, but it's worth a shot."
* "Have you considered using a public library or a friend's internet to attend the meeting? It might be a temporary solution."
* "I'm a commuter student too, and I understand your struggle. Maybe you can try to negotiate with the professor to have the meeting at a different time or find an alternative way to participate."
* "You could try to record the meeting and send it to the professor, or ask if they can provide a summary of the discussion. That way, you can still participate without having to attend the meeting in real-time."
* "I'm not sure if this is an option, but have you considered asking the professor if they can provide a written summary of the meeting instead of having an online meeting? That way, you can still stay informed without having to attend the meeting."
* "I feel your pain! I've had to deal with slow internet speeds too. Have you tried contacting your internet provider to see if they can do anything to improve your speeds? Maybe they can offer a better plan or upgrade your equipment."
* "You could try using a mobile hotspot or a portable Wi-Fi router to improve your internet speeds. It might be a temporary solution, but it's worth a shot."
* "I'm not sure if this is an option, but have you considered asking the professor if they can provide a video recording of the meeting? That way, you can watch it later and still participate in the class."
* "I feel for you, man! I've been in similar situations before. Have you tried contacting the college's IT department to see if they can help you with your internet issues? Maybe they can provide a better solution or offer some advice."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the suggestions, guys! I'll definitely try contacting the professor to explain my situation and see if they can accommodate my needs. I'll also look into using a VPN and a public library to attend the meeting. And, yeah, I'll try to record the meeting and send it to the professor if that's an option.

I'll also try contacting my internet provider to see if they can do anything to improve my speeds. And, who knows, maybe I'll even try using a mobile hotspot or a portable Wi-Fi router to improve my internet speeds.

Thanks again for all the help and advice! You guys are the best!"

TITLE: TIFU by buying a safety razor.

POST: I'm the type of man that uses an electric shaver to shave and never have used a safety razor, but yesterday I saw Pawn Star Rick Harrison's single bladed safety razor at the checkout station in Walmart. It looked like a man's man razor and being the alpha male I am I bought it. I brought the safety razor to my jaw and swiped to the right it was the closest shave I've ever had in my life.

 After that I started shaving other parts of my sexy body and eventually it got the point where I shaved my beard,chest, arms,legs,ass,pubes, and yes even my balls after feeling like a new man I then hopped into the shower and admired my self in my mirror for ten minutes and then crashed.

 I woke up this morning and immediately I realized I fucked up it feels like I have sunburn and tiny paper cuts all over my skin and it fucking burns! My only guess as to what caused this complete fuckup was I didn't apply shaving cream when I was shaving or after shave is this what razor burn feels like?!

TL;DR: I bought a safety razor, used it without shaving cream, and now I have razor burn all over my body.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "TIFU by not reading the instructions"
* "You're an alpha male? More like an idiot male"
* "I think you might have misunderstood the concept of a safety razor"
* "You're a walking advertisement for the importance of shaving cream"
* "I'm not sure what's more impressive, your lack of common sense or your ability to shave your balls"
* "You know what they say, 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks'... or in your case, you can't teach a dumbass to shave properly"
* "I hope you learned your lesson and will never make the same mistake again... or at least not until you've had a few more beers"
* "I'm not sure what's more painful, the razor burn or the embarrassment of sharing this story on the internet"
* "I think you might want to consider getting a refund and sticking to your electric shaver"
* "You know what they say, 'when life gives you lemons, make lemonade'... or in your case, when life gives you razor burn, make a funny story to share on the internet"

TITLE: Reddit: I want to lose weight....but am lacking the motivation to just do it...any suggestions?

POST: I've always had a slight issue with my weight. My lowest weight was when I was 16 at 109lbs and more recently when I was 24 I weighed about 122lbs, now Im closer to 180 (and I'm 27 now). I blame this on my sheer laziness and grad school life as well as my inability to say no to candy and yummy tasting food. This **needs** to stop though because I *feel* unhealthy. 

I used to be a gymnast when I was younger, and was super flexible...with this in mind, I decided to go to a yoga class 2 weeks ago and was absolutely wrecked after it to the point where I couldnt do anything physical for a week. I have lost all my flexibility and I'm totally out of shape :( 

I want to try a weight loss/exercise program that will work and keep me motivated. I was thinking about combining Weight Watchers with P90X...but honestly I don't even think I could do half the moves in the work out video. Other than that...I am a pretty attractive girl, have a bf who loves me no matter what, and I'm in my last year of my Ph.D....I just want to be healthy and less fat.

TL;DR: I'm 27, 180lbs, and want to lose weight. I'm lacking motivation, have tried yoga and failed, and am looking for a weight loss/exercise program that will work for me. Any suggestions?

---

**REPLIES:**

1. "Hey, I totally get it. I've been there too. I think the key is to start small and set realistic goals. Instead of trying to do a whole P90X program, try starting with just 10-15 minutes of exercise a day, 3 times a week. You can even start with just walking or jogging in place while watching TV. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the intensity and duration. And don't worry if you can't do all the moves in the workout video - just do what you can and modify as needed. Also, try to focus on progress, not perfection. It's okay to have setbacks, but don't give up! You got this!"

2. "I completely understand your struggle! I've been there too. I think the key is to find an exercise routine that you enjoy, so you'll actually look forward to doing it. For me, that's dancing. I love dancing, so I try to do it at least 3 times a week. It's a great way to get some cardio in and have fun at the same time. You could try taking a dance class or following along with dance workout videos on YouTube. And don't worry if you can't do all the moves - just have fun and move your body! As for weight loss, I think the key is to focus on whole, nutritious foods and portion control. Try to cut out processed foods and sugary drinks, and focus on eating lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of fruits and veggies. You can also try tracking your progress with a food diary or using a calorie tracking app. Good luck, and remember to be kind to yourself!"

3. "Hey, I'm a big fan of the 5K training program. It's a great way to get started with running, and it's really motivating to see your progress. You can start with just 10-15 minutes of walking a day, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get more comfortable.

5. "Hey, I'm a big fan of the 7-minute workout. It's a great way to get a quick and effective workout in, and it's really motivating to see your progress.

TITLE: How do you deal with a dying friend?

POST: I made a friend back in the forth grade with duchenne muscular dystrophy more than a decade ago. Since then we have been best friends. I knew early on that he was not long for this world but there was never a given time line. I've watched him from being able to lift his hands above his head to not being able to move them at all. He's always been a good conversationalist as his mouth hasn't weakened due to his condition. Now 25 years old he struggles to sit up for more than an hour at a time. I just spoke with his mother and its beginning to sound like my friend won't make it to the end of the year.

I always pictured him dying of a quick complication or something sudden. I pains me to see him reach this state of being, not being able to do anything he loves but mentally all there to feel the pain and frustration. He has lived a pretty good life given the hand he was dealt, it just doesn't seem right for it to end in frustration.

My friend is a trooper though. He will sit through his pain in a room of his friends than to lie alone in his room sleeping it off. He had me set up his computer in his room so that his other friends would still have something to hang around on even though his confined to his bed for most of the day.

My friend and I are really close but his death has never been a subject we've discussed and I never hope to. I think we both enjoy discussing video games and televisions show more than wasting time talking about unchangeable facts. 

How have you dealt with the on coming inevitable end of a close friend?

TL;DR: My best friend from childhood has Duchenne muscular dystrophy and is slowly losing his ability to move. His condition is worsening and it seems like he won't make it to the end of the year. I'm struggling to come to terms with his impending death and how to deal with it.

* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's amazing that your friend is still mentally sharp and able to enjoy conversations despite his physical limitations. It's great that you're supporting him and making sure he's not alone. As for dealing with the impending loss, I think it's natural to feel pain and sadness. You might consider talking to a therapist or counselor to process your emotions and find ways to cope. It's also important to remember that your friend is still with you and you can still have meaningful conversations and experiences together, even if his physical abilities are limited."

TITLE: TIFU by bathing in my cats' feces.

POST: Actually happened today!

So I had surgery last week to repair a torn labrum in my shoulder. I've been mostly lounging around and was starting to feel anxious, so I decided to start cleaning up a bit.

Eventually I come up with the brilliant idea to clean my basement, where my demon feline children house their litterbox. I decided that, because I was futilely attempting to clean in the first place, I may as well wash out the litterbox beforehand.

Enter fuck up.

Now an intelligent person would have seen the limits of their powers after barely half dragging the litter box to the dumpster 

and asking a small old lady to help me dump it.

Not me though. I got this shit.

After bringing casa de feces back to the basement I realize it's still caked in its fair share if shit, piss, and other goodies. I realize that the only way to remedy this problem is by filling it to the absolute fucking top with water and scrubbing the sides with an old rag.
Keep in mind that this is in and old sink probably about chest level.

After I had scoured the box clean and was satisfied with my concentration of piss/shit water, I then realized I only had one arm to dump every thing down the drain. No problem of course, 
shouldn't be any hassle whatsoever.

I was wrong.

After carefully starting to tip Shitanic to the side I immediately lost all semblance of control or a plan. As the entire container went over in one fell swoop I quickly realized the the shallow sink was not going to hold this cascading waterfall of terror.
Before I could even think about moving, but coincidentally just slowly enough I could open my mouth, I'm hit full on in the face with an Old Faithful of my cats' Seafood sensations lunch of yore.
Ever inch of me from head to tow covered in nasty ass piss and shit water. I even got the opportunity to taste some Friskies after extended marination.

I can feel poop in my eye

TL;DR: I bathed in my cats' feces after trying to clean the litterbox and lost control, covering myself in a mixture of piss, shit, and water.

TITLE: [21/m] My girlfriend (21/f) asked for us to be good friends, with the possibility of getting back together.

POST: My girlfriend (or ex now) asked for us to take some time apart. But by time apart, she means time out of relationship. 

We met about 2 months ago and dated for around a month. This was the first relationship for both of us in several years and we were both very excited to start. However, she began feeling too much pressure. She needed time to think if she truly likes/loves me or not and she wasn't able to have that time. 

The strange thing is she wants us to be close friends. She believes that a relationship can only be strongest if two people are very good friends already before establishing the relationship. So she wants to become good friends with me first. We moved along very quickly but she still barely knows who I am and vice versa. Two months isn't exactly enough to get to know someone so deeply. She still wants to spend a lot of time with me. But she doesn't want the burden of a relationship just yet. She said that she doesn't want to be forced to like me just because we're in a relationship. She wants her boyfriend to be her best friend as well.

But the thing is, she said she wants us to be good friends before we get together again. I also made sure to point out that I'm trying to get back together with her, and she accepted that as well. We only met each other recently but we've grown extremely fond of each other. Just too much stress I guess. 

I want to know what to do. I want to know how long I wait before I try again. She didn't give me a time. These things can't be measured in a specific time frame. I really like this girl and she's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. How do I know if we can still work out?

TL;DR: Girlfriend asked for us to take a break, but wants to remain friends. She wants to get to know me better before we get back together. I'm unsure how long to wait before trying again.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should take her up on her offer to be friends for now. It's better to have a strong foundation of friendship before trying to rekindle the romance. Just make sure to respect her boundaries and don't pressure her into getting back together if she's not ready."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's also important to focus on building your own identity and interests outside of the relationship. This will help you grow as a person and make you a more attractive partner in the long run."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so eager to get back together with her. Is it because you truly care about her or because you're scared of being single? Make sure you're doing it for the right reasons."
* "I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and expectations. Let her know that you're willing to wait for her and that you value your friendship. But also make it clear that you're not going to wait forever and that you need to know if there's a future for the two of you together."
* "I think you should focus on building a strong foundation of friendship and communication with her. If you can maintain a healthy and respectful friendship, it will be easier to rekindle the romance when the time is right. Just remember to prioritize her feelings and boundaries throughout the process."

TITLE: My parents constantly check in on me (21F) when I'm on a date with my boyfriend (20M)

POST: I'm an only child with very over protective parents. I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months now and I recently started going to his house to hang out.

The first time I went there, I had a lot of fun watching movies until late with him and his parents. Late as in 2am. I forgot to check my phone till on the way back at 2:30 with 6 missed calls, 4 voicemails, and multiple texts if I was ok. I find that quite excessive. He's not my first boyfriend, nor my first serious boyfriend. I told them where I was going, so it wasn't like they should he surprised as he stays at my house till 1-2am. 

Yesterday, I went deep sea fishing with my boyfriend and family. I told my parents where and what boat I was going on to try and help out, plus the times we'd be out to sea. I texted them after I got off of the boat and posted pictures on facebook. After that, my phone dies and it was roughly 7pm on the way back to his parents house. I shower, watch a movie, and it roughly 11pm and I remember my phone had died. I plug it in and receive multiple texts if I'm OK, where I'm at, and a phone call. Then the texts start to get rude from my dad saying "Your mother told me you were shopping for her mother's day present, you better pull it together for her tomorrow whatever the hell you have been doing!". Obviously he knew what I was doing and I have already bought her something. It was just rude and was sent after I told him I was OK and at my boyfriends parents house. 

Is all of this excessive or is it just me? How do I handle this? I don't have to check in when I'm with friends...and I didn't have to with my prior boyfriend.

TL;DR: My parents constantly check in on me when I'm on a date with my boyfriend, even when I've told them where I'm going and when I'll be back. They're getting rude and it's making me feel anxious and uncomfortable. Is this normal or am I just being paranoid?

**Top comments:**

* "I would say it's a bit of both. Your parents are being overprotective, but it's also understandable that they're worried about you. Maybe try to have a calm conversation with them about how their behavior is making you feel and see if you can find a compromise that works for everyone."

TITLE: How does a guy fix the distance growing between him and a female friend?[M26]-[F22]

POST: I work with her, and she is a good friend. And I actually did grow feelings for her but won't say anything until I leave the job. The thing is, maybe I've been giving too much attention, because she doesn't go look for me anymore, or text me as much. She use to initialize the texts as much as I did. Maybe she already has a hint on how I feels? Overall how do you bring back that closeness you had with a female friend? She's fun to talk to and the thing I don't want is to become distant.Maybe it's the me withdrawing because of my feelings and I'm over analyzing.

TL;DR: I have feelings for a female friend at work, but I'm not saying anything until I leave the job. I think I might have given too much attention, and now she doesn't initiate conversations as much. How do I bring back the closeness we had?

TITLE: I'm that other dude, too.

POST: Hey there Reddit.  

So about a week and a half ago I met this super awesome girl.  We didn't really hit it off right away.  Guys were swarming all over her.  She asked for my number and we've been seeing eachother and talking on a regular basis ever since.

A few nights ago she met me at a concert and we hit it off right away.  Dancing, kissing, grinding, the works.  For the rest of that night we were holding hands, acting like we were together and it really felt "right." 
She ended up staying the night at my place.  We stared romantically into each other's eyes, kissed quite a bit, and fell asleep in each other's arms

This situation seems too good to be true, right? That's because it is.  
She went back to her hometown yesterday to apparently see her boyfriend, says her roommate.  She told me she was going to see and spend time with her family.  

I don't want to be wasting my time on a girl who could do the same thing to me, but at the same time I am really falling for her.  
How do I confront her about this (or should I even confront her about this)??
Any other advice?

TL;DR: Met a girl, we had a great night, she's been seeing her boyfriend on the side, and I'm torn about what to do.

* "I would confront her about it. You deserve to know the truth. But be prepared for her to deny it or make excuses." (56 upvotes)
* "Maybe she's just not ready to leave her boyfriend yet? Give her some space and see if she comes back to you." (23 upvotes)
* "You're not the only one who's been in this situation. I was in a similar situation with a girl who was seeing someone else. I confronted her and she ended up leaving me for him. Don't do it, trust me." (17 upvotes)
* "You're falling for her because you're invested in the idea of a relationship with her. Take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her or are you just infatuated?" (12 upvotes)

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys. I think I'm going to take a step back and re-evaluate my feelings. I don't want to be a rebound or a side piece. I deserve better than that. I'm going to take some time for myself and focus on my own happiness. Thanks again for the advice, it's been really helpful." (34 upvotes)

TITLE: I [26F] need help with dating and finding a good LTR. Tell me what to do.

POST: I've spent my life focusing on more serious endeavors and the last 4 years have been used to study for a degree, volunteer to boost my resume and so on. So most of my choices and actions were to set myself up for the future.

Now I have never had a serious relationship and don't know where to start! I've no regular hobbies to meet men, my friends are also having trouble with dating and my closest friends have also been perpetually single so they can't introduce me to anyone. 

I have very little planned for the next 3 weeks and now I'm going to let you all tell me what to do. I mean within reason. What actions should I take to meet some nice eligible men? Throw your suggestions at me!

TL;DR: 26F, never had a serious relationship, no regular hobbies to meet men, friends are also single, need help with dating and finding a good LTR.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I'd suggest trying online dating. It's a great way to meet new people with similar interests. You can also try attending events or meetups related to your hobbies or passions. Don't be discouraged if it takes some time, just be patient and keep an open mind. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and focus on getting to know people as individuals. Don't worry about finding 'the one' right away. Take things slow, have fun, and see where things go. Also, consider taking up a new hobby or joining a club to meet new people. Good luck!"
3. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "OP, I'm not sure why you're asking for advice when you're clearly not willing to put in any effort. You're expecting people to magically appear in your life, but you're not willing to put yourself out there. I'd suggest taking a class, joining a gym, or volunteering. Anything to get you out of your comfort zone and meeting new people. And for the love of all things good, stop focusing on finding 'the one' and just enjoy the process."
4. **u/lonelyheart**: "OP, I feel your pain. I've been in your shoes before. I'd suggest trying to connect with people through shared interests or passions. Join a book club, take a cooking class, or attend a concert. Just be yourself and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know someone before jumping into a relationship."
5. **u/relationshipcoach**: "OP, I think you're looking at this all wrong. Instead of focusing on finding 'the one,' focus on building meaningful connections with people. Take the time to get to know someone, learn about their interests, and see if there's a mutual connection. Don't be afraid to take things slow and don't put too much pressure on yourself. Good luck!"

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* Online dating and attending events or meetups related to hobbies or passions can be a good way to meet new people.
* Relax and focus on getting to know people as individuals, rather than putting too much pressure on finding 'the one.'
* Take up a new hobby or join a club to meet new people and get out of your comfort zone.
* Focus on building meaningful connections with people, rather than just looking for a romantic partner.
* Don't be afraid to take things slow and don't put too much pressure on yourself. Just enjoy the process and see where things go.

TITLE: So I bumped into a homeless guy and he spilled his drink... am I an asshole?

POST: I'm walking down the street in New York, and there's a steady stream of foot traffic going in either direction. Out of the corner of my eye, I'm watching people coming at me when I bump shoulders with a guy and hear a splat of what sounded like some kind of drink behind me. Recalling what I had previously seen, it looked to be an emaciated man carrying an old black plastic shopping bag that I had bumped shoulders with. Thinking nothing of it, I keep walking. Then I hear someone say "excuse me" from behind, and realize that I may have knocked the plastic bag out of the homeless-looking man's hand by mistake. Two thoughts pop into my head about what might have happened: 1) this guy is trying to scam me, and probably "accidentally" bumps into people and drops things all the time, hoping that they'll overcompensate him for what they've "damaged" 2) I genuinely knocked something out of this guy's hand. In the case of the latter scenario, my response is still going to be something like "well, you should really carry your things away from oncoming traffic if they're that important to you," but I figure this homeless guy isn't the type who's going to listen to that kind of reasoning. So I ignore him. I pick up my pace to walk quickly like someone who's in a hurry, but not quickly enough that he could accuse me of trying to evade him. Then I hear "excuse me" again. At this point I'm thinking "fuck, this guy is persistent, and he's definitely not the kind of person I want to get into an argument with on the street." I also note that I'm only one block away from the subway station, so I decide to keep my pace up and continue to ignore him. I duck into the underground pathway leading to the turnstile and I hear it again, with heightened urgency: "excuse me." So I make a dash for the turnstile, swipe my card, and jump on the first train out of there.

TL;DR: I bumped into a homeless guy and spilled his drink, then ignored him when he asked me to help. Am I an asshole?

TITLE: TIFU by not checking my junk email

POST: This happened today. If you didn't know, you need a letter of approval/visa to travel to Vietnam. This can be done easily by any one of the search results from Google. I knew that and paid for my visa well in advance. Got my confirmation email and didn't think twice about it until a couple days before my trip. 

I went back to my inbox to print out the letter, but it wasn't there. Searched. Nothing. Went through all my email accounts. Nothing. Curses. I emailed the company and tried to Skype them two days before. No replies. Panic mode. 

I went to another website that offers expedited visas and paid. My letter should've arrived with enough time for me to board. 

Nope. I emailed the company and they at least got back to me in a timely matter with bad news. Immigration had a meeting so I would get it later. Double curses. 
I did eventually get my visa and booked the next flight (on standby).

TL;DR: I didn't check my junk email and almost missed my flight to Vietnam.

MORAL: Always check your junk email, folks. You never know when it might save you from a TIFU moment.

TITLE: Not sure what to do..

POST: *I apologize for the shitty, nondescript title*

Girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now, both early 20s.  

She was in a LDR with a guy for 2 years, and cheated on him a few times with these two different guys.  She dated both of them separately for a bit, broke up, but still hung out with them afterwards.  

She maintains an awkward relationship with them, and they clearly want to hang out with her still (and are most definitely still into her).  She wants to hang out with them too.  I do not get along with these two guys, they are shady as all hell.

We have a good relationship now, but lately these guys have been popping up a lot more often and it has been causing me problems big time.  

Is this normal?  Am I being overly jealous, or is hanging out with guys you've cheated on your ex boyfriend with okay?  I also will be away from her for a few months pretty soon, and I'm worried something might happen while I'm gone.  

I'm at a loss, I don't want to lose her but I really can't handle the stress this is bringing me.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on her ex, still hangs out with the guys she cheated with, causing me stress and jealousy. Am I being unreasonable?

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not being unreasonable. It's understandable that you're feeling stressed and jealous. The fact that she's still hanging out with these guys is a red flag. You deserve better than to be in a situation where you're constantly worried about your girlfriend's past relationships."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive. Just because she cheated on her ex doesn't mean she's going to cheat on you. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings."
* "I'm not saying it's okay, but it's not uncommon for people to still hang out with their ex's friends or acquaintances. If you're really uncomfortable with the situation, maybe you should have a talk with her about it. But don't assume the worst just yet."
* "I think you're being a bit too quick to judge. Just because she's still friends with these guys doesn't mean she's going to cheat on you. Maybe she's just trying to maintain a connection with people from her past. You should try to have an open mind and talk to her about your feelings instead of jumping to conclusions."
* "Honestly, if I were in your shoes, I would be out of there. You deserve someone who is committed to you and doesn't have lingering feelings for other guys. It's not worth the stress and anxiety."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I think I was being a bit too quick to judge, and I appreciate the advice to have an open and honest conversation with my girlfriend about my feelings. I'm going to try to approach the situation with a more level head and see where it takes me. Thanks again for the input!

TITLE: TIFU by moving my paraplegic wife

POST: This happened 4 days ago actually but I was so scared in the past days that i didn't have the hand stability to write on a keyboard

My wife and i had an accident and she's on a wheelchair (she started moving her legs again but still a long way to go) so it was nighttime and she asked me if i can turn her upside down, when i am moving her suddenly the weight of her leg shifts her lower body and i hear a crack... (like when you crack your back) the first thing she says is... I can't feel my legs.. I almost fainted right there, I try to calm her but I know what that means (I am en EMT) so i do the sensible thing... its 1 am and i have to call an ambulance.

Once we arrive at the clinic she's crying because she knows what this means, i speak to the doctor and tell her the situation, the doctor says "uff" confirming my deepest fears, she has X-rays done and an MRI, we had to wait almost 2 days for the specialist to arrive but i had already seen the X-rays and saw no changes on them, after the specialist saw the MRI said there were no changes, and we could breathe.

They sent us home with anti-inflammatory medicine and our regular exercise schedule, a day later (yesterday night) she said "Baby i can feel my legs again... i was happy and today she said, I can move my legs as i used to... I could finally breathe.

(Sorry if english no good, english me not first language)

TL;DR: My paraplegic wife asked me to turn her upside down, I accidentally shifted her weight and she lost feeling in her legs. We rushed to the hospital, got an MRI, and after 2 days, the specialist said there were no changes. She started feeling her legs again and now she can move them like before.

TITLE: Is this fling fizzling?

POST: Both in our mid 20s. I have been sleeping with a girl for over a year now. We work together and when it started when she still had a boyfriend. It happened under circumstances I am not proud of.  She came to me when her relationship was fizzling out, and I think she needed me to see if there was any hope of re-igniting a flame of passion that she has not had in a while.  I was the other man for almost 6 months.  Then we decided that had to stop.  
We took a pause for a few months, but since we work together, we still constantly saw each other.  So when I find out she moved out of her shared apartment and broke up with her boyfriend, we start it up again. 

Things are great for a month, but then something happened.  I can't pinpoint it, but the passion is gone.  We both used to stare at each other with passion, and we used to make love with passion.  Over the past month, she has stopped doing anything romantic, surprising or spontaneous.  

I think I have a high sex drive, and I like to have sex everyday. For the first few months we had sex 3 times a day, but now, after about 4 months of this, we only have sex maybe 1-2 times a week.

I care about her a lot, and I was kind of hoping that it could be something more. She says she still isn't ready to get into a relationship, which I understand.  We had agreed at the start of this that we were just going to keep it to casual sex, but we both understood that we had feelings for each other. 

Not sure if I should just let her be for a while, move on or keep with it for a while longer.  Again, I felt like I was falling for this girl a few months ago, but I feel like now she is fighting it.

TL;DR: Been sleeping with a girl for over a year, we took a break, then started up again after she broke up with her boyfriend. Passion has fizzled out, sex has decreased, and I'm not sure if I should keep going or move on.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to make a relationship out of a fling. You both agreed to keep it casual, but you're expecting more. Maybe it's time to accept that this is just a physical connection and not meant to be anything more. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to build a relationship with you."
2. **u/relationship_guru**: "It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's feeling the same way and doesn't know how to express it. It's possible that you both need to re-evaluate what you want from each other and see if you're on the same page."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm going to be blunt - you're not going to get what you want from her. She's made it clear she's not ready for a relationship, and you're just going to keep getting disappointed. It's time to move on and find someone who is willing to put in the effort to build a connection with you."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think you should try to have a heart-to-heart with her and see if you can rekindle the passion. Maybe there's something going on in her life that's causing her to feel disconnected from you. If that doesn't work, then maybe it's time to accept that this is just a physical connection and move on. But don't give up on love just yet - there's someone out there who will love you for who you are."

TITLE: What was the fallout after a person you were dating dropped "I love you," and you lied when responding "I love you too."?

POST: This happened last week, after dinner and drinks, and during sex. She said it, and I fucked up and responded in kind. Told her the truth tonight, and she stormed out. It's over. 

I feel horrible, but she did drop that on me right in the middle of a drunken melee. I should feel honored and lucky that someone feels that way about me.
 
We dated a couple of months last year and had only recently started dating again, and this happens. Tonight I acted like she didn't say it, and when pressed, I told her the truth. 

I only hope I haven't fucked her up too bad. She doesn't deserve it. 

I'll start another thread about why I'm so wishy-washy, but here's this: Has anyone else experienced this? How'd it work out?

TL;DR: Dropped "I love you" during sex, lied and said "I love you too." Told the truth tonight, and she's gone. Feeling horrible.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're lucky she didn't punch you. You should've just said 'I care about you deeply' or something instead of lying. Now you've lost a good person."

TITLE: TIFU by being an Insensitive Jerk

POST: So like many others, this happened last year but I am still mortified as our office just recently had a congratulatory card recently that reminded me of the tragedy. 

I work in a corporate office building, and many times theres a designated person that walks around getting all the employees to sign a happy birthday, get well, congratulations card. 
One day I was extremely busy with audits, reports, reviews, and the girl designated for this card signing approaches me. As I am multi-tasking, she in her ninja ways sneaked up and whispered, "hey sign this". without any saying anything else. I didnt take a very good look at the card, and opened it up, and didnt really read or even glance what other peoples comments are and what they wrote, the girl asking me to sign the card didnt say what its for. 
I signed Happy Birthday! Enjoy - My name, gave it back and went about my work.

15 minutes pass by and I get a minute to breathe, I overheard one of my staff members talk to another, saying, its so sad.. I hope they are doing ok... it was then that I noticed I fucked up. I immediately got up and asked them what they are talking about.. and they told me so and so's mother passed away. 

It hit me... I just wrote happy birthday on a condolences card... 

I told a few specific people in the office hoping they would relay my apologies to the person I decimated with my insensitivity, but I never worked up the courage to apologize to that person face to face. No one has said anything since, but I am sure they hate me deep down.

TL;DR: I signed a condolences card "Happy Birthday" without reading the contents and now I'm mortified.

---

This post is a great example of how a simple mistake can have a significant impact on someone's life. The OP (original poster) was so caught up in their own work that they didn't take the time to read the card or ask what it was for, leading to a devastating mistake. The fact that they didn't even have the courage to apologize to the person directly is a testament to how much they regret their actions.

The post also highlights the importance of being mindful of the people around us and taking the time to show empathy and compassion. It's a reminder that even small actions can have a big impact, and that we should always strive to be kind and considerate in our interactions with others.

The comments on this post are also worth reading, as they offer a range of perspectives and advice on how to handle similar situations in the future. Some people offer words of encouragement and support, while others share their own stories of similar mistakes and how they learned from them. Overall, this post is a great reminder of the importance of being mindful and compassionate in our daily interactions.

TITLE: A bill paying trick that helps me track and lower monthly expenses.

POST: This may be obvious to some, but it has helped me get a much better picture of my finances. For years I struggled with paying bills, sometimes because of low income but just as often because I was disorganized. After making simple changes to my bank account structures I don't miss bills, have lowered my spending and can understand my expenses better.

The trick is pretty simple. Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses. Then go about setting them all on auto-pay. Most of the time you can connect the bank numbers or use a debit card to automate payment. If you need to pay an individual or have to pay by check most banks have a bill pay feature that will send scheduled payments by check.

At first you'll need to overpay into this account because your expenses estimate might be off and you need a buffered balance. After a couple of months you'll be able to pay in almost exactly what you need. Then you can setup automatic deposit to cover all your expenses.

Congratulations, your financial life is now completely automated. Did you remember to pay such and such bill? Yeah totally. Analyzing your accounts it looks like you're paying for a lot of online storage. Google sells space cheap. Consolidate accounts and save. Get hit with an unexpected bill? There's plenty of buffer in the account, just pay a bit more in to make up and move on.

It can take a while to move all your accounts over, but once you do the benefits of organization are massive. Also, once you make that one or two payments into the account per month (pay into it right when you get income) whatever remains is your spending / saving money.

TL;DR: Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses, set them on auto-pay, and use the buffer to track and lower your monthly expenses.

COMMENTS:

* "This is a great idea! I've been struggling with paying bills on time and this has helped me stay on track. Thanks for sharing!"
* "I've been doing something similar, but I use a spreadsheet to track my expenses. This is a great alternative for those who aren't as tech-savvy."
* "I've been using a budgeting app to track my expenses, but this is a great way to automate the process. Thanks for sharing!"
* "I've been struggling with overspending and this has helped me stay on track. I've been able to cut back on unnecessary expenses and save more money."
* "This is a great way to take control of your finances. It's easy to set up and maintain, and it's a great way to track your expenses and stay on top of your bills."

This post is a great example of how a simple trick can make a big difference in someone's financial life. The author shares a practical tip that has helped them stay on top of their expenses and reduce their spending. The comments are also very supportive and offer additional suggestions and ideas for managing finances. The post is well-written and easy to follow, making it a great resource for anyone looking to improve their financial situation.

TITLE: I [20 M] am confused about my feelings towards my best-friend of almost a year [24 F]

POST: I met my current best friend online almost a year ago and we just got along instantly. We shared personal thoughts and feelings and got to the point where we talk every day, usually multiple times. We'll watch TV shows together on Netflix, play video games together or just talk when we're bored. We live a couple hours away (by car) but have spent two weekends together in person and both had a great time. When I met her, she was in a long term relationship and I was totally happy with just being her friend. She's recently single and I have been struggling with trying to figure out if I just love her like a best friend or if I'm in love with her. 

I've dated a couple girls in the past but have never connected with one like I have her. I'm just afraid of regretting losing this opportunity to see if we want to be more than just friends. At the same time, I'm afraid of "What if things didn't work out?". I wouldn't want a failed relationship to ruin our friendship. While her last relationship of many years was a very long distance relationship (different country), I don't think she'd want to jump into another one even if I only live a couple hours away. When she was going through her break-up, which she is still slightly struggling with, I remained completely neutral and was very supportive of her to choose whatever option that makes her happy. I love her and all I want is for her to be happy. But now, I find myself being sad at random times over the confusion about my feelings. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do so I don't regret my choice in the future? I could tell her how I feel, I'm not really afraid of whether or not she feels the same but more afraid of how her not feeling the same way would affect our friendship. I know she uses Reddit just about as much as me, and she would totally know this is about her if she read it, so I'm going to just hope that doesn't happen. I didn't really know where else to go to ask for help.

TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old guy who has been best friends with a 24-year-old woman for almost a year. We've grown close and I'm struggling to figure out if I'm in love with her or just value her as a best friend. I'm afraid of ruining our friendship if things don't work out romantically. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do? 

**Comments:**

TITLE: Found postage, who wants mail?

POST: So yesterday I went to the post office to mail out some packages. I used the APC (Automated Postal Center) like I always do [saves time dealing with the lines]. I purchased some shipping labels and went to grab them below. At first I thought the machine had printed the first label wrong, but then realized it was an extra. Someone had mistakenly left it - I guess they didn't understand how the machine worked. So now I have an extra label/stamp for the city of Syosset, NY (11773). I'd be happy to send a random letter/postcard to anyone in this area. I hate seeing things go to waste. Feel free to P.M. if you'd like. Thanks.

TL;DR: Found an extra postage label at the post office, willing to send a letter/postcard to someone in Syosset, NY (11773). PM me if interested.

TITLE: TIFU by writing a fake TIFU

POST: So, I thought I'd see how easy it could be to write a fake and yet relatively believable TIFU.

About an hour and a half ago I had finished my masterpiece, ready to deceive all of you. This fake story involved me having sexual intercourse with two of my cousins a couple of years ago and some supposed pictures I'd taken on a disposable camera which i'd kept. The fake story went on, detailing how while I was away my mother decided to develop the pictures on said fake camera, as in this made up world we'd recently lost some family photos and she had hoped there would be some on there. In this fake story of course she went mad once eyed been developed and she's seen the non existent photos. 

So now you know about the fake story, I can go back to when I'd just finished writing it - happy with my work, I went downstairs and decided to take the dog for a walk, i was about 35 minutes. I get back, my computer was off - all cords unplugged, everyone out of the house, phone off the hook. Clearly, one, or all of my parents have read this and phoned someone or something. Sorry this is terribly written I'm writing this from my phone and not in the most coherent state right now. How the fuck do I explain this one..

TL;DR: I wrote a fake TIFU, but now I'm worried my parents might have read it and are freaking out.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author is sharing a humorous and relatable tale of how they messed up in some way. In this case, the author wrote a fake TIFU story, but then realized that their parents might have read it and are now upset.

The post is written in a casual and conversational tone, with the author using colloquial language and slang (e.g. "TIFU", "freaking out"). The story is also quite relatable, as many people can imagine themselves in a similar situation where they've done something silly or embarrassing and then had to deal with the consequences.

The post also has a good balance of humor and seriousness, as the author is clearly trying to be funny and lighthearted, but also acknowledges that the situation is a bit serious and worrying. The use of emojis and the author's apologetic tone ("Sorry this is terribly written...") also add to the post's humor and relatability.

Overall, this post is a great example of a well-written and engaging "TIFU" story that is both funny and relatable.

TITLE: Is stashing a bag of dirt in my sister's luggage a bad idea?

POST: My sister and I have a game that's been going on for the last decade or so where we hide a bag of dirt among each others possessions.  She's going travelling in the fall and I wanted to hide it in her luggage so she'd have to cart it around for the two and a half months she's planning on going for.  I was wondering about possible implications with customs, other than a few odd looks.  She's going to Australia and the Philippines for sure as well as a couple other countries in southeast asia and I assume she'll pass through the US.  Would she get any grief about bringing in foreign contaminants or whatever?  I realize she could just throw the bag out if need be, but I don't really want that to happen.  It's a small ziplock bag of very dry soil with a bit of mulch in it, probably less than 25 grams total (<1 ounce).

TL;DR: I'm planning on hiding a small bag of dirt in my sister's luggage for a game we've been playing for years.  She's going to Australia, the Philippines, and a few other countries in southeast asia.  Are there any potential issues with customs or anything else I should be worried about?

---

REPLIES:

* "I think it's a bad idea. Not only could you get in trouble with customs, but also think about the poor person who has to clean up after your sister when she discovers the dirt in her luggage. Just leave it alone, it's not worth the risk."
* "I think it's a fun game, but you're right to be concerned about customs. I'd suggest weighing the pros and cons and deciding if it's really worth it. If you do decide to go through with it, make sure your sister knows what's going on so she's prepared for any questions or issues that might arise."
* "I think it's a great idea! It's a fun game and it's not like it's going to cause any harm. Just make sure your sister knows what's going on and is okay with it. And if she does get in trouble with customs, it's not like it's going to be a big deal. It's just a little bag of dirt!"

TITLE: Boyfriend (24M) thinks I (18F) should be 'better' than him? What..?

POST: A little about both of us:

Together for 6 months. Its been a great learning experience for both of us and we come from similar backgrounds with a lot in common, however

I tend to push him in areas where he lacks like school and work. He appreciates it and says he wouldn't be where he was without me, however, he nags me CONSTANTLY about going to the gym (I go twice a day), my eating habits(vegan), sleeping habits, and grades. His are admittedly much worse than mine.

When I tell him "I like you the way you are and I want you to want to improve yourself first. I don't feel like I have the authority to tell you those things"' he tells me he holds me to a higher standard than himself.

I've encouraged him to come on runs with me (he's lucky enough to be in great shape, but who doesn't want to look and feel better) buy him protein drinks to bulk up ( he says he wants to), left him alone to study, make goals for the future to work harder, encouraged him to hang out with friends, etc, and he sits in the house all day and brushes it off.

What do I do if I finish college before him (which is likely) or bypass him in any areas of life later down the road? How do I make him want to be better before I think I'm too good for him and leave? Is this even normal?

TL;DR: Boyfriend (24M) constantly nags me (18F) about self-improvement, but doesn't take his own advice. I feel like he's holding me to a higher standard than himself. What do I do?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "Honestly, it sounds like he's using you as a crutch to improve himself, but not actually taking initiative to do so himself. You deserve someone who wants to improve themselves for their own sake, not just because you're pushing them to."
2. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're 18, and it's normal to have different goals and priorities than your partner. If he's not willing to work on himself, that's not your problem. You can't force someone to change."
3. "It's not about being 'better' than him, it's about being happy and fulfilled. If you're not happy with your own life, it's not his responsibility to fix it. You need to focus on your own goals and priorities, and if he's not on the same page, that's okay."
4. "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how his constant nagging is making you feel. Tell him that you appreciate his enthusiasm, but you need him to focus on his own goals and priorities, rather than trying to improve you."
5. "You're 18, and he's 24. You're at different stages of your life, and it's normal to have different priorities. If he's not willing to work on himself, that's not your problem. You need to focus on your own goals and priorities, and if he's not on the same page, that's okay."

**Community feedback:**

The community is generally in agreement that the boyfriend's behavior is not healthy or respectful. Many commenters suggest that the OP (original poster) should focus on her own goals and priorities, and not try to change her boyfriend or hold him to a higher standard. Others suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about how his behavior is making her feel. Overall, the community is supportive of the OP and encourages her to prioritize her own happiness and fulfillment.

TITLE: My [17 M] new girlfriend's [16 F] parents won't let us see each other

POST: So me and this girl began seeing each other about a month ago, and have gotten quite serious quite fast and we are completely head over heels for each other.

The problem here is that we never get to see each other due to how overprotective of her parents are, she is literally never allowed outside the house. At first this wasn't too much of an issue, we'd skype everyday, she'd see me for 10/15 minutes after school at my bus stop (even this was limited as my friends would be there). Recently though, her parents have found out about me, and deemed that I am too much of a distraction from her studies, and that she is no longer allowed to see me or even Skype me.

We're now questioning where this relationship is going, and if there is anything we can do, because we're both so desperate at this moment in time. Unfortunately at this point she doesn't seem to be willing to lie to her parents so that's out of the question at the moment.

TL;DR: My girlfriend's parents won't let us see each other, we're desperate to find a solution.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Have you considered talking to her parents about this? Maybe there's a misunderstanding that can be cleared up.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: I would advise against lying to her parents. That's not a healthy or sustainable solution. Instead, try to have an open and honest conversation with them about your relationship and how it's affecting you both.
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: How old are you both? 16 and 17 is a big age gap, and it's understandable that her parents might be concerned about the relationship.
4. **u/teenagerproblems**: I feel you, bro. My parents were super strict when I was in high school too. Have you tried talking to her about maybe sneaking around or something?
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: I think you both need to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If her parents are this opposed to you, it might be a sign that the relationship isn't meant to be.
6. **u/parentingadvice**: As a parent myself, I can understand why you're concerned. But maybe try to have a conversation with her parents about your relationship and how it's affecting you both. It's possible they're just worried about her well-being.
7. **u/teenromance**: I'm 17 and my girlfriend is 16 too, and we're dealing with similar issues. We're trying to find a way to make it work, but it's tough. I feel you, bro.
8. **u/relationshipexpert**: I would suggest that you both take some time to think about what you want from this relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. It's possible that there's a middle ground that can be found.

TITLE: I [M/18] am fed up with one of my friends'[M/19] behaviour. Am I thinking to much about this?

POST: So, I have been friends with this guy since 6th grade. Because he lives 14km away and went to a different school than I we only talk online in voice chat room and meet IRL sometimes at a party or go for a movie night with some othe guys. But since we both finished school this year and there is a 3-4 month period of nothing to do between end of school and university starting, we have been hanging out online every day. He is rather slow and relaxed, but gets pissed really quick if something is not to his liking, which, while playing online games, happens quite often.

 Now most of the time I am not the target of this, but when he sees me as the cause of his anger and lashes out towards me, I react and it ends with us shouting and one of us leaving. This happend about 4 times in 7years but when it does, he goes into his sulking phase where he activly avoids me and then after a week or so, when I want to talk to him, tells me that he needed "time away from me". And when he goes into his sulking phase I just know that this is the phrase I am going to hear sooner or later. The cause of our anger are seldom big matters, for example I joined a rival clan of his because they asked me to be a member while his clan rejected me although I know their leader IRL. Trivial, right? Or I denied knowing two close friends of his in front of a group of new people I met, because they made neo-nazi statements.
The current event was about him thinking of me as urging him to hurry up after he made some friends and myself needlessly wait on him and me calling him out on that.

So, r/relationship_advice. Are these just normal clashes among friends? Am I thinking to much into it? Should I change my behaviour? As someone who doesnt become friends with someone easily and values his friendships above all, this is an important matter to me.

TL;DR: I'm fed up with my friend's behavior. He gets angry easily, lashes out at me, and then sulks for a week. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this or if I should change my behavior.

---

The post is asking for advice on whether the OP's concerns about his friend's behavior are normal or if he's overthinking it. The OP is frustrated with his friend's tendency to get angry easily, lash out at him, and then sulk for a week. He's wondering if he should change his behavior or if this is just a normal part of the friendship.

The comments on the post are mixed, with some people advising the OP to take a step back and reevaluate the friendship, while others suggest that the OP is overthinking things and that the friend's behavior is just a normal part of the friendship.

Some common themes in the comments include:

* The importance of communication and setting boundaries in the friendship
* The need for the OP to prioritize his own emotional well-being and not internalize his friend's behavior
* The possibility that the friend's behavior is a reflection of his own insecurities and issues, rather than the OP's behavior
* The importance of considering the context of the friendship and the fact that the OP and his friend have been friends for a long time

Overall, the comments on the post suggest that the OP's concerns are valid and that he should take a closer look at the dynamics of the friendship and consider whether it's healthy for him to continue. However, they also caution against jumping to conclusions and suggest that the OP should try to communicate with his friend and work through their issues before making any major decisions.

TITLE: 17/m I'm the other guy, need help.

POST: Hi, I am a 17 year old guy in junior year of highschool, and the other day I might have done something not all that great. I have this friend named (lets call her Patrice) who has this really shitty boyfriend(lets call him Doug) who has forced her to do some really terrible things, for instance he forced her to suck his dick, and when she asked to stop, he told her to shut up and consistently sends dick pics to other girls. To further add details on this, she's extremely dependant on him and fears to be alone which is why she hasn't ended up breaking up with her. So, anyways, my friends have been trying to hook me up with her because they want her to stop dating him, I didn't really know much about her except for that she is really fucking hot, so of course I agreed. I invited a bunch of friends over to my house to have a party. Most of them didn't end up coming, but Patrice did. We were chatting it up, until I made the grave mistake of asking her to make out (don't judge me i'm an idiot).  She was hesitant, but looked at her friend for confirmation. She, the friend, said its fine, which then led up to Patrice saying don't tell Doug (I don't really know the name suits him), so we made out. Afterwards, she felt really guilty because she still thought that she still loved him even with all the things he has done. My friends still want me to go out with her, but I don't really know how to approach it. Any advice would be great.

TL;DR: I made out with my friend Patrice who's in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend Doug. My friends want me to date her to get her away from him, but I don't know how to approach it.

---

This post is a great example of how not to handle a situation involving an abusive partner. The OP (original poster) is aware that Patrice is in an abusive relationship, but he still went ahead and made out with her, which could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerability. He also doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation and is more concerned about his own feelings and actions.

The post has received a lot of negative feedback from the community, with many users calling out the OP for his lack of empathy and understanding. Some users have also pointed out that the OP's actions could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation, and that he should be focusing on supporting Patrice rather than trying to date her.

The post has also sparked a lot of discussion about the topic of abusive relationships and how to support those who are in them. Many users have shared their own experiences and advice on how to help someone who is in an abusive relationship, and how to avoid enabling the abuser.

Overall, this post is a great example of how not to handle a situation involving an abusive partner, and how important it is to prioritize the well-being and safety of those who are in these situations.

TITLE: Am I (19f) selfish for being worried about my boyfriend's (18m) sudden lack of concern about school?

POST: We've been dating for a little over a year, and recently he started to smoke weed again (he stopped at the beginning of our relationship because I had a problem with it, but now I don't mind, it's up to him, ya know?), and since then he's started to really care less about school. He hasn't gone to a single class in over a month, he sits around smoking and playing video games. I'm afraid for him, he had kind of a rough fall semester, and if he doesn't maintain a certain GPA he gets kicked out completely of the college. I really don't want to see him mess up like this, but the few times I've tried to bring it up, he tells me not to worry, he can make his own decisions, he'll be fine, etc. Of course I'm genuinely worried for *him*, and what his life will be like if he does flunk out but I'm also worried for personal reasons. Whenever he gets stressed, he tends to be kind of a jerk to me for a while. I get ignored, lashed out at, he doesn't want to be around me, and things like that which is one of the reasons I'm worried - no one likes being a target. I'm also worried because if he flunks out, he'll have to return home and that would effect our relationship. We've had disagreements about other things and he's told me that I tend to be really selfish in our relationship (even when I don't think I am), but am I selfish for being concerned about his school because of how it would affect us? Is there anything I can try to do to make him get his stuff together?

TL;DR: Boyfriend (18m) stopped caring about school after starting to smoke weed again, I'm worried about his future and our relationship, he tells me not to worry and that he can make his own decisions, but I'm worried about the impact on our relationship and his life.

**Top comments:**

* "You're not selfish for being concerned about his school and its impact on your relationship. You're being a supportive partner and trying to help him make good decisions. It's not selfish to care about the person you're in a relationship with and want to see them succeed." (123 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a great partner by being concerned about his well-being and the potential consequences of his actions. It's not selfish to want to help him get his life back on track. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns, and see if you can find a way to support him in getting back on track." (92 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on how this affects you and your relationship. You need to remember that your boyfriend is an adult and can make his own decisions. If he's not taking school seriously, that's his problem, not yours. You can't force him to care about school, but you can support him in getting help if he wants it." (45 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit too controlling. You're trying to dictate what your boyfriend should do with his life, and that's not healthy. You need to trust him to make his own decisions and support him, even if you don't agree with them. Maybe try having a conversation with him about your concerns, but don't try to dictate what he should do." (23 upvotes)

**Overall sentiment:** The majority of commenters are supportive of the OP's concerns and think she's being a responsible and caring partner. Many suggest having an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her concerns and offering support to help him get back on track. A smaller number of commenters think the OP is being too controlling or focused on how this affects her and their relationship.

TITLE: Past issues I thought I had come to terms with came back to the surface and I wasn't prepared.  27M 20F

POST: About 10 months ago my GF(20F) of 1 year told me(27M) about her past as an escort.  It was completely against her will and started as just rapes organized by her at the time BF.   I thought I had dealt with this.  Literally didn't think about it for months now.  

Then we were watching Drive and she started acting funny when the shoot out started and as he's holding the girl down on the motel bed.  She was reacting to the gun violence, but it triggered my mind.  And it all came flooding back.  To be clear I'm not upset with her.  Never blamed her, still don't.  Her life was hell and when you have no support bad stuff happens easily.

However I can't stop thinking about wanting to bring harm to her ex.  I've caught myself looking for him as I drive to work (he works down the street) again.  Literally feeling sick today that this guy is out there walking around enjoying life like nothing happened.  Also upset with myself that I am this obsessed with wanting to crush someone's world when I've never even met him.

I love this girl to death, she means everything to me.  She's off her meds now and dealing with it herself so she's not as willing to talk about it at the moment.  So I feel completely stuck.  I've dealt with it before but I had her help.

Anyone have any advice?  We move 1.5 hours from home into an apartment together in 4 days so at least driving by the motels she used to be taken to is not going to be an issue anymore.  But that guy is still just down the street.  I know the obvious "talk to her" and will be, but right now I'm so stressed with Moving, work, getting my car fixed, etc to really have a proper conversation.

TL;DR: GF told me about her past as an escort, I thought I dealt with it, but it came back to the surface after watching a movie and now I'm consumed by wanting to harm her ex.  I love her, but I'm stuck and don't know how to deal with these feelings.

This post is a great example of how trauma can resurface and cause new emotional distress, even if the individual thought they had come to terms with the issue. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge towards his girlfriend's abuser, which is understandable given the circumstances. However, he is also aware that these feelings are not productive and are causing him distress.

The OP is seeking advice on how to deal with these feelings and is looking for ways to manage his emotions and move forward. He is aware that talking to his girlfriend is important, but he is also overwhelmed with other responsibilities and is not sure how to have a proper conversation about this issue.

The post is a great example of how trauma can affect relationships and how important it is to have open and honest communication about difficult topics. It also highlights the importance of seeking support and resources to help manage the emotional impact of trauma.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband[40M] and parents [60sF/M], married 10 years, Thanksgiving plans crisis

POST: My husband and I have been married 10 years and have two kids under 6. We live about 90 minutes from my parents. I'm not super-close with them but generally have a good relationship. 

For the last few years, we've hosted my parents and sister for Thanksgiving. We enjoy cooking and hosting, and honestly it's easier and more comfortable for the kids. We were going to do the same this year. 

But this year, plans are suddenly up in the air because:

* My mom just got out of  the hospital for something fairly serious, and is a little iffy on making the drive.

* My sister moved out-of-state over the summer and is driving back on Thanksgiving, but won't make it to their place until around 5 in the evening. My house is even further.

So my parents would like to host this year, both to save them the drive and so Sis can be at the dinner more easily. My husband says dinner can be at their house but he wants to make the turkey. I told my parents this and they basically think it's a lot of trouble. I also think it's a lot of trouble and borderline rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband was pissy when I told him this. My suggestion he talk to them and work it out did not go over well. (Possibly because I was pissy about him being pissy by that point.)

So, what should I tell my parents to avoid this turning into a huge fight where everybody feels insulted? I honestly don't care who makes the stupid turkey as long as I get to eat some.

TL;DR: My parents want to host Thanksgiving this year, but my husband wants to make the turkey. I think it's a lot of trouble and rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband is being pissy about it. What should I tell my parents to avoid a fight?

**Top Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not about who makes the turkey, it's about respecting your parents' wishes and accommodating their needs. If they want to host, let them. You can always make a side dish or bring a dessert. It's not about you, it's about them." (1,200 upvotes)
* "I think you're being too sensitive about this. It's just a meal, not a life-or-death situation. If your parents want to host, let them. If your husband wants to make the turkey, let him. It's not worth fighting about." (800 upvotes)
* "I think you should have a conversation with your parents and explain the situation. You can say something like, 'Hey Mom and Dad, we understand you want to host this year, but we were really looking forward to hosting again. Would it be okay if we compromise and make it a potluck? We can bring some dishes and you can bring others.' That way, everyone gets to contribute and it's not just one person making the main dish." (500 upvotes)
* "I think you're being too focused on the turkey. What about the kids? They might be excited to spend the holiday with their grandparents. Maybe you can find a way to make it work and still have a fun family day together." (400 upvotes)

**Other comments:**

* "I think you should just tell your parents that you're not comfortable hosting this year and that you need a break. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take a step back sometimes."
* "I think you should just make the turkey and be done with it. It's not worth the drama and stress."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your husband and explain how you're feeling. Maybe he's not aware of how much stress this is causing you and you can work together to find a solution."
* "I think you should just let your parents host and enjoy the day with your family. It's not worth fighting about."

TITLE: I [18/M] have made mistakes making my intentions clear to [18/F] and I may have made it unnecessarily complicated

POST: I have known this girl for about a year, and I am certain I like her and I am almost certain she likes me. She has done all kinds of things convince me she likes me. 

We had food together (just the two of us) a few weeks ago, she got tinder the moment I mentioned it in a conversation, and she kissed me on the neck and cheek at a party the other week. There seems to have been some attempts to make me jealous. My friends mentioned her and another friend was about to go into a relationship when that clearly wasn't the case, they were both clearly not really into it. When I was mentioned in a similar context she almost died of embarrassment (she hid under her arms for a few minutes and went bright pink). We have also told each other very deep and painful parts of our lives, and she has been very good with me about it and said she would always be there for me.

However, I think I have not been responding in the right way. When she kissed me I was tipsy and quite shocked so I didn't kiss her back like I really wanted to. I also told her I didn't want a GF a few months ago, when I did but thought that she was too high up socially, and later on she said she didn't want a BF for very similar reasons to me. I also got interrupted today so I didn't get a chance to ask her out like I wanted to. She seems to have been quite down in the dumps this week, and I have only talked to her twice. She told me some sad things about her and I wanted to hug her so badly, but If I had I think I would have been laughed at by others.

I really haven't got any idea of what to do, and I don't see her again until Monday at least. I don't want to ask her out by text since that is really impersonal. Ideas?

TL;DR: I like a girl, I think she likes me, but I've made mistakes making my intentions clear and I'm not sure what to do.

TITLE: Am I [18F] overreacting about my boyfriend's [20M] relationship with his past fling?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while, but had a breakup in January after he started his first semester at a new school. During the time we were broken up, he had a fling with a girl over a period of close to two months. He would spend the night at her apartment frequently but as far as I know, it didn't progress past making out and some groping. She admitted she had feelings for him, and he ended the physical part of their relationship because he didn't feel the same way. We got back together in late June.

My issue here is that they are still best friends, and he hangs out with her, or her and her roommates (who are also his friends), nearly every day. I'm not a jealous person when it comes to his other female friends, but because of him being back in the place where our relationship ended and his physical involvement with this other girl began, I can't stop feeling horrible. I trust him, and I love him, but I don't know her well enough to trust her. His opinion is that I need to just "get over it," but that's been really difficult. I asked him if he could potentially cut down on the time he spends with her to two to five days a week instead of every day, which he felt was an "unreasonable request."

I know I'm being jealous, but the amount of time he spends with this girl is really bothering me, and the way it's causing me to feel is putting our relationship in danger. Help?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I got back together after a breakup, but he's still close with his past fling. I'm feeling jealous and insecure, and he thinks I need to "get over it." I'm worried about the impact on our relationship.

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're not over the breakup yet. You're still holding onto a lot of emotions from that time, and it's affecting your current relationship. I'm not saying you're wrong to feel this way, but maybe take some time to reflect on why you're feeling so insecure. Is it because you're worried about losing him or because you're still processing your own emotions from the breakup?"
* "I think you're being reasonable to want some boundaries. It's not about being jealous, it's about feeling secure in your relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Maybe there's a compromise you can find that works for both of you."
* "I'm a bit surprised he's not more understanding of your feelings. It sounds like he's not taking your concerns seriously. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you. You deserve to feel secure and respected in your relationship."
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. It's not like he's still sleeping with her or anything. They're just friends. Maybe try to focus on building your own relationships and interests outside of your boyfriend. That might help you feel more secure and less jealous."
* "I think you're being unfair to your boyfriend. He's moved on and is just trying to maintain a friendship with someone from his past. You need to trust him and have faith in your relationship. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you need to work on building your own self-confidence and self-worth."

TITLE: Dropping everything and leaving my life behind tonight, any suggestions?

POST: I'm packing up my shit and leaving tonight. I'm a 20 year old male who's been dicked around by just about everyone in his life ("omg 20 years old get over it"), and is sick of it. I'm not stupid, I realize this is a bad idea, but I really have nothing left. My parents have been promising to sign school loans for three years and have yet to fulfill that promise (which is fine, I don't care anymore). I have been living with my grandparents house and sharing a car with them for about a year now, which is making me feel worse, because who wants to share a car with their grandparents? I was going to move in with my girlfriend in a week and start a new job in the city, but she changed her mind and said she "wasn't ready for us to move in together" after knowing each other for 10+ years, so I decided breaking it off with her would be for the best. I'm not doing this as some pretentious, angst-driven statement against my parents or anyone else, I just want some different for myself, and this isn't cutting it for me. Anyway, my question is, any tips for someone who's about to take off with $200 in their pocket and a duffel bag full of clothes? Have any redditors ever done something like this before?

TL;DR: I'm 20, fed up with my life, and leaving tonight with $200 and a duffel bag. Any advice?

**REDDIT RESPONSES**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, I did something similar when I was 19. I left my hometown with $100 and a backpack and ended up in a new city. It was scary, but it was also liberating. My advice is to just go with it and see where life takes you. You might find something amazing, or you might struggle, but at least you'll be doing something different. Just make sure you have a plan for food and shelter, and try to stay safe.
2. **SarcasticSally**: Oh boy, you're really doing this, huh? I mean, I get it, life can be tough, but running away with $200 and a duffel bag is not the answer. You're going to end up in a bad situation, or worse, stuck in a rut. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They can help you work through your issues and find a more constructive way to deal with your emotions. Trust me, you don't want to end up on the streets with no money and no plan.
3. **TravelingTom**: I've been on the road for years, and I've seen some crazy stuff. If you're really set on leaving, I'd say go for it! Just make sure you're prepared for the unexpected. Pack some snacks, bring a tent, and try to stay positive. You never know what amazing experiences you might have. Just be careful, and don't do anything stupid.
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: I'm going to say this, and I hope you listen: running away with $200 and a duffel bag is a recipe for disaster. You're not thinking about the consequences, and you're not considering the people who care about you. Your parents might be frustrating, but they're still your parents, and they want what's best for you. Your girlfriend might have hurt you, but she's still someone who cares about you. Don't throw away your life on a whim. Take a step back, breathe, and think about what you're really doing.

**CONCLUSION**

The post has received a mix of responses, ranging from encouraging and adventurous to cautionary and concerned. Some redditors are urging the OP to take a leap of faith and see where life takes him, while others are warning him about the potential dangers and consequences of his actions. The post has sparked a lively discussion about the pros and cons of running away from one's problems, and the importance of considering the potential outcomes before making a drastic decision. Ultimately, the OP will have to weigh the advice and opinions of the community and decide what's best for himself. Will he take the plunge and start a new life, or will he reconsider and find a more constructive way to deal with his emotions? Only time will tell.

TITLE: Should I (18/M) write to this girl (18/F) i met at the club the other night?

POST: Hey guys
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here it goes.

So this past week I was in a foreign country with some friends. We went to a club one night and met a group of girls and shared a table with them. 

This one girl and I started dancing and in no time we were making out. I don't know for how long, could have been 5 minutes, could have been 30 (too drunk to remember). I don't remember how we were separated either. 
We were supposed to meet them again the day after, but for some reason we were late and many of them just went home. She didn't though. 

They were three girls who had waited for us. We went to a bar that night and I sat down next to her. We talked, but the conversation didn't go to any personal level. 

We ended that night with a quick hug. The day after I (and my group of friends) went back home. I added her on facebook.

It has now been 4 days since the night we were making out and I just feel so empty. Now I'm always tired and quiet and just can't stop thinking about her. I want to write to her, but I don't even know if she feels the same way. 

So my questions are
Do I write to her or not?
If yes, what do I write?

TL;DR: Met a girl at a club, made out with her, didn't get her number, and now I'm thinking about her nonstop. Should I write to her and what should I write?

TITLE: Reddit, how can I deal with my bitchy roommate?

POST: I live in a two bedroom apartment with two girls in each room bedroom. Recently, one of the girls from the other room decided that the best way to tell us things was through passive-aggressive notes put in certain places as seen here:  (those are not the only ones). 

On top of that, she now decides that she hates my boyfriend because he comes over too often (in MY room, where she doesn't even have to see him), and because he doesn't lock the door when he leaves. She has called him a "douchebag", "faggot", "dick", etc. straight to my face, and told me to tell him to go home. She has no reason to even think that because all he's ever been is respectful to her and has even done favors for him.

The thing is, if she had been nice about it and told me directly that she had problems with something, I would be much more susceptible to change. But when she simply leaves notes all over the place and then blows up and bitches people out when things don't change, I have no respect for her.

What should I do? :/

TL;DR: Roommate is being super passive-aggressive and rude, and I don't know how to deal with it.

**Comments:**

* "Have you talked to your other roommate about this? Maybe she's not aware of how her roommate is acting and can help mediate the situation."
* "I would suggest having a calm and respectful conversation with your roommate about how her behavior is affecting you. Try to avoid getting defensive and focus on how you're feeling."
* "I would also suggest setting some boundaries with your roommate. Let her know that you're not comfortable with her leaving notes and that you'd prefer it if she talked to you directly."
* "Have you considered talking to your landlord or a resident advisor about the situation? They may be able to help mediate the situation or provide guidance on how to handle it."
* "I would also suggest keeping a record of the notes and any incidents that occur. This can be helpful in case you need to escalate the situation to a higher authority."
* "I would also suggest trying to find common ground with your roommate. Maybe there's something that you both have in common that you can use to build a connection and improve your relationship."
* "I would also suggest being more understanding and empathetic towards your roommate. Maybe she's going through a tough time and is taking it out on you. Try to see things from her perspective and see if you can find a way to help her."
* "I would also suggest setting some ground rules for your living situation. Let your roommate know what you're comfortable with and what you're not. This can help prevent future conflicts."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice! I think I'm going to try to have a calm and respectful conversation with my roommate about how her behavior is affecting me. I'll also try to set some boundaries and see if we can find some common ground. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!"

TITLE: Me [20M] with my girlfriend[19F] 4 months, long distance ideas?

POST: Me and my gf met each other online and still have not seen each other in person. That has not stopped us and we video chat often, and even fall asleep to each others faces on Skype. 

I will be leaving for the military and am putting together an "Open When" letter box for her and stuff to hold her over while I a away. Yes, I know it usually works the other way but I wanted to surprise her.
   
Anyway, I will be putting things like photos and gifts. She is worried because she has gotten used to falling asleep with me like over the phone. I want some ideas on how to like... be there when i'm not there. I don't know about a video or voicemail that she will play on a loop because I feel like she will over play it and it will lose it's meaning. What are some ideas for a long distance couple that wants to feel like the other is there when we can't be?

TL;DR: Long distance couple, 4 months, military deployment coming up. Want ideas on how to make my girlfriend feel like I'm there when I'm not.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "That's so sweet! I think you're on the right track with the 'Open When' letter box. You could also consider setting up a virtual 'date night' schedule, where you both agree to watch the same movie or TV show at the same time and discuss it over video call. It'll give you something to look forward to and make you feel more connected."
2. **u/longdistancerules**: "I'm a long distance couple myself, and I can attest that it's all about finding ways to stay connected and make each other feel special. You could also try sending her care packages with small gifts or treats that remind her of you. And don't underestimate the power of a good old-fashioned phone call. Sometimes it's nice to just talk and catch up without the distraction of video."
3. **u/relationshipgoals**: "Aww, that's so romantic! I think your idea of setting up a 'Open When' letter box is genius. You could also consider setting up a shared online journal or scrapbook where you both can write notes and share memories. It'll be a great way to stay connected and look back on your time together."
4. **u/longdistanceproblems**: "I'm a bit of a cynic, but I think your idea of setting up a video or voicemail loop is actually a great idea. It's not about overplaying it, but about having a constant reminder of each other. You could also try setting up a shared playlist of songs that are special to your relationship and listening to it together over video call."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're on the right track with your ideas, but I would also suggest taking some time to talk to your girlfriend about what she needs and wants from you during this time. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and needs, especially in a long distance relationship. Good luck, and I hope you both stay strong!"

TITLE: Is there a chance that I [19/m] am screwing this up with my (19/f) girlfriend?

POST: We've developed an extremely strong semi-long distance relationship. She only drinks on very few occasions and only smokes hookah every once in a while. I smoke weed/tobacco, drink, and do other drugs almost daily. She says she doesn't care, but I still refuse to smoke a tobacco product in front of her. We both fully plan on staying together throughout college and eventually ending up together. She seems to truly not care and we both believe that I will calm down as I develop more of a routine and grow up, and I believe that at this age if we are to stay together this age is the last chance I have to do these 'wild' things.

TL;DR: Girlfriend doesn't care about my substance use, but I'm hesitant to do it in front of her. Should I be worried about ruining our relationship?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not about her not caring, it's about you not being honest with yourself. You're using substances daily and it's affecting your relationship. You're not being open with her about your habits and that's causing tension. You need to be honest with yourself and her about your substance use and how it's impacting your relationship."
2. **u/relationship_guru**: "It's not about the substances themselves, it's about the lack of transparency and trust in your relationship. If you're not willing to be open and honest with your girlfriend about your habits, it's going to create a rift in your relationship. You need to have a real conversation with her about your substance use and how it affects you and your relationship."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you're overthinking this. If your girlfriend truly doesn't care about your substance use, then maybe you're just making a big deal out of nothing. But at the same time, it's not like you're doing anything illegal or harmful to yourself or others. Maybe just have an open and honest conversation with her about your habits and see how she reacts. If she's still okay with it, then maybe you're just being paranoid."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm a bit skeptical about your girlfriend's claims that she doesn't care. People often say they don't care about things they actually do care about. If she's really okay with your substance use, then why are you hesitant to do it in front of her? Maybe she's just saying what she thinks you want to hear. You need to have a real conversation with her about your habits and see if she's truly okay with them or if she's just pretending to be okay with it."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're making a big mistake by assuming that your girlfriend will just 'get over it' as you grow up. Relationships are about communication, trust, and honesty. If you're not willing to be open and honest with your girlfriend about your substance use, then you're not building a strong foundation for your relationship. You need to have a real conversation with her about your habits and see if you're on the same page. If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you."

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 7 years have vastly different sexual pleasures. Is this something that will become a constant sore point for the rest of our lives?

POST: Me and my long term girlfriend have been together for a little over 7 years now. We have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years due to our studies. We long our virginities to each other and from there we began to explore a bit.

I have been watching porn for 10 years and have built up various fetishes and sexual desires. My girlfriend on the other hand had barely begun to touch herself when we met and had little to no idea about what she liked or what she wanted to try. So we used my 'knowlegde' to try several things and see what we liked.

During this time we tried several things ranging from your normal passionate sex to public sex and from mild bdsm to anal. What became clear after several years of exploring is that we both have quite different tastes. She prefers passionate normal sex and occasionally being restrained. I'm into things such as anal play and exhibitionism. She is very specific about what she likes now and I'm still very open and willing to do pretty much anything. This is starting to bring a bit of conflict as I become bored with all of these restrictions she has now put in place so that she stays in her comfort zone.

It's difficult for us both to enjoy sex to its fullest extent at the same time as I want to do certain things that she won't do and she wants to do things that we've done a thousand times and don't really excite me anymore.

I'm not going to pack in the relationship over this as I love her and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I want to know if this is going to be a source of conflict for the rest of our relationship, and if anyone has any advice or ideas regarding this?

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have been together for 7 years, we have different sexual desires. I'm into anal play and exhibitionism, she prefers passionate normal sex and occasional restraint. We're having trouble finding a compromise and I'm worried this will be a constant source of conflict in our relationship.

COMMENTS:

* "It's not uncommon for couples to have different sexual desires, and it's great that you're willing to work through this together. Have you tried having open and honest conversations about what you both want and need? It might help to create a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm a bit surprised that you're only now realizing this, given your 10-year porn habit. It's possible that you've been desensitized to your own desires and needs. Have you considered seeking out couples therapy to work through these issues?"
* "It's great that you're willing to compromise, but it's also important to prioritize your own needs and desires. Maybe it's time to start exploring your own desires and needs outside of the relationship, and see if that brings you more fulfillment."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to work through this together. Have you considered setting boundaries and communicating your needs and desires more clearly? It might help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts in the future."
* "It's not uncommon for people to have different sexual desires, and it's great that you're willing to work through this together. Have you tried having a 'no' list, where you both agree on what you're not comfortable with? It might help to create a sense of safety and trust in the relationship."

Overall, the comments are supportive and encouraging, with many people offering suggestions for how the couple can work through their differences and find a compromise that works for both of them. Some people also caution against prioritizing one's own desires over the other person's, and suggest seeking out couples therapy to work through these issues. The comments also highlight the importance of communication and setting boundaries in the relationship.

TITLE: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?

POST: Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). 
* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.
* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. 

What do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Former roommate took my security deposit. I need help figuring out what to do.

**Comments:**

* "You're not a bad person for wanting your deposit back, but you also need to consider the circumstances. The guy had to sell his car to make ends meet, and the girl was pregnant. Maybe try to have a calm conversation with them and see if you can come to a compromise. Maybe they can pay you back in installments or something."
* "I think you're being a bit too generous. You paid your share of the bills, and you're entitled to your deposit back. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and ask for what's rightfully yours."

TITLE: TIFU by accidentally overdosing on dextroamphetamine (ADD medication) on the day of my endwork presentation. [NSFW]

POST: So yesterday was a rough day. I still had a LOT of work to do, things like making the actual scale model of the home design I presented today and the powerpoint presentation.

I was able to make a presentable presentation, but only got 4 hours of sleep because of it. I think the lack of sleep is what caused my body to be incapable of processing my normally prescribed dosage this morning.

So today as I arrived at school I already knew I was sweating a hell of a lot more than I was supposed to. Feeling cold and sweaty is a miserable feeling. Though I assumed it was just a common cold or something. That all changed when I checked my armpits. Seriously I regret wearing a gray shirt today.

My armpits were just *drained* with sweat.

I could feel the sweat drip down my arm pits drop by drop every minute, what just made more nervous. After an hour my sweater was no longer able to contain the sweat, and it was so visible I didn't even need to lift my arms for people to notice. It didn't make me feel awkward towards my friends, I just laugh it off with them.

But then it was time for me to present my design to the external jury. 7 well respected teachers and architects gave me 30 min of their time for me to defend my work.

I just know that they noticed it and it distracted them and it distracted me. Too awkward for them to mention it. Too awkward for me to not ignore it. Yet I accepted the awkwardness and was able to give a somewhat terrible presentation because I got verbal ticks along with the overdose. But they loved the design at least after I explained everything twice.

After school was done I took a piss before I went home, which was also a bad idea. It felt like passing a kidney stone and gave me a throbbing painful erection for a good 30 minutes.

Now here I am, sitting at home because I can't stop sweating, feeling exhausted, heartbeat still around 100.
I'm just having a bad day.

TL;DR: I accidentally overdosed on my ADD medication and had a terrible day. I was sweating excessively, had a bad presentation, and had a weirdly painful erection. I'm just glad it's over.

EDITS:

* Added more details about the presentation and the sweating
* Changed the title to make it more descriptive
* Added a TL;DR for easier reading
* Changed the formatting to make it easier to read

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author accidentally overdosed on their ADD medication, which led to a series of embarrassing and uncomfortable events, including excessive sweating, a bad presentation, and a weirdly painful erection. The post is well-written and entertaining, with a good balance of humor and self-deprecation. The author's willingness to share their embarrassing story and poke fun at themselves makes the post enjoyable to read. [NSFW] refers to the fact that the post contains some mature themes and language.

SUBREDDIT: r/Advice

TITLE: Urgent: How to best take a beating in a fist fight?

POST: I only need/ can use advice about defending myself.  
  
Back story:  
I serve in the military (not US) right now, and have lately been threatened by someone, after an unfortunate exchange of insults.  
I am noticeably bigger than him, and none of us have practiced martial arts, other than basic melee training in the military itself.  
  
I tried to defuse the situation more than once.  
I can't "snitch" about it, because that would create hostility between me and his friends.  
I am near this guy 24 hours a day for the next 6 weeks.  
I cannot go on the offense in any shape or form, otherwise I will be sent into military prison and loose a bunch of hard earned privileges.  
My only hope to come out clean is to take a beating and wait until a superior comes to defuse the situation, with the other guy being sent to military prison and such.

TL;DR: I'm in a situation where I'm being threatened by someone, and I need advice on how to take a beating without getting seriously hurt, while also waiting for a superior to intervene.

ADVICE FROM REDDITORS:

1. **Stay calm and focused**: Try to remain calm and focused, even if the other guy is getting aggressive. This will help you think more clearly and make better decisions.
2. **Use your size to your advantage**: Since you're bigger than the other guy, use your size to your advantage. Keep your distance and use your reach to keep him at bay.
3. **Protect your vital organs**: Make sure to protect your vital organs, such as your head, neck, and chest. Keep your hands up and use your arms to block any incoming punches.
4. **Use your legs**: Use your legs to defend yourself. Kick the other guy in the stomach or groin to try and take him down.
5. **Wait for a superior to intervene**: Since you're waiting for a superior to intervene, try to stay calm and focused and wait for them to arrive.
6. **Don't engage in a fight you can't win**: Remember that you're not trying to win the fight, you're just trying to survive until a superior arrives. Don't engage in a fight you can't win, and try to avoid getting into a situation where you're outnumbered or outmatched.
7. **Keep your cool and don't get emotional**: It's easy to get emotional during a fight, but try to keep your cool and stay calm. This will help you think more clearly and make better decisions.
8. **Use your surroundings to your advantage**: Look for any objects or surfaces that you can use to your advantage. For example, you could use a nearby wall or door to block the other guy's punches or kicks.
9. **Don't try to take on the other guy's friends**: If the other guy has friends who are trying to intervene, don't try to take on all of them at once. Instead, focus on defending yourself against the one guy who is threatening you.
10. **Remember that you're not alone**: Remember that you're not alone in this situation. There are people who care about you and want to help you. Keep your cool and wait for a superior to arrive, and you'll get through this.

Remember, the most important thing is to stay safe and avoid getting seriously hurt. If you're in a situation where you feel like you're in danger, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are people who care about you and want to help you.

TITLE: Me [17M] with my long distance girlfriend [15F] of six months, I'm leaving for two months and I want to make it easier on her

POST: In three months I'll be leaving for Navy boot camp; in boot camp you can write letters daily, but that's effectively it for communication on the outside. Now, I'm sure we'll make it on fine through it, seeing as we're a very strong couple and the letters will make it much much more doable, but I was wondering if there's anything I could do or could send before (or after) those two weeks come, because I know it's going to be stressful on her part.

We Skype and sleep on Skype every night, always send big good morning texts to each other, and are simply very involved in each other's lives, and this is going to be a big change for her and I would really love to hear anything and everything people have to say.

Thank you for all the help that I may get, friends!

TL;DR: Leaving for Navy boot camp in three months, want to make it easier on my long distance girlfriend by doing something special before/after the two weeks of no communication.

**Comments:**

* "Send her a care package with some of her favorite snacks, a cozy blanket, and a handwritten letter expressing your feelings and gratitude for her support. It'll be a nice surprise and a reminder that you're thinking of her during this tough time." (u/throwaway123456)
* "Have you considered setting up a countdown calendar with notes and reminders for her? It could be a fun way to mark the days until you're back in touch. You could also include little surprises like a new book or a funny meme to brighten her day." (u/relationshipgoals)
* "I went through a similar experience with my girlfriend when I was deployed. We set up a schedule for our daily letters and also exchanged care packages. It was a great way to stay connected and feel like we were still a part of each other's daily lives. You could also consider setting up a shared online journal or scrapbook where you both can write notes and share memories." (u/USNavyVet)
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your girlfriend's feelings during this time. Have you considered talking to her about what she needs from you during this period? It's possible that she has some specific requests or concerns that you're not aware of. Open communication is key in any relationship, especially during challenging times." (u/relationshipcoach)
* "I'm a big fan of sending surprise gifts in the mail. It could be something small like a favorite snack or a fun mug, or something bigger like a care package with all her favorite things. The surprise and thoughtfulness will mean a lot to her and make the time apart feel more manageable." (u/surpriseparty)

TITLE: I (20'sM) think my cousin is going to tell me she (30'sF) is having a kid, I'm worried that my true feeling will show.

POST: My cousin is very close, like a sister, we were raised together.

She announced a few months ago that she and her long-time BF (30s) wanted to have a kid despite the fact that she has for her entire life said that she never wanted kids (we both had rough childhoods).

She has invited me and my Dad over to her and her BF's place for dinner next week, despite the fact that she almost never initiates those kinds of things, and that their money is pretty tight at the moment.

Other things (including the weird dinner invitation) have led me to believe that she is going to announce something big, and one of the few things I can think of are that she is pregnant.

I, for various reasons, don't think her (or her BF) would make good parents. I'm not going to argue with them about it, or make a big scene, or even make mention of my feelings. It's their decision, and nothing I say or do is going to change their decision.

What I'm worried about is hurting their feelings by not being immediately happy for them. She is kind of emotionally fragile, and uh... Histrionic?

I'm not good at hiding or faking emotions like this... It really has me worried. What can I do?

TL;DR: My cousin is probably going to announce she's having a kid, I'm worried about showing my true feelings, which are that I don't think they'd make good parents. How can I hide my emotions?

---

This post is a great example of how people can struggle with navigating complex social situations, especially when it comes to family relationships. The OP (original poster) is worried about hurting his cousin's feelings by not being immediately happy for her, despite his reservations about her ability to be a good parent.

The OP is aware that his cousin is emotionally fragile and has a tendency to be histrionic, which makes him even more concerned about how to handle the situation. He's worried that his true feelings will show on his face or in his body language, and that this could lead to an uncomfortable or even confrontational conversation.

The post highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in these situations. The OP is not trying to be cruel or dismissive of his cousin's decision, but rather is concerned about the potential consequences of his own emotions. He's looking for advice on how to navigate this situation with sensitivity and tact.

The comments on this post offer a range of advice and perspectives, from suggestions on how to fake a smile and hide one's emotions, to more nuanced discussions about the importance of honesty and authenticity in relationships. Some commenters encourage the OP to be honest with his cousin, while others advise him to prioritize maintaining a positive relationship and avoid rocking the boat.

Overall, this post is a great example of how people can struggle with complex social situations, and how important it is to approach these situations with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to listen and communicate effectively.

TITLE: My [24M] new girlfriend [21F] lied to me about using protection with other guys

POST: I'll keep this short:

I've been hooking up with this girl for half a year now, and we've only been official last month. When we were just fooling around, I told her that if she ever hooked up with other guys, I just wanted to know that she used protection.

There's this one guy in question that she said she blacked out and can't be completely sure, but she thinks she did. I trusted her and we ended up dating.

Now I find out from her friend (who screenshot their text conversation) that she did NOT use protection during that night in question. She clearly wrote it to her friend.

I feel like my trust was betrayed. I'm a little disgusted with this. She probably didn't want to tell me because she wanted to keep seeing me (and now we're dating), but she knows I'm serious about these things and I can't believe this happened.

Beyond that, we've been pretty solid. 

How should I deal with this?

TL;DR: Girlfriend lied about using protection with other guys, I found out from her friend's screenshot. I feel betrayed and disgusted. What do I do?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not just about the protection. It's about the fact that she lied to you. That's a huge red flag. You deserve better than someone who can't be honest with you." (123 upvotes)
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not just about the protection, it's about the trust. If she can't be honest with you about something as important as that, what else is she hiding?" (98 upvotes)
* "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you feel. Let her know that you feel betrayed and that you need to know why she lied to you. Maybe she has a good reason, maybe she doesn't. But you need to know the truth." (74 upvotes)
* "I would say it's time to reevaluate the relationship. If she can't be honest with you about something like this, what else is she going to lie to you about? You deserve someone who is willing to be open and honest with you." (63 upvotes)
* "I think you should take some time to think about whether you want to continue the relationship. It's not just about the lying, it's about the fact that she didn't respect your boundaries and your feelings. You deserve someone who respects you and your boundaries." (56 upvotes)

**Note:** The comments are a mix of opinions, but the majority of them suggest that the OP should have a calm and honest conversation with his girlfriend about how he feels, and that the lying is a significant red flag that may indicate deeper issues in the relationship. Some comments also suggest that the OP should reevaluate the relationship and consider whether he wants to continue it. None of the comments condone the girlfriend's behavior or suggest that the OP should just "get over it." The comments are generally supportive and encouraging of the OP to prioritize his own feelings and well-being.

TITLE: Ex-cheaters of reddit, is it honestly possible to ever rebuild trust with your SO? If so, how?

POST: A little bit of back story.

 So I've been with an amazing girl for over 3 years now but back when we met I was a stupid 16 year old boy who had just started getting attention from girls. So like an idiot i fooled around behind her back with a few girls and she later found out, and by later I mean 2 years later when I finally confessed. She always had suspicions but I was never man enough to admit to it. Now the problem is that even though its been a year since she found out there is no trust in the relationship. She doesn't trust me to do literally anything. If there are any other redditors who have ever been in a similar situation, is it even possible to get past this? I'm older now and I realized that she means the world to me and I just want to move forward in our relationship but it feels pretty hopeless right now..

TL;DR: Ex-cheater here, wondering if it's possible to rebuild trust with my SO after confessing to infidelity 2 years after the fact. Any advice from fellow redditors who have been in similar situations?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456789**: "Honestly, it's not just about confessing and apologizing. You need to show her that you're committed to changing and growing as a person. That means being transparent, accountable, and willing to work through the hard stuff. It's not going to be easy, but if you're willing to put in the effort, it's possible to rebuild trust. Just remember that trust is something that's earned, not given."
2. **CheaterNoMore**: "I was in a similar situation and it took me a long time to realize that I needed to take responsibility for my actions. I had to own up to my mistakes and make amends. It wasn't easy, but my partner and I worked through it together. Now, we're stronger than ever. The key is to be honest, communicate openly, and be willing to do the hard work to rebuild trust."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely not easy. You need to understand that your partner's trust was broken, and it's going to take time to rebuild. You need to be patient, understanding, and willing to work through the tough times. It's not just about apologizing and moving on. You need to show her that you're committed to being a better partner and person."
4. **Redditor123**: "I've been in a similar situation, and it took me a long time to realize that I needed to take responsibility for my actions. I had to own up to my mistakes and make amends. It wasn't easy, but my partner and I worked through it together. Now, we're stronger than ever. The key is to be honest, communicate openly, and be willing to do the hard work to rebuild trust."
5. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely not easy. You need to understand that your partner's trust was broken, and it's going to take time to rebuild. You need to be patient, understanding, and willing to work through the tough times. It's not just about apologizing and moving on. You need to show her that you're committed to being a better partner and person."

**Conclusion:**

The top comments on this post offer a mix of advice and personal experiences from fellow redditors who have been in similar situations. The general consensus is that rebuilding trust takes time, effort, and commitment from both partners. It's not just about apologizing and moving on, but about being willing to work through the tough times and show your partner that you're committed to being a better person and partner. The key is to be honest, communicate openly, and be patient and understanding. While it's not easy, it's possible to rebuild trust and move forward in a relationship.

TITLE: I want to join the police, specifically AFP, would joining a branch of the Australian Military help me?

POST: As said in the title, I'm an Australian, I'm 19 almost 20, haven't got my license yet and I'm working a dead end office job. I have always wanted to join the police though they said they prefer people 21 and older with life experience, so I am sitting in this shitty job with my shitty life, and hating it, so I decided maybe joining a branch of the Australian Military would help me, would that be something they would love to see on a resume?
If so, where in the military should I join? Typical Army? Become a sniper? Or maybe Navy, I want something active and never boring.
I know this isn't the most typical question, but I'm desperate, I need something new and have always considered joining the military for a back up plan but this would be something good for my resume when I go to join the police, yes?

Any information would be greatly appreciated, tips, inputs and just your opinion on the matter would help.

TL;DR: I want to join the police, specifically AFP, but they prefer people 21 and older with life experience. I'm 19 almost 20, working a dead end job, and considering joining the Australian Military to gain experience and make my resume look better for the police. Where should I join? Typical Army? Navy? Something else?

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: Mate, I'm not sure if joining the military will directly help you with your police application, but it's definitely a great way to gain experience and skills. If you're looking for something active and never boring, I'd recommend the Army or Air Force. They have a lot of opportunities for deployment and adventure. As for becoming a sniper, it's a tough and competitive role, but if you're interested, go for it! Just keep in mind that you'll need to meet certain physical and mental requirements.

2. **u/PoliceOfficer123**: I'm a current AFP officer, and I can tell you that while having military experience is great, it's not a guarantee of getting hired. What's more important is having relevant skills and experience in areas like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. If you're serious about joining the police, I'd recommend focusing on developing those skills rather than just joining the military for the sake of it.

3. **u/AussieSoldier**: Mate, I've been in the Army for a few years now, and I can tell you that it's a great way to gain experience and skills. If you're looking for something active and never boring, I'd recommend joining the Army's Special Forces or the Air Force's Special Operations Command. They're both great units that offer a lot of opportunities for adventure and deployment. Just keep in mind that you'll need to meet certain physical and mental requirements.

4. **u/ReserveOfficer**: I'm a Reserve Officer with the Army, and I can tell you that it's a great way to gain experience and skills while still having a civilian job. If you're looking for something active and never boring, I'd recommend joining the Army Reserve or the Air Force Reserve. They're both great units that offer a lot of opportunities for deployment and adventure. Just keep in mind that you'll need to meet certain physical and mental requirements.

5. **u/PoliceRecruit**: I'm a current police recruit, and I can tell you that having military experience is definitely an advantage when applying to the police. However, it's not the only thing that matters. What's more important is having relevant skills and experience in areas like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. If you're serious about joining the police, I'd recommend focusing on developing those skills rather than just joining the military for the sake of it.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my GF[24 M/F] of 2 1/2 years, broke up and I do not know how to analyze my emotions.

POST: We were college sweethearts and we always had a solid relationship. She is the shy nervous type, but I loved that about her. After 1 year and 7 months I had to move for school, which led into a long distance relationship.

The distance really was difficult for both of us. She worked a night schedule and I worked a day schedule but we still managed to call every night. After a while, I tried to convince her to move to my side of the state. She did not really like her job that much (under payed) and I had a hard time finding a job on her side of the state (2 hours away). 

She expressed a feeling of not knowing what she wanted to do with her career, leading her to not be able to commit looking for work near me. She was always really nervous with decisions and really feared drastic change. So I didn't push her, even though the distance was getting too both of us. She has to do whats best for her.

Suddenly, that excuse ended up ending the relationship. She acted distant randomly as I visited her for the week (this was later in the week) and I called her out on it. She told me she doesn't know what she wants for her life and wants to be alone at this point in her life. She told me she loved me and as I left her house, I told her I hope shes finds what makes her happy and that I loved her. We were both in tears as I walked down her porch.

It has been a week since then and I am up-and-down each day. Happy,Sad,Confident, Self-loathing, miserable, ecstatic and most of all confused. I do still love her and I really don't know how to analyze what I am feeling. The breakup was out of nowhere. I just want to know that this type of things happens..because I personally don't understand it completely.

TL;DR: 2 1/2 year relationship ends due to her not knowing what she wants for her life and wanting to be alone. I'm struggling to understand and analyze my emotions.

**Empathetic comments:**

* "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like a really tough breakup. It's understandable that you're feeling all over the place. Just remember that it's okay to feel whatever emotions come up, and it's normal to take time to process everything."
* "I went through a similar situation a few years ago, and it was really tough. But I learned that it's okay to take time for yourself and focus on your own healing. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to be kind to yourself as you navigate this new chapter."
* "I can totally relate to feeling confused and up-and-down after a breakup. It's like your emotions are all over the place. Just remember that it's a normal part of the healing process, and it will get better with time."

**Practical advice:**

* "It sounds like you're feeling a lot of emotions, but also a lot of uncertainty. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through? They can help you process your emotions and gain some clarity on what you're feeling."
* "I would suggest taking some time for yourself to reflect on the relationship and what you learned from it. What were some of the things that you loved about your partner, and what were some of the things that you struggled with? Reflecting on the relationship can help you gain some closure and move forward."
* "It might be helpful to focus on self-care right now. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking time to relax and unwind. Exercise can also be a great way to release endorphins and improve your mood. Just remember to be gentle with yourself and take things one day at a time."

**Questions and concerns:**

* "I'm curious, did you feel like you were supporting her in her career goals and aspirations, or did you feel like she was leaning on you to make decisions for her?"
* "How did you feel about her wanting to be alone at this point in her life? Was that something that you were prepared for, or did it come as a surprise to you?"
* "Have you considered reaching out to her to talk about the breakup and what happened? Sometimes having a conversation can help clarify things and provide closure."

TITLE: I [25M] cannot be myself around my family, because everything I do is "strange".

POST: I am a senior biochemistry major, enjoy old music - huge deadhead- and really love writing. However, my family is nothing like me. They are narrow-minded straight ticket Republican voters, none of them have ever gone to college, and they all love modern pop country music; not that I mind, I just think that says a lot about a person.

Now, I could deal with those differences if they stopped there. The deeper issues are grounded in their ignorance of my intrinsic personality and their obstinacy towards simply trying to understand. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features in high school and then Bipolar 1 later on. On many days, all I can do is lie in the dark and list reasons to continue living.

This frequent inability to do anything is viewed as lazy by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. However, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.

I have stayed with friends on multiple occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.

I really just want to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented on. How do I get out of this mindset and become the person I want to be?

TL;DR: I'm a 25-year-old biochemistry major with depression and bipolar disorder. My family is very conservative and doesn't understand me. They berate me for my depression and make me feel like I'm lazy. I've found temporary relief when I'm away from them, but when I come back, they make me feel like I'm broken. I want to be myself, but I feel trapped. How do I break free?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your family is incredibly toxic and damaging to your mental health. Have you considered therapy? A professional can help you work through your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. Also, have you talked to your family about your depression and bipolar disorder? Sometimes educating people about mental health can help them understand and be more supportive.
2. **depressed_and_proud**: OP, I feel you. I've been there too. It's like you're living in a constant state of anxiety and fear, wondering when your family will "snap out of it" and accept you for who you are. I've learned to set boundaries and prioritize my own well-being. I've also found solace in online communities like this one. Remember, you're not alone.
3. **mental_health_warrior**: OP, I'm so proud of you for speaking out about your struggles. It takes a lot of courage to share your story. I want to emphasize that your depression and bipolar disorder are not a result of your laziness or anything else your family might say. You are not broken. You are strong and capable, and you deserve to be loved and accepted for who you are.
4. **old_music_fan**: OP, I'm a huge Deadhead too! I'm so sorry to hear about your struggles with your family. It's amazing that you've found solace in music and writing. Keep doing what makes you happy, and don't let anyone bring you down. You are not alone, and there are people out there who understand and care about you.
5. **PhD_in_neurobiology**: OP, I'm a neurobiologist myself, and I'm so impressed by your academic achievements. You are an inspiration. I want to encourage you to keep pursuing your dreams, even if it means leaving your family behind. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and I believe you can achieve that. Remember, you are strong and capable, and you have a whole community of people who support you.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all so much for your kind words and advice. It means a lot to me to know that I'm not alone in this struggle. I have considered therapy, but my family is very resistant to the idea. They think it's a waste of time and money. As for talking to them about my depression and bipolar disorder, I've tried, but they just don't listen. They think I'm attention-seeking or trying to get sympathy.

I do appreciate your suggestions about setting boundaries and prioritizing my own well-being. I've been trying to do that, but it's hard when you feel like you're being judged and criticized all the time.

I'm glad to hear that I'm not the only one who has struggled with this. It's nice to know that there are people out there who understand what I'm going through.

Thank you again for your support. It means a lot to me. I'm going to keep trying to be myself, even if it means leaving my family behind. I deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and I'm going to make sure that I get that.

TITLE: I think I have some form of PTSD?

POST: I'm not sure if that's what it is. Sorry if that's offensive to call it that when it's probably something else. 

July of last year, my friend was texting me constantly on her roadtrip. Her friend rolled their car and my friend was rushed to the hospital and went into a coma for a few weeks. She ended up being ok but I originally thought she was ignoring me or lost service. In September, I was texting a friend of mine when she fell asleep and died in a house fire. I didn't know about the fire until a few days later, I kept texting her thinking she was ignoring me. Two months ago, I had text my friend in the morning and he agreed to meet me at my house later that afternoon to hang out. When he didn't show up, I kept texting him and calling him. I thought he was ignoring me, turns out he had killed himself a few hours before. 

Now whenever I'm texting someone and they don't reply within a few hours I freak out. I panic, start crying, call them, call someone who might know if they are still alive/ok. Basically full blow panic attacks. It's really embarrassing when they tell me to stop freaking out they just fell asleep/lost their phone/were riding unicorns. Should I talk to someone about this? Just get over myself?

TL;DR: I've had three close friends die or nearly die in the past year and now I freak out when someone doesn't reply to my texts within a few hours. Is this PTSD? Should I talk to someone about this?

TITLE: Me [26/F] with my boyfriend [28 M] 2 years;Will he propose on vacation?/Why won't people stop asking me that?

POST: BF and I are headed on a two week vacation to Europe, leaving Friday. We have lived together for six months, been together two years, and many of our friends are now married or engaged. 

Getting engaged on vacation seems to be en vogue these days. So now, I've had multiple friends, and most recently my father(!) as me if we're getting engaged on this trip. 

This is terrible for a number of reasons. 

1) Thanks friends for putting that thought in my mind!! 
2) How do I know? 

Anyway, I am ready to be engaged. He is my one. We've discussed everything from parenting styles to wedding seating (if you have aunts Sandy, Irene, Rita and Katrina, you HAVE to have a hurricane table, right??). 

He is financially comfortable, we are both at stable places in our lives, and we are very happy. So is he going to do it? 

But I also don't know if he is ready, and that is fine with me! I would very enthusiastically say yes if he asked, but I wouldn't want to actually tie the knot until at least 2016. 

The problem:...these people have put the thought in my head! Now I'm afraid I'll ruin my vacation by expecting something at every romantic moment. How do I deal with this? How do I brush it off and just enjoy my vacation?

TL;DR: BF and I are going on vacation, and everyone keeps asking if we're getting engaged. I'm ready to be engaged, but I don't know if he is. How do I deal with the pressure and just enjoy my vacation?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, just tell your friends and family that you're not expecting anything and that you're just excited for the vacation. If they keep pushing, you can say something like 'I'd love to be engaged, but we're not there yet, let's just enjoy the trip and focus on us.'"
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think it's great that you're open to the idea of getting engaged, but maybe try to shift the focus away from the proposal and onto the vacation itself. You could say something like 'I'm really looking forward to exploring Europe and spending quality time with my boyfriend, let's just enjoy the trip and not worry about the future.'"
3. **romantic_rachel**: "I think it's sweet that your friends and family are excited for you, but maybe try to set some boundaries. You could say something like 'I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we're not expecting anything special on this trip, let's just enjoy each other's company.'"
4. **practical_pete**: "I think it's great that you're thinking about the future, but maybe try to focus on the present moment. You're on vacation, relax and enjoy it! Don't worry too much about what might happen in the future, just be present and enjoy the time with your boyfriend."
5. **worrywart_wendy**: "I totally get it, I've been in a similar situation before. Just try to take a deep breath and remind yourself that you can't control what others think or say. Focus on your own feelings and what you want, and don't let the pressure get to you. You're on vacation, enjoy it and don't worry about what might happen in the future!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all so much for your advice! I think I'm going to take a combination of all of your suggestions. I'll try to set some boundaries with my friends and family, and remind myself that I can't control what others think or say. I'll also try to focus on the present moment and enjoy the vacation with my boyfriend. And if he does propose, that's amazing, but if not, I'll be okay with that too. Thanks again for your support and advice!"

TITLE: Hearing Issues...

POST: Hello!

I am a 28 year old male that has had ongoing issues hearing people talking, on tv and directly to me.  I hear other noises, but talking is somewhat difficult, especially if there is any other noise going on at the same time.

i.e., I'm listening to music on my computer, next to a window that is very minimally open.  I'm about 50 or more feet away from the cars driving past, but when they do, my music goes into a muffled sound and I can't make out the words being sung.

Additionally, talking to people, I'm constantly being asked to repeat myself.  I'm also been told to turn the TV down pretty often.

I'm not on any medication that would be causing these issues.

TL;DR: I have difficulty hearing people talk, especially in noisy environments, and have trouble making out words on TV.  I'm not on any medication that could be causing this.

---

RESPONSE FROM A DOCTOR:

Hi there!

Thank you for sharing your concerns with us. It's great that you're seeking help for your hearing issues.

Based on your description, it's possible that you may be experiencing some degree of hearing loss or difficulty processing speech in noisy environments. There are a few potential explanations for this:

1. **Noise-induced hearing loss**: Prolonged exposure to loud noises, such as music or traffic, can cause permanent damage to your hearing. This can lead to difficulty hearing speech, especially in noisy environments.
2. **Sensorineural hearing loss**: This type of hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. It can cause difficulty hearing speech, especially in noisy environments.
3. **Auditory processing disorder**: This is a condition where the brain has difficulty processing auditory information, making it difficult to understand speech, especially in noisy environments.

To better understand your situation, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with an audiologist or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. They will be able to perform a comprehensive hearing evaluation to determine the cause of your hearing issues.

In the meantime, here are a few tips that may help:

* **Wear earplugs or earmuffs** when listening to loud music or in noisy environments to protect your hearing.
* **Find a quiet spot** to watch TV or have conversations to minimize background noise.
* **Ask people to speak clearly and slowly** when talking to you, especially in noisy environments.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

---

RESPONSE FROM A COMMENTER:

I had a similar issue and it turned out to be a problem with my eustachian tube. It's a tube that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat and helps regulate air pressure in your ears. Sometimes it can get blocked or inflamed, which can cause hearing issues. You might want to ask your doctor about it!

---

RESPONSE FROM ANOTHER COMMENTER:

I'm an audiologist and I can tell you that it's definitely possible that you're experiencing some degree of hearing loss. I would recommend getting a comprehensive hearing evaluation to determine the extent of your hearing loss and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, you might want to try using a hearing aid or a noise-cancelling device to help improve your ability to hear speech in noisy environments. Good luck!

TITLE: I [F22] just started dating my friend [M23] and I'm uncomfortable by his attitude towards his female friends/other women.

POST: So my friend and I recently decided to start dating. We had a casual, non-exclusive relationship for a few weeks, and last night I told him I wanted to be exclusive.

The thing is, he talks a lot about how attracted he is to other women. He told me pretty much any time a woman is wearing X or Y, regardless of who she is, he'll be horny. He keeps a lot of female friends on Facebook simply so he can look at their pictures (and I guess masturbate to them, I dunno, based on what he's told me before). He still talks to his ex's. 

And last night, after I had said I wanted to be exclusive and we were talking about something else, he said something along the lines of, "The physical half of my would fuck anyone who would fuck me. I'd fuck a pile of dirt if it felt good."

Am I weird for being upset by this? I understand being attracted to other people is part of life, and that doesn't bother me. I don't mind him watching porn or anything like that. It's the attitude of being willing to fuck pretty much anything that moves, having sexual feelings towards his female friends… I guess it's more personal than I'm comfortable with.

It just made me feel really shitty. Is this normal? Am I supposed to be okay with this stuff? I don't think he'd cheat on me, but I guess it makes me feel like sex with him is nothing special, and I don't like that feeling in a relationship. All of this just came to light last night after I told him I wanted to be exclusive. If I had known this stuff beforehand, I'm not sure I would've jumped into it.

TL;DR: I'm dating my friend, but he talks about being attracted to other women, has female friends he looks at for sexual gratification, and has a "fuck anything that feels good" attitude. I'm uncomfortable with this and feel like it makes me feel unimportant in the relationship. Am I being unreasonable?

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not being unreasonable at all. It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable with someone who has a 'fuck anything that feels good' attitude. That's not a healthy or respectful way to view relationships or people. You deserve better than someone who doesn't value your feelings or boundaries."
* "I think you're being way too sensitive. He's not saying he's going to cheat on you or anything. He's just saying he's attracted to other people. That's not a big deal. You're overthinking this."
* "I agree with OP. It's not just about being attracted to other people, it's the attitude and behavior that comes with it. If he's willing to objectify and use his female friends for sexual gratification, that's a red flag. OP deserves better than someone who doesn't respect her boundaries or the people around him."
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about how his words and behavior are making you feel. It's possible he doesn't realize the impact he's having and can work on being more considerate. But if he's not willing to listen or change, then maybe this relationship isn't for you."
* "I'm a woman and I've been in relationships with guys who have similar attitudes. And let me tell you, it's not fun. It makes you feel like you're not special or important to them. OP, you're not being unreasonable at all. You deserve someone who values and respects you, not someone who views you as just another option."

TITLE: Me [20F] with my ___ [20 M] 1 year 8 months, broke up three months ago, I can't get over it.

POST: I asked my now ex-boyfriend for a break while he was backpacking for a month after having been abroad for two months. I felt neglected and powerless. The relationship seemed entirely one-sided. I needed time to think if he was what I really wanted. We didn't talk for six weeks. When we finally talked, he was not interested in addressing the core issue. He implied that he didn't love me as much as I loved him. I can't seem to get over how much that hurt. 

I keep waking up, three months later, forgetting that we've broken up. Then I realize and get emotional. I know that he is what I want. I've known it for a while, I told him and he wanted nothing to do with me. I just feel like a terrible person for everything that happened. I hate myself. I just want him to be happy but I can't seem to move on. I really need help. I have a previous issue with self-mutilation (but I haven't cut in four years).
Any advice for moving on with my life?

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend three months ago after realizing the relationship was one-sided. I still have strong feelings for him and can't seem to move on. I'm struggling with self-hate and self-doubt. I need help moving on with my life.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you were in a really unhealthy relationship and it's amazing that you recognized that and took steps to prioritize yourself. It's okay to take time to grieve the loss of the relationship, but it's also important to focus on your own healing and growth. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings? They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I understand how hard it is to move on from someone you still have strong feelings for. But it's important to remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a relationship. It sounds like your ex was not willing to work on the issues in your relationship, and that's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who will prioritize and respect you. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. Try new things, spend time with friends and family, and prioritize your own well-being. You got this!
3. **u/sadpanda**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of guilt and self-doubt. Remember that you did the best you could with the resources you had at the time, and that's okay. It's not your fault that the relationship didn't work out. You're not a terrible person, and you don't deserve to hate yourself. Try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. You're strong and capable, and you will get through this.
4. **u/anonymous123**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like you're really hurting right now. I want to remind you that you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Have you considered talking to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling? Sometimes just sharing your emotions with someone who cares about you can help you feel a little better. You're not alone, and you don't have to go through this by yourself.
5. **u/throwaway456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of guilt and self-doubt. Remember that you did the best you could with the resources you had at the time, and that's okay. It's not your fault that the relationship didn't work out. You're not a terrible person, and you don't deserve to hate yourself. Try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. You're strong and capable, and you will get through this. Also, have you considered taking up a new hobby or activity to distract yourself from your emotions? Sometimes doing something you enjoy can help take your mind off things and give you a sense of purpose. Just a thought!

TITLE: Me [23M] with my GF [21F] 10 months distance relationship, need your point of view of this breakup

POST: Hey. I and my GF have been together for around 1 months. The probem is the distance between us, and we will have the distance between us for another 10-15 months(minimum) so it is really hard and annoying. The problems I am facing is, she is so deep in love with me, it hurts to see her in pain because of the distance, I have a lot of problems at home right now so can't really visit her or vice versa, but we tak around once a week now. We used to talk around 5-10 times a week before, but it is not possible due to my problems at home. She has asked for a pause before because she was have been in pain for so long, I said that we will fix it. Time has passed since then, and I have realised that my problems at might be for another 3 months at least. My thought was to break u, so she can be free from the pain I have caused, but when I talked with her about it I realised that she will be in more pain if I break up. But somewhere deep inside me I know it will be better to let her go, she might be in deeper pain for a month or so, but it will slowly get better. Instead of being with me in pain everyday, until we can move in together. 
I would really like to have your advice and point of view, am I thinking like an idiot? Am I thinking right? Do you have tips to solve this problem even better than a break up?

TL;DR: Me and my GF have been together for 10 months, but due to distance and my problems at home, we are struggling. She is in deep pain, and I think breaking up might be the best option, but I'm not sure. I want your advice and point of view.

---

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're thinking like an idiot. You're considering breaking up with someone you love because you're having a tough time, and you're worried about causing her pain. But think about it, you're already causing her pain by being apart. If you break up, you'll be causing her even more pain, and for what? So you can avoid feeling guilty for a little while? I think you should work on finding ways to make the distance work, even if it's just talking on the phone or video calls every day. It's not ideal, but it's better than giving up on each other."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're being selfish. You're thinking about your own problems and how they're affecting your relationship, but you're not considering how your girlfriend is feeling. She's already in pain because of the distance, and you're considering breaking up with her because you're not willing to put in the effort to make it work. That's not fair to her. You need to think about what's best for her, not just what's best for you."
* "I think you should try to find a compromise. Maybe you can't visit her as often as you'd like, but you can still make an effort to stay in touch. You could schedule regular video calls or phone calls, and make sure to send her messages or emails throughout the day. It's not the same as being together in person, but it's better than nothing. And who knows, maybe your problems at home will resolve themselves in a few months, and you'll be able to visit her more often. Don't give up on each other just yet."
* "I think you're being too focused on the negative. Yes, the distance is tough, but it's not impossible. You're already talking on the phone or video calls once a week, which is more than some couples can say. You're making an effort to stay in touch, and that's something to be proud of. Instead of focusing on the problems, try to focus on the good things in your relationship. What are some things that you're grateful for? What are some things that you're looking forward to when you're finally together again? Focus on the positive, and try to find ways to make the distance work for you both."

TITLE: Utility Payments that aren't really mine

POST: Good Morning/Afternoon r/advice, 

Never posted on Reddit before at all, but I figured (based on the overall reliability of you nice individuals) that now would be a good time to start. 

About a year ago I moved away from my Midwest town to the west coast for work, and have just recently moved back. I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. 

I am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that. I was alarmed however when  I was told that the value was around $500.00 from a home that I shared with friends in college. They stated that this amount was accrued in 2013.

I have spent the last 3 days trying to find the exact time when we moved from that specific house ( it was college, so we had a new place basically every year) and just now found out that the lease was over on 05/31/2012. Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously "managed" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). 

My question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have? I cannot afford to pay it, but I also don't think that it should be on me TO pay it. Any advice is truly appreciated as I have not had any experience with this type of thing before.

TL;DR: Owing $500 in past utility bills from a college house I shared with friends, but the lease ended in 2012 and I didn't request cancellation. Am I responsible for paying it and what can I do?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* **You're not responsible for paying it**: The utility company should have sent notifications to the new residents or the landlord to transfer the account to their name. Since you didn't request cancellation and the lease ended in 2012, you shouldn't be held responsible for the outstanding balance.
* **Contact the utility company**: Reach out to the utility company and explain the situation. Provide them with the lease end date and any evidence you have to support your claim. They may be willing to work with you to resolve the issue.
* **Check your credit report**: Since the debt is old, it's unlikely to affect your credit score. However, it's still a good idea to check your credit report to ensure the debt is not being reported incorrectly.
* **Consider a payment plan**: If the utility company is unwilling to waive the debt, ask if they can set up a payment plan to help you pay off the balance over time.
* **Don't ignore the issue**: It's essential to address the issue promptly to avoid any potential consequences, such as a collections agency contacting you or reporting the debt to the credit bureaus.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS**

* Keep a record of all communication with the utility company, including dates, times, and details of conversations.
* Consider sending a formal letter to the utility company, outlining your situation and requesting resolution.
* If you're unable to resolve the issue with the utility company, you may want to consider contacting your state's public utility commission or consumer protection agency for assistance.

TITLE: Any hope for the elusive lesbian man? (20 M/MtF)

POST: For most of my life I was pretty hopeless about dating, mostly because I could not be myself when with women; I put on a man act because I was afraid of losing their interest.

I thought I was gay, but the only thing I'm missing is an enjoyment for sex with men.  I've tried it many times and couldn't stay hard.  I was resigned to being a foreveralone with no hope and I was pretty hopeless about life.

I used to joke to myself about being a lesbian in a man's body, but it turns out that's not far from the truth.  I'm going to be transitioning and living as a female in the next 6-12 months with the help of hormones and a lot of work, but I feel like I am unable to form meaningful relationships with women in the mean time.

I don't find straight women that appealing because they prefer, and expect, masculinity from me and assume the submissive role that I would normally take in a relationship.  But while dating a lesbian girl who assumes the dominant role would be perfect, they don't find me attractive now and may lesbians seem to have a militant aversion to trans women.

It seems that either I somehow must act masculine and have women attracted to me (hasn't worked, would rather play in traffic) or I be myself and no one will want me for at least another 1-2 years when I presumably pass as a woman at some level.  How can I make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time?

TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old MtF transitioning in the next 6-12 months, struggling to form meaningful relationships with women due to my current gender presentation and the fact that I'm not attracted to men. I'm looking for advice on how to make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time.

TITLE: Me 26M I haven't met anyone else after my live-in ex two years ago

POST: She was my first serious long term partner and eventually cheated on me.  Our breakup was shitty, and we didn't really remain friends.

It took a while to "get over it" but since then I knew I was ready and open to date someone new.  I really wanted to be in love again and find someone I could share my life with. But in the two years I've been single: I just haven't. 

It sucks, because I see tons of attractive women, I meet lots of interesting people, and I know rationally there are a lot of people out there that would make good matches.  So it doesn't make any sense to me why I haven't been able to meet anyone that I've felt romantic about in longer than I can remember.

At this point I feel like I've kind of resigned myself against the possibility of meeting anyone anytime soon.  I've had FWB's, dated a few people for a while, but just haven't dated anyone that I've felt a romantic connection with.

For the past year, I tried to just not put any pressure on it and just let it happen.  But at the same time, it seems like it's starting to feel like it's been a long time, and at this point I'd really like to love someone.

Anyway, at my current trajectory, I could easily see myself going down this path for the next five or ten years.  I'm not really sure what to do.  I lift weights and am in pretty good shape, but I don't really seem to attract the kind of people I'm attracted to (so basically, attractive women, making me like every other dude).

Anyway, I thought about this because recently my ex friended me on facebook and, while it wasn't a serious thing (she's had a new bf for a while now), I wrote her last week just to catch up and she immediately unfriended me and never replied.  I kind of sat there thinking like "man.  My love life is such shit.  All I have after the last two years is the hope of friendship with a woman who wants nothing to do with me, and I still can't find anyone I'm attracted to to date."

TL;DR: I'm 26M, been single for two years since my live-in ex cheated on me.  I've tried to date, but haven't felt a romantic connection with anyone.  I'm starting to feel like I'll be single forever and I'm not sure what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm not a relationship expert, but I think you might be putting too much pressure on yourself. You're focusing on finding someone who's 'attractive' and'making you like every other dude', but maybe you should try to focus on finding someone who shares your values, interests, and sense of humor. That's what matters in the long run, not physical appearance. Also, have you considered online dating? It can be a great way to meet new people who share your interests."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to take time to heal after a breakup, and it's not uncommon for people to go through a dry spell. Instead of focusing on what you're not getting, try to focus on what you are getting - you're getting to know yourself better, you're getting to prioritize your own needs and desires, and you're getting to figure out what you want in a partner. Also, have you considered taking a break from dating and focusing on yourself for a bit? Sometimes, taking a step back and focusing on our own personal growth can help us become more attractive and confident partners."
3. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you sound like a total mess. You're 26 and you've been single for two years? That's not a 'dry spell', that's a 'I'm not trying hard enough' situation. You need to get out there and start putting yourself out there. Stop focusing on what you're not getting and start focusing on what you can offer. And for the love of god, stop talking about how 'attractive' you are. It's not about how you look, it's about how you make others feel. Get over yourself and start being a better partner to yourself."
4. **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to take time to heal after a breakup, and it's not uncommon for people to go through a dry spell.

**Conclusion:**

The OP is feeling frustrated and hopeless about his love life after a two-year dry spell since his live-in ex cheated on him. He's been trying to date, but hasn't felt a romantic connection with anyone. He's starting to feel like he'll be single forever and is unsure what to do.

The comments offer a range of advice, from focusing on shared values and interests to taking a break from dating and focusing on personal growth. Some commenters are more critical, suggesting that the OP needs to put himself out there more and stop focusing on his physical appearance. Overall, the comments suggest that the OP needs to re-evaluate his approach to dating and focus on building a connection with someone who shares his values and interests.

TITLE: TIFU by renting my apartment to the weedman

POST: Last week I rented 1 out of 2 rooms to my weedman and his girlfriend. It was only supposed to be till the end of September. 

Sunday noon this guys calls me and tells me 
"Hey man, my girlfriend left me. I'm not going to stay at apartment anymore, I want my money back!"

I don't really have backup funds for emergency situations like this due to the fact that I just started working as an apprentice one year ago. My mother pays for the apartment.

Now here is where the fuck up happened. He payed me around 500€ for one month. The rent was already payed and I decided to spent the money on clothes, electronics, booze and of course some herbs. And I also didn't tell my mother about. 

This dude has the key for the main lock to the apartment. Unfortunately this is a universal key. He can open the door to the building, to my mail and the door. Fortunately I didn't give the key for the second lock. 

After trying to tell him that I don't have his money, he went berserk. He threatened me via text and phone calls. 

I panicked. Closed both locks. Went to my parents house, because I didn't really felt safe there anymore. My parents are out of town till the end of September and I beg to God that I can sort this situation out. 

My mother will probably kill me if she finds out, the dealer most likely too. Drugs are bad mkay kids?

TL;DR: I rented a room to a weedman and his girlfriend, spent the rent money on personal stuff, and now the weedman is threatening me because I don't have his money back. I'm in a bad situation and I don't know what to do.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (That's It, F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) made a series of poor decisions, including:

1. Renting a room to a questionable individual (a weedman) without doing proper background checks.
2. Spending the rent money on personal items instead of saving it for emergencies.
3. Not telling their mother about the rental agreement or the money they spent.
4. Panicking and closing the locks when the weedman became aggressive, which may have escalated the situation.

The OP is now in a difficult situation, with a angry tenant who has access to the apartment and a mother who may be upset when she finds out what happened. The post is a cautionary tale about the importance of responsible decision-making and planning for emergencies.

TITLE: TIFU by standing up to the school jerk.

POST: I am a college student in a very small Institute. (Graduation class of less than 50) Well there is this particular guy who is the biggest jerk of the school. He has to "one up" everybody and is constantly demeaning and disrespectful. 

Well, this particular discussion began over the recent tragedy involving Robin Williams death.

He had mentioned the incident and said that those who take their own lives are "Shameless Cowards" and those people shouldn't waste time on Earth if they can't handle life. Also the families and loved ones of those individuals should be ashamed and embarrassed.

I then was very upset and told him that I have had people very close to me take their own lives, and You can imagine what that person must have been dealing with. He proceeded to say they were simply weak. At this point I went off and can't remember everything that was said. Well a nosey student went and told a director that I was Verbally assaulting an innocent student. (of course) this student was an underclassmen who did not know the situation nor the history of this person. They also lied and exaggerated the story.

I was called into a meeting where I was suspended for the next 3 days. Upon my return on Monday I have a meeting with the program Director to discuss further repercussions, aka Expulsion from a College I have paid to go to. 

This college is a joke. The teachers act like high school students and gossip like no teenage I've ever met. the favoritism and exaggeration is outrageous. I am being threatened with expulsion on the false grounds of bulling with no proof of the entire incident and the guy that was involved didn't even come forward to complain about it because it was simply a heated discussion in which were both involved.

I guess the lesson here is, You can't stand up to Bullies because you look like a bully and then are kicked from a bullshit college that you have paid $30,000 to attend.

TL;DR: I stood up to a school jerk who made a comment about people who take their own lives being "Shameless Cowards". He said I was weak and I lost my temper. I was suspended for 3 days and now I'm facing expulsion. The college is a joke and I'm being threatened with expulsion on false grounds.

**Comments:**

* "You stood up to a bully and got suspended? That's not a bad thing, that's a good thing. You showed that you won't tolerate disrespect and that you're willing to stand up for yourself and others."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's ridiculous that you're being threatened with expulsion for standing up to a bully. You should be commended for your bravery."
* "I'm a huge fan of this. You told the bully to shut up and he got mad. That's what we need more of in this world. People standing up to bullies and telling them to stop their crap."
* "I'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself and others. You're not a bully, you're a hero. Don't let the college take away your education because of a false accusation."
* "This is a great example of how not to handle a situation. You should have just walked away and ignored the bully instead of engaging with him. Now you're facing expulsion and it's all because of your own actions."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's ridiculous that you're being punished for standing up to a bully. You should be rewarded for your bravery."
* "I think you should take a stand and fight this. You didn't do anything wrong and you shouldn't be punished for it. You should be proud of yourself for standing up to the bully and not backing down."
* "I'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself and others. You're a true hero and you should be commended for your bravery. Don't let the college take away your education because of a false accusation."

TITLE: Me[19M] with my Girlfriend [19F] of 3 years, She is unsure if our relationship is worth saving - Help

POST: Hey guys,

me and my girlfriend had been together for about 1 year when i started to ignore her problems and be a bit selfish, denying that we had problems and letting my own insecurities out on our relationship.
This carried on for another year and she put up with it.

at the moment we currently aren't together and she kind of likes another guy, goes out with him and hang around together, she says that she still loves me and wants me to show her that we're worth saving but i really don't know what to do.
(I'm quite emotionally naive with these kind of things)

At the moment i really don't know what i should do, if i should fight for our relationship and show her that we're worth saving, or just move on with my life without her.
I'm pretty much at rock bottom at the moment

She is literally my whole world and has been for the past 3 years

Please help Reddit

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 3 years have been having problems, she's unsure if our relationship is worth saving, and I'm unsure what to do. She's still in love with me but likes another guy and goes out with him. Should I fight for our relationship or move on?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, it sounds like you've been a bit of a jerk to your girlfriend and now you're wondering why she's unsure about the relationship. You need to take responsibility for your actions and apologize sincerely. If she's still willing to work on things, great. But if not, maybe it's time to move on.
2. **relationshipadvice**: OP, it's great that you're willing to listen to your girlfriend's concerns and work on your relationship. However, it sounds like you've been ignoring her problems for a while now. You need to make a genuine effort to listen to her and understand her feelings. If you're not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate whether this relationship is truly worth saving.
3. **skeptical_sam**: OP, I'm not sure why you're so surprised that your girlfriend is unsure about the relationship. You've been ignoring her problems and being selfish for a while now. It's not like she's been perfect either, but it sounds like you've been more focused on your own insecurities than on working on your relationship. Maybe take some time to reflect on your own actions and see if you can make some changes.
4. **heartbroken_hope**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling to know what to do. I would say that it's worth having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's unsure about the relationship because she feels like you're not willing to work on things together. Maybe try to have a calm and respectful conversation about what you both want and see if you can find a way forward.
5. **cynical_cindy**: OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it sounds like you've been a bit of a jerk to your girlfriend and now you're wondering why she's unsure about the relationship. You need to take responsibility for your actions and apologize sincerely. If she's still willing to work on things, great. But if not, maybe it's time to move on and find someone who will appreciate you for who you are.

TITLE: Does debit card insufficient funds fee affect my credit in any way?

POST: First time posting on Reddit and on mobile, formatting might be a problem.
Yesterday, I checked my bank account online after my card was not accepted for a payment. Turns out I have a balance of -$60 on my debit card because of a purchase done on a subscription I didn't even know I had subscribed to. I only had 0.23¢ (irresponsible, I know) on my bank account, and the subscription costed $12. So apart from the $12 fee, I got an overdraft fee of -$34, and another more for -$15 after not paying the first fee a week after I got it. So now I have a $60 fee, and I have no idea if it will affect my credit or my debit in any way. I do not have a credit card, I have never had any, and I plan to pay the debt today. Will this fee affect me and my credit in any way?

TL;DR: I got a debit card insufficient funds fee of $60, and I'm worried if it will affect my credit or debit in any way. I plan to pay it today.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey, don't worry about it! Debit card fees don't affect your credit score. It's just a debit card issue, and you'll be fine. Pay it off and move on!"
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I agree with throwaway123456. Debit card fees are separate from credit scores. However, it's still important to keep an eye on your account and make sure you're not consistently overdrafting. You might want to consider setting up overdraft protection or a budget to avoid this in the future."
3. **u/creditwhiz**: "Just to clarify, debit card fees don't directly affect your credit score. However, if you're consistently overdrafting and not paying off your debts, it can negatively impact your credit utilization ratio. Make sure to pay off your debt and set up a budget to avoid this in the future."
4. **u/financiallyfree**: "I would recommend setting up a budget and tracking your expenses to avoid this in the future. It's also a good idea to review your bank statements regularly to catch any suspicious transactions. And, of course, pay off your debt as soon as possible."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "Yeah, and don't forget to cancel that subscription you didn't know you had! You can also consider setting up automatic payments for your bills to avoid any future overdrafts."

**TL;DR:** The comments agree that debit card fees do not directly affect your credit score, but it's still important to keep an eye on your account and make sure you're not consistently overdrafting. It's also recommended to set up a budget, track your expenses, and pay off your debt as soon as possible. Cancel any unwanted subscriptions and consider setting up automatic payments for your bills.

TITLE: Can I legally shut down someone's social media accounts if it is giving me a bad rep?

POST: My first and last name is pretty unique. I only get about ~500 page results when I Google my name. Recently, some idiot who apparently has the same full name as me (i have no idea who he is) opened up twitter and facebook accounts under his name so that when I search for my name on Google, the first page contains links to all of his accounts, which have the same name as me. Now, I usually would have no problem with this. The problem that I have is that (1) all of his posts talk about him doing drugs, smoking weed, drinking, partying (2) he has pornography all over his social media accounts (3) several pornographic websites of his account appear. (4) he says a lot of racist stuff that I don't agree with (5) and every other word is a curse word. I'm completely the opposite of this, and this obviously does not give me a good name considering that I'm in my second year of university and am starting to look for jobs soon. I'm worried employers would see it and automatically reject me.  Can I sue him for defamation? I've tried reporting the accounts, but I failed because twitter and facebook say that  I do not have rights to take down his account. Is there anything that I can do?

TL;DR: Someone with the same name as me is posting explicit content, racist comments, and using curse words on social media. This is giving me a bad rep and I'm worried it will affect my job prospects. Can I legally shut down his accounts or sue him for defamation?

ANSWERS:

* You can't sue him for defamation because the content on his social media accounts is not about you, but rather about him. Defamation requires that the false statement be about the plaintiff (you) and cause harm to their reputation.
* You can't shut down his social media accounts because you don't have the legal right to do so. Social media platforms have their own terms of service and community guidelines, and they are responsible for enforcing those guidelines. If you report the accounts, they will review the content and take action if it violates their guidelines.
* You can try to contact the social media platforms and explain the situation to them. They may be willing to work with you to resolve the issue, such as by changing the username or removing the offensive content.
* You can also try to contact the individual and ask him to stop posting the offensive content. If he refuses, you may want to consider reporting him to the authorities or seeking legal advice.
* It's also worth noting that you may want to consider changing your username or profile name on social media to make it easier for people to distinguish between you and the other person with the same name.

It's important to remember that the internet is a public space, and people have the right to express themselves, even if you don't agree with what they're saying. However, you also have the right to protect your reputation and take steps to address any harm that may be caused by the other person's actions. It may be helpful to speak with a lawyer or other legal expert to get more specific advice on how to handle this situation.

TITLE: I (20F) was a horrible person in a relationship because of my past

POST: My boyfriend (19M)  broke up with me (20F), after an 8 month relationship, a little over a month ago. The break up was bad. I was hysterical and acted like a child. At first I did not know why he had broken up with me (his answers to my questions were not very clear). 

After a while, and a little soul searching, I realized that out relationship fell apart because of my need to be in control. I was constantly nagging him to do things and I constantly micro-managed not only my life, but also his. 

I have been going to counseling ever since the break up. It has made me realize that my behavior comes from a controlling parent. I do not want to be controlling and am working on living life without worry about something not going right. So far, I am actually enjoying my life more than I have in a very long time.

I had not thought about my ex for quite a while. About a week after the break up I decided that it was time for me to pull my life back together. Now that I am feeling much better, I have started thinking about him again. I would like to try again in a relationship with him. I am sure he is angry and hurt by the way I treated him. I do not want to have the same relationship we had because if it did not work once, it is not going to work again. I could go give him  the whole "I've changed" speech, but I feel like I need to say something different than that. I do not know what to do to try and win him back, and let him know I actually want to have a good, healthy relationship.

TL;DR: I was a controlling partner in my 8 month relationship and it ended. I've been in counseling and have been working on changing my behavior. I want to try again with my ex, but I don't know how to approach him and let him know I've changed.

**Comments:**

* "Wow, it takes a lot of courage to admit your mistakes and take responsibility for them. It's great that you're working on yourself and recognizing the patterns that led to the break up. If you do decide to reach out to your ex, be honest with him about your past behavior and how you've been working to change. Don't apologize for who you were, but rather for how you treated him. Good luck!"
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to work on yourself and become a better partner. However, I would caution you against reaching out to your ex too quickly. Give him space and time to process his emotions and reflect on the relationship. When you do reach out, be genuine and authentic in your approach. Don't try to 'win him back' or 'fix' the past, but rather focus on building a new connection based on mutual respect and trust."
* "I think it's amazing that you're taking responsibility for your actions and working to change. However, I would also caution you against expecting your ex to take you back just because you've changed. You need to focus on building a new relationship with someone who respects and values you for who you are, not just because you've 'fixed' your past mistakes. Good luck on your journey of self-improvement and growth!"

TITLE: Invited to go out, but I have major anxiety...

POST: My friends finally decided to invite me out for a night out, I usually hang out with this group but the only thing is that they're all planning to sleep over at someones house who I'm not to familiar with. They're all close to these people living in the house, but I would feel extremely uncomfortable staying there. I'm not even sure if he's okay with it, my friends just told me that they were going too.
I don't have anywhere else to stay because we're going to a different city (college campus), I want to go out with them, but I'm not sure. I'm hyperventilating just thinking about it...

TL;DR: Friends invited me out, but they're planning to sleep over at someone's house I'm not familiar with, and I'm really anxious about it.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* "Hey, it's totally okay to say no to something that makes you uncomfortable. You can always suggest an alternative, like meeting up for dinner or something instead of sleeping over."
* "I would talk to your friends about your concerns. They might not have realized how uncomfortable you'd feel and they might be willing to make other arrangements."
* "You could also try to find out more about the person's house and the people living there. Sometimes knowing more about the situation can help alleviate anxiety."
* "Remember that your friends care about you and want you to feel comfortable. If you're feeling anxious, it's okay to express that and they'll likely work with you to find a solution."
* "If you do decide to go, try to focus on the present moment and what you're doing, rather than worrying about the future or what might happen. You got this!"
* "It's also okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. If you're really feeling anxious, it might be better to stay in a hotel or find another accommodation that makes you feel more at ease."
* "You're not alone in feeling anxious about social situations. It's totally normal and there are people who understand what you're going through. Remember that you're strong and capable, and you can get through this!"

TITLE: I've lost weight, but I want to tone up and start eating healthy. Before after pics included.

POST: I went from 195 to around 150. 

BACKGROUND: I very recently started working out, but dieting is where I fail. I eat real bad, yesterday for example I had 2 bags of chips, 15ish Hershey kisses, an ice cream sandwich, pizza, and fried chicken. That was a pretty average day,  I've done 2 pints of ice cream no problem, but now I'm trying to slow down on my sugar intake. I don't calorie count. 

Eating right seems to focus on creating healthy yet delicious meals. But that's not me, the tastiness doesn't outweigh the time spent making. I just want to get what I need. Hence why I eat so much fast food and junk. Need x amount of carbs? Drink this it takes no time prepping. Need x amount of protein? Take this pill and you're good for the day. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to take shortcuts, I just don't care for food and the more time needed to make a meal the less likely I'll do it.

TL;DR: I've lost weight, but I want to tone up and start eating healthy. I struggle with dieting and eating healthy meals. I'm looking for advice on how to make healthy meals that are quick and easy.

PHOTOS: Before and after photos are included in the post.

TITLE: Friend put me down as a personal reference for a car loan. What should I do?

POST: Someone I hang out with but that I don't know very well put me down as a personal reference for a car loan, and the dealership (a national chain known for financing people with bad credit) called and left me a voicemail to call them back. I have never had to put down a personal reference for a car loan, and I don't know why they are calling me. What type of information are they looking for? (I am definitely NOT cosigning or anything like that; this was out of the blue.)

For the record, I don't know this friend very well. He tells a lot of tall tales about his family and claims to own a luxury car and a house "back home" in another city but seems to be just barely scraping by here. He also recently started his own business, but I have no idea how well it may or may not be doing financially.

So I guess if I called the car dealership back, I wouldn't have anything good to say about his financial situation. To me, it seems like he has no money, but I don't want to tank his chance at getting a car. Should I call back and lie, call back and tell the truth, or just not call back at all?

TL;DR: Friend put me down as a personal reference for a car loan without asking, and the dealership is calling me. I don't know the friend well and don't know his financial situation. Should I call back and lie, tell the truth, or not call back at all?

---

**Top comments:**

* "Don't call back. You don't owe them anything, and you don't want to get tangled up in someone else's financial mess."
* "Call back and tell them you're not comfortable being a reference for someone you don't know well. You can say something like, 'I'm happy to help a friend out, but I don't know [friend's name] well enough to vouch for their financial situation.'"
* "Don't lie, but don't be too harsh either. You can say something like, 'I'm not familiar with [friend's name]'s financial situation, but I'm sure they'll be able to provide you with more information.'"
* "Block the number. You don't want to deal with this guy's financial drama."
* "Consider having a conversation with your friend about why you're uncomfortable being a reference for them. They might not have realized the implications of putting your name down without asking."

TITLE: He doesn't trust me because he's cheating on me. Duh.

POST: Seriously, I'm an idiot for getting myself into this.

When I fall in love I just automatically give the person the benefit of the doubt, and my trust. Y'know, I thought if you love someone then that automatically means you should be able to trust them. If he tells me he doesn't trust me because he's scared, I'd just believe that shit without a second thought. 

Am I really that much of an idiot to just believe that? This guy is totally fucking around, I can't believe I'd be stupid enough to believe otherwise just because of love and just because *I'm* faithful. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

But now, I'm just going to numb myself out. I'm really good at that. I'm going to constantly assume the worst. I'm going to allow myself to keep falling in love with him (because honestly I couldn't stop myself if I tried) and I'm going to stay just as faithful as I've been this entire time, *but I'm not trusting him for shit*. Fuck that.

I already know what's coming. I've probably been getting played since the beginning, and I'm definitely being played now. I'd be a fucking idiot to think this guy actually loves me. 

I mean really, why did I think I was special? What made me think I was so special that he would want to be with me exclusively? I only believed it because that's what I wanted, but what the fuck? Could I be a bigger fucking idiot? Damn.

I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. Sooner or later it'll get more obvious that I'm being used and I'll be discarded, or the betraying will become apparent. Whatever comes first. So at least for now I can love him without being fully aware of how I'm being fucked.

It'll actually be cool to get my heart broken because then I can really numb out. Any faith I have in people would be sucked out and replaced with cold detachment. I'll shut people out of my heart in the name of defense. If I don't trust anyone to begin with, then they would have no chance to fuck me over. Awesome.

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with someone who's cheating on me, and he doesn't trust me because of it. I'm realizing I'm an idiot for trusting him in the first place, and I'm just going to numb myself out and enjoy the ride while it lasts.

EDITS:

* Added a few more sentences to clarify the situation
* Changed the title to better reflect the content of the post
* Added a TL;DR for easier reading

This post is a great example of how people can rationalize their own poor choices and behaviors. The author is aware that their partner is cheating on them, but they're choosing to ignore it and instead focus on their own perceived flaws and shortcomings. They're using their own lack of self-trust as a way to justify their partner's infidelity, rather than confronting the reality of the situation.

The post also highlights the dangers of people-pleasing and the importance of setting boundaries. The author is so desperate to be loved and accepted that they're willing to overlook their partner's obvious flaws and infidelity. This can lead to a cycle of abuse and exploitation, where the partner takes advantage of the author's willingness to forgive and forget.

Overall, this post is a great example of how people can get caught up in toxic relationships and how important it is to prioritize self-care and self-respect. It's a reminder that we deserve to be treated with respect and honesty, and that we should never settle for anything less.

TITLE: Me [27F] my long term boyfriend [30 M) of 2 years lied about using dating sites.

POST: I recently discovered my boyfriend of over 2 years has been logging onto a dating site daily. We had spoken before about this account a few months into our relationship and agreed that as long as it wasnt being used there was no reason to deactivate it. 

A year later i logged into mine to  look at a friends potential date, and saw he was online. I went back the next day and there he was again. Over the next few weeks i checked in daily and he was online up to 3 times a day. I mentioned I saw him on there and he lied to me, saying it was once off answering a friend. He got angry that I brought it up and accused me of being paranoid and untrusting, and that he would have to shut it down because of my issues and i securities.
 I havent told him yet that I know he lied, Im trying to come to terms with his response and not blow up. I genuinly dont believe he is cheating on me, but the fact he is browsing other women, and choosing to lie to me and put me down instead of admit it is a huge red flag, and not in line with the love he claims to have for me. I feel disrespected and upset that my relationship is not based on honesty like I thought. I have just left a job to move across the country to be with him, and now Im unsure about my decision. He knows honesty is non negotiable with me, this has seriously damaged my idea of our relationship.
Any advise or insights?
*Ive never been insecure or untrusting in relationships. Wondering If Im picking up on something this time round?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 2 years has been using a dating site daily, lied about it, and got defensive when I confronted him. I'm unsure what to do and feel disrespected and upset.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not just about the dating site. It's about the fact that he lied to you and got defensive when confronted. That's a huge red flag. You deserve someone who will be honest with you and respect your feelings."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I would tell him how you feel and what you've discovered. It's better to be honest and open about your concerns than to let it simmer and potentially blow up in the future. Remember, honesty is a two-way street."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being too understanding. He lied to you and disrespected you. You deserve better than that. I would take some time to think about whether this relationship is truly healthy for you."
4. **u/relationship_advisor**: "It's great that you're taking the time to process your feelings before confronting him. However, it's essential to remember that you can't change him, but you can change how you react to the situation. Consider having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns."
5. **u/anonymous_user**: "I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's not just about the dating site. It's about the lack of trust and respect in the relationship. You deserve someone who will prioritize your feelings and be honest with you. Take some time to think about whether this relationship is truly right for you."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP's boyfriend lied about using a dating site, which is a significant red flag.
* The OP feels disrespected and upset by the situation, and is unsure what to do.
* Commenters advise the OP to be honest and open about their concerns, take time to process their feelings, and consider whether the relationship is truly healthy for them.

TITLE: I [M24] have been dating F[20] over summer and don't want to continue seeing her romantically. She is very attached to me. How can I let her down easy?

POST: I've been seeing a girl over the summer. Shes really sweet but has been giving hints she wants to make our relationship official.  I've given it some thought and I decided I don't want to take it to that level with her.  Like I said, she is really nice, but we're in different places in life and I just have a gut feeling that I don't want to take it any further.  She has gotten really attached to me though and I know this is going to crush her.  She also lost one of her parents recently which makes the whole situation worse.  I've been in a shitty place too so we've been really helping each other emotionally.  So some part of me really doesn't want to do this since I'll be more emotionally isolated, as well as her.  I would love to keep things casual, but I don't think that would be healthy for her since I'm afraid she would say yes with the hope I would change my mind.

How can I let her down easy, or as much as possible given the situation?  Is it possible for us to still be there for each other after the dust settles?

TL;DR: I've been dating a girl over summer, but don't want to take it further. She's very attached and has been through a tough time with the loss of her parent. I want to let her down easy, but also don't want to lead her on. How can I do this and still be there for her after the breakup?

TITLE: Reddit, need help against my Catholic ex-roommate

POST: Reddit,
I moved in with a good friend of mine in November of last year. Before moving in with me he knew I was gay. However in February he told me that he became very religious (joined Knights of Columbus) and could no longer live with me. He asked me to 'control myself' until November at lease end or he would have to move out. 

I never had anyone over while he was at the residence and you would never know I was gay unless I told you. This all started because I had a straight friend over and the entire time he 'freaked out' thinking of what I might be doing with him. I was so furious at the time I told him to just move out.

He moved out, I could not find another roommate so we were forced to give notice to the leasing office we would be leaving. He continued to pay bills, rent, etc. 

Here is my problem, there is a $1000 dollar cancellation fee, he is to pay half and I have to pay half. I think it's ridiculous though because he is the one that broke the lease contract on his own accord based on his views, I did not want too. My attorney says the same and says the state will agree with me in small claims court. He sent my roommate a letter stating that he must pay or we will pursue civil law suit action. However no results. 

My attorney is suggesting I send him a letter basically saying 'If you are a true Catholic as you say then you will pay him the money because it's the right thing to do. He suggested I quote some excerpts from the bible. I'm not religious so I'm not too versed on what excerpts I could pull out. 

I would appreciated any help you guys could give me!

TL;DR: Ex-roommate broke lease contract due to his religious beliefs, now I'm stuck with a $1000 cancellation fee and he won't pay up. Need help with a letter to persuade him to pay up.

---

**Reddit's Response:**

The post received a mixed response from the Reddit community, with some users expressing sympathy for the OP and others taking a more neutral or even critical stance. Here are some notable comments:

* "I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like your roommate is trying to take advantage of you. You should focus on getting a fair settlement through small claims court rather than trying to guilt trip him into paying up." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I understand where you're coming from, but using the Bible to guilt trip him into paying up is not the right approach. It's not about being a 'true Catholic,' it's about being a responsible roommate. Try to focus on the facts of the situation and the lease agreement instead of making personal attacks." (u/neutralobserver)
* "I'm a Catholic, and I think your roommate's behavior is unacceptable. You're right to stand up for yourself and seek a fair resolution. Good luck in small claims court!" (u/CatholicGuy123)
* "I'm not sure why you're getting so worked up about this. It's just a $1000 fee. Maybe you should just pay it and move on with your life." (u/calm_down)

The post also received some suggestions for biblical passages that could be used to persuade the roommate to pay up, including:

* "The Bible says 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.' If your roommate is unwilling to pay up, it's because he's not showing love and respect for you as his neighbor." (u/BibleThumper)
* "The Bible says 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' If you were in your roommate's shoes, wouldn't you want him to pay up and be a responsible roommate?" (u/ChristianValues)

Overall, the Reddit community was divided on the issue, with some users taking a more sympathetic approach and others offering more neutral or critical advice. The post also sparked a discussion about the role of religion in personal relationships and the importance of being a responsible roommate.
