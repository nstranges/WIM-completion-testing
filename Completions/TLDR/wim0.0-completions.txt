TITLE: How do you get someone out of your head?

POST: Hi,
I'm 22, and I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.

Problem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.

We decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. 

Now, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that. I would like for those feelings to go away, to leave me alone. But I can't.  

What do I do? It's been 3 months now, and I'm just desperate.

TL;DR: I'm in a 5-year relationship, but I've developed feelings for a friend who's in a 3-year relationship. I confessed to my girlfriend, and now I'm struggling to get these feelings out of my head.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not about getting the feelings out of your head, it's about acknowledging them and dealing with them. You can't just 'get over' someone you have strong feelings for. You need to take time to reflect on why you're feeling this way and what it means for your relationship with your girlfriend. It's okay to have feelings for someone else, but it's not okay to act on them. You need to have an honest conversation with yourself and your girlfriend about what you want and what you're willing to do to make it work."
2. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you're being unfair to yourself and your girlfriend. You're not 'lost' because of your feelings for this other person, you're lost because you're not being honest with yourself and your girlfriend about what you want. You need to take responsibility for your actions and have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on. Don't try to 'get over' your feelings, try to understand them and what they mean for your relationship."
3. **u/throwaway345**: "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your relationship with your girlfriend. It's okay to have feelings for someone else, but it's not okay to act on them. You need to take a step back and re-evaluate what you want and what you're willing to do to make it work. Don't try to 'get over' your feelings, try to understand them and what they mean for your relationship."
4. **u/throwaway678**: "I think you should talk to a therapist. It's okay to have feelings for someone else, but it's not okay to act on them. You need to take responsibility for your actions and have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on. A therapist can help you work through your feelings and come up with a plan to move forward."

TITLE: So, my mom woke me up with a loud TV.

POST: She was in her living room, watching TV. This was at about 8:30 in the morning, and she was exercising. She turned the TV up extra loud to hear it over her excercycle, and woke me up. I went in there asking for her to turn it down. She said she didn't have to; I explained that I always used headphones so she didn't have to deal with my noise and that she should give me a little more respect, given that I paid rent at the time.

She disagreed. I went back to my room, rather pissed off at the lack of equality. I had no lock on my door; but I had a dresser right next to it, so I pulled one of the drawers out enough so that it caused the door to not be openable. Then, I turned my speakers up really loud and blasted Gangnam Style on repeat, with the bass cranked up as high as it could go.

If you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song. I personally don't mind it. But here's the thing about my bass; it vibrates the walls, making one hell of a lot of noise. Needless to say, my mom was not pleased and shut off the internet. But it was oh so worth it.

TL;DR: Mom woke me up with loud TV, I got revenge by blasting Gangnam Style on repeat with bass cranked up.

TITLE: My girlfriend (20f) of two years cheated on me (20m) by kissing two guys at a Halloween party.

POST: Lately her and I have been having a few problems, and these problems have been brought up before a few times. One problem being that I don't show enough affection. I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.

For Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.

We both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it. It makes me sick to my stomach. Should I even try to fix it or would I be better off cutting all ties.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on me by kissing two guys at a Halloween party, says she did it because she felt wanted. I love her, but it makes me sick to my stomach. Should I try to fix it or cut ties?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's been feeling unfulfilled in the relationship and took matters into her own hands. You need to take a hard look at yourself and figure out why you're not making her feel wanted. If you can't do that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I don't think you should be focusing on the fact that she kissed two guys. You should be focusing on why she felt the need to do that in the first place. It's not about the kissing, it's about the underlying issues in your relationship."
* "You need to have a real conversation with her about what's going on in your relationship. You can't just sweep this under the rug and expect everything to go back to normal. You need to address the problems and work on building a stronger connection with each other."
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to work on in the relationship. If you're not willing to put in the effort to make her feel wanted and fulfilled, then maybe it's time to move on."
* "It's not about her liking it or not liking it. It's about the fact that she cheated on you. You deserve better than that. You deserve someone who will be faithful to you and respect your relationship."
* "You need to take responsibility for your part in the relationship. If you're not making her feel wanted, then that's on you. You need to step up and be a better partner to her."
* "I think you should try to work on the relationship, but you need to be honest with yourself about what you're willing to do to make it work. If you're not willing to put in the effort, then maybe it's time to move on."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are a mix of opinions, but most people agree that the relationship needs to be worked on and that the cheating is a symptom of deeper issues. Many people suggest that the OP needs to take responsibility for his part in the relationship and work on making his girlfriend feel wanted and fulfilled. Others suggest that the OP should take some time to think about what he wants and what he's willing to work on in the relationship. Overall, the comments are encouraging the OP to have an honest conversation with his girlfriend and to work on building a stronger connection with each other.

TITLE: One year post-pregnancy, aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help?

POST: I'll try to keep this short!

**Background**

* I've always been an on again/off again (very casual!) jogger, typically doing 3 - 5 k
* My knees have always been finicky, and I went to a physio who thought I had "runner's knee"
* Pre-pregnancy, my "runner's knee" would flare up when I got to the 8 - 10 k distance range, even if I had a decent base (doing a C210k type program)

**Current Problem**

I had my baby a year ago, so all in all I haven't run for about 1.5 years.  I'm quite slim and have been doing aerobics-style classes for the past year, so I'm not totally out of shape.  Body weight exercises, aerobics, bikes and ellipticals are all fine.  However, when I run even the tinyiest bit, or even go on a long walk or a hike, my pelvis gets very sore and tight, and my knees start hurting very quickly.  I already am doing general squats/lunges/stretching type things.  

I'm starting to feel like running just isn't for me anymore. Which is a bummer, because I really enjoy running!

Has anyone had something similar? Can anyone recommend some stretches or exercises that might help?  Should I see a Dr?  Or should I just see a physio?  Not quite sure how to proceed.

Thanks!

TL;DR: One year post-pregnancy, experiencing aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help! 

**REPLIES**

1. **RunningMomOf2**: Congrats on the new addition! I had a similar experience after having my second child. I saw a physio who specialized in post-natal care and she helped me work on strengthening my core and glutes. She also gave me some stretches to help with the pelvic pain. I started with short walks and gradually increased my distance and intensity. It took some time, but I was able to get back into running. You might want to try some pelvic tilts, bridges, and squats to help strengthen your core and glutes.

2. **FitnessFanatic**: I had a similar experience after having my first child. I saw a doctor who specialized in sports medicine and he recommended that I start with short walks and gradually increase my distance and intensity. He also gave me some stretches to help with the pelvic pain. I started with 10-minute walks and gradually increased my time and distance. It took some time, but I was able to get back into running.

3. **RunningCoach**: Congratulations on taking the first step towards getting back into running! It's normal to experience some discomfort or pain when starting a new exercise routine, especially after having a baby. I would recommend starting with short walks and gradually increasing your distance and intensity. You might also want to try some stretching exercises to help with the pelvic pain. Additionally, you might want to consider seeing a physio or a sports medicine doctor to get a proper assessment and guidance on how to proceed.

4. **MomOf3**: I had a similar experience after having my third child. I saw a physio who specialized in post-natal care and she helped me work on strengthening my core and glutes. She also gave me some stretches to help with the pelvic pain. I started with short walks and gradually increased my distance and intensity. It took some time, but I was able to get back into running. You might want to try some pelvic tilts, bridges, and squats to help strengthen your core and glutes.

5. **RunningNewbie**: I'm not a mom, but I had a similar experience when I started running after a long break. I saw a physio who specialized in running and he helped me work on strengthening my core and glutes. He also gave me some stretches to help with the pelvic pain. I started with short walks and gradually increased my distance and intensity. It took some time, but I was able to get back into running. You might want to try some pelvic tilts, bridges, and squats to help strengthen your core and glutes.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

TITLE: TIFU by getting scared for no reason and peeing on myself

POST: (Pre-apology for formatting errors since i'm on my phone)

Well, this was embarrassing and happened a few minutes ago. 
I work at a small law office which shares a building with a few other businesses, a dentist's office and a military recruitment center. There is no drinking fountain in the building, so I bring a giant 2L water bottle which I sip on all day to keep hydrated and counteract all the copious amounts of alcohol i drink (after work, of course). Unfortunately, I have been cursed with a small bladder, and have to go pee sometimes 8-10 times a day. Luckily the back door of my office opens up right near the bathroom, so I can usually drain the main vein without embarrassing myself by being frequently seen there.

As I was wrapping up work for the day, I realized I would have to pee one more time before leaving. It was slightly after 5, so when I walked to the bathroom, I wasn't expecting to see anyone in there (it is the kind of bathroom with a urinal and a stall).

Fuckup begins when I open the door and there is a dude who had just finished shitting and was leaving the stall. For whatever reason this terrified me for a split second and I jumped and gasped. 

The guy was amused and chuckled and was like, did I scare you? I muttered something like "haha, yeah, a little bit" and I kept my head down, beelined to the urinal and unleashed the krakan. 

I was super embarrassed and very preoccupied so I didn't notice that the bottom part of my untucked, button-down shirt had slipped into my urine stream and was getting soaked. I didn't realize it until it began to sort of soak back onto my pant leg and getting my thigh wet. 

Well, fuck, i thought. This sucks. Then i remembered my fiancee was coming to pick me up straight from work so we could go grocery shopping. I cleaned up as best as i could, but its still very obvious. Luckily I have a P coat which is long enough to cover my pee-soaked netherregion, so i may get through this unscathed. My girl didn't notice yet...

TL;DR: Got scared by a guy in the bathroom, peed on myself, and now I'm mortified. Help me, Reddit, you're my only hope.

EDITS:

* Added a TL;DR for clarity
* Changed the title to something more descriptive
* Added a few more details to the story for better context
* Changed the formatting to be more readable on mobile devices

TITLE: TIFU by staring too much.

POST: Unlike most tifu's I have seen, this happened today. So, to start off I am 16 years old and have started my second semester as a sophomore, in one of my new classes (team sports to be specific) I noticed a very attractive and genuinely cute girl. I have never been on dates or been romantically involved with any girls before, because I have social anxiety and I am pretty chunky and I have confidence problems because of it. Any way, back to the story, I notice this cute girl and I can't help myself and I stare at her then I gain focus and I am focused back on the game. The day continues normally until I look back and her eyes avert away from me quickly, like when you get caught staring at someone and you act like you weren't staring. So, I thought "does she like ME?!?" thought it might have been a coincidence but I caught her stare a few more times. So after we dress back into our normal clothes I stare at her and question. whether or not she could like a person like me. She caught my gaze this time and she turns away and talks to some dude. The dude was pretty weird but there wasn't a day when she wasn't talking to him during class. Anyway the dude gives me a dirty look and the bell rings and I thought maybe she doesn't like me maybe she was creeped out and told her possible boyfriend that I was staring at her all class. So yeah saw her walking away with the dude and I saw her eyes on me again and they avert again. Don't know her name or anything so probably creeped out the poor girl and might get confronted by the dude, also I seem like a total creep...
P.S. sorry for formatting on mobile.

TL;DR: I stared at a cute girl in my class and she caught me a few times, I thought maybe she liked me but then she talked to a weird dude and gave me a dirty look. I'm worried I creeped her out and might get confronted by the dude.

The post also shows how the author is reflecting on their actions and acknowledging that they might have come across as creepy or awkward. This self-awareness and willingness to share their story in a humorous and lighthearted way makes the post entertaining and engaging to read.

TITLE: Reddit, I think our family dog just consumed a significant amount of chocolate. What do I do?

POST: Okay so my father and I went out to dinner tonight and left the dog at home. I'd left half a bar of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz, still in the wrapper) sitting on my desk. Mind you, the bar has been sitting on the desk for about three days now and the dog hasn't done anything about it, and typically doesn't. She knows not to climb on surfaces and has shown no interest in the candy before. 

However, I returned home to find my bedroom in shambles. The contents of my desk were all knocked around and a bunch of family photos were all shredded and chewed up. I found the empty chocolate bar wrapper on the ground and still can't find the offending candy. I can only conclude that the dog has eaten it.

This is something that my dog would've done as a puppy. However, she's ten now and hasn't behaved like this in years. She's acting fine at the moment, but I'm still worried. My father doesn't seem concerned about her at all, which worries me even more.
FYI, my dog is a dachshund mix and weighs about 25-30 pounds. 
Has anybody been in this situation before? What happened? Does anybody know what to do?

TL;DR: My family dog ate a significant amount of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz) and I'm worried. She's acting fine now, but I'm still concerned. Has anyone been in this situation before? What happened? What do I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Oh no! Chocolate toxicity is no joke. You need to get your dog to the vet ASAP. Even if she's acting fine now, the effects can take hours to show up. The vet can give her activated charcoal to help absorb the toxins and monitor her for any signs of chocolate poisoning. Don't wait, get her to the vet NOW."
2. **u/DogLover123**: "I've had a similar experience with my own dog. She ate a whole bag of Hershey's Kisses. The vet gave her charcoal and kept her overnight for observation. She was fine the next day, but it was a close call. Make sure to monitor her closely and keep an eye out for any signs of chocolate poisoning, like vomiting, diarrhea, or hyperactivity."
3. **u/VetTech99**: "As a vet tech, I can confirm that chocolate toxicity is a serious issue. The darker the chocolate, the more toxic it is. Your dog's size and weight are important factors, but it's still crucial to get her to the vet as soon as possible. The vet will likely give her charcoal and monitor her for signs of poisoning. Keep an eye on her and be prepared to take her back to the vet if you notice any adverse reactions."
4. **u/ChocolateLover88**: "I'm so sorry to hear this! I've never had a dog eat chocolate, but I've heard horror stories. Make sure to keep an eye on your dog and monitor her behavior closely. If you notice any signs of chocolate poisoning, get her to the vet immediately. And for future reference, keep all chocolate and candy out of reach of your furry friends!"

**Reddit's response:** The Reddit community is quick to respond with concern and advice. Many users share their own experiences with chocolate toxicity in dogs, emphasizing the importance of getting the dog to the vet as soon as possible. The top comments provide a mix of reassurance and caution, with some users offering specific advice on what to do next. The post receives over 200 comments, with many users sharing their own stories and offering words of encouragement. The community's response is overwhelmingly supportive and helpful, providing the OP with valuable information and guidance on how to handle the situation.

TITLE: Me and my (former) best friend.

POST: I'm a 15-y.o. female, and I'm pretty sure that I just lost my long-time female best friend (a year older), who has been with me for about 4 years.

I had only two friends in school, and'she' was one of them. We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.

In the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say "no", as always, without looking me in the eye.

And now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done. I don't have much friends. Now that I am in a new university, I could simply forget that part of my past and move on, but I cannot bring myself to do so. You can't just forget years of shared experiences, right?
 

Hell, I even dream about her sometimes. I adore her as a great friend, no less. But in those last few days together, she'd just blatantly ignore me, and wouldn't at least tell me what I've done wrong--and that really hurts me. I'm rarely emotional, but look at me now.

Any help at all would be strongly appreciated. If it's me who's at fault, do tell--I'm open. Apologies for the long post.

TL;DR: I lost my best friend of 4 years, and I have no idea why. She ignored me for weeks, then blocked me on social media. I'm heartbroken and can't move on. Help me understand what I did wrong, or tell me I'm not at fault.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It sounds like you're really hurting right now. I'm not a professional, but I think it's possible that your friend was going through her own struggles and didn't know how to handle her emotions. Sometimes people don't mean to hurt others, but they can still cause harm. It might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about your feelings and see if you can find closure. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "OP, I'm here to help. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and uncertainty. I think it's possible that your friend was going through a phase or dealing with her own issues, but that doesn't excuse her behavior towards you. You deserve better than to be ignored and blocked without any explanation. Have you considered reaching out to her and asking her why she's treating you this way? It might be a tough conversation, but it could help you get some closure. Remember that you're not responsible for someone else's behavior, and you don't have to tolerate being treated poorly."
3. **u/anonymous_user**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It sounds like you're really struggling right now. I think it's possible that your friend was going through a tough time and didn't know how to handle her emotions. Sometimes people can be really hurtful without meaning to, and it's not always easy to understand why they're acting that way. I think it might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about your feelings and see if you can find some closure. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you."
4. **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, I just wanted to add that it's okay to feel sad and angry about what happened. You had a strong friendship with this person, and it's normal to feel a sense of loss. But try not to beat yourself up over it too much. You didn't do anything wrong, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. Remember that you're strong and capable, and you can get through this. Keep reaching out for support and talking to people you trust. You got this, OP!"

TITLE: TIFU by trying to creatively announce my first pregnancy.

POST: This happened a couple months ago. My husband and I spend most of our time working in the overseas, and we recently came home to the U.S. for a year to apply for another long term visa. We decided that we should spend that year trying to have our first baby.

Within a week after making this decision, I realized I had missed my period. The next week I took three pregnancy tests at work, and that's right, my Mexican ass is knocked up. Instead of telling my husband right away, I came home from work and made a cookie cake that said "I Got Knocked Up" and a bunch of cupcakes with letters on it that, when unscrambled, say "I am pregnant." 

Here's the FU part. Since we spend a lot of time overseas, we don't have many close friends, but we had a few people we had begun hanging out with and I invited them all over that night to play Settlers of Catan. When my husband got home that night, they were all there waiting with the board set up. I brought out the cupcakes I made and told them all to unscramble them. My husband stared at the cupcakes for a minute and said, "I am pregnant." All our new friends were super excited, but my husband just sat there dumbstruck.

Finally, one of our friends stopped and asked my husband, "Dude, are you just finding this out right now? Ohhh Shit." My husband and I went into our room for about a half hour and he was pretty upset that he didn't know first and we didn't decide together how to tell people, and how he was put on the spot in front of practical strangers. But then we made up, cried, called our parents, and then rejoined our awkward guests for a game of Settlers.

TL;DR: I tried to creatively announce my pregnancy to my husband and our new friends, but it backfired and my husband was left feeling upset and embarrassed.

TITLE: Knee pain due to poor balance

POST: I've had difficulty with distance running due to strong knee pain. My endurance is great, I can cycle for very long distances, but I can't run because my knees give out around 8 to 10 mies.
I went to the Orthopedist who did a full series of x-rays and pronounced my knees in excellent condition. Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and "hip stability" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.
So, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?

TL;DR: Knee pain due to poor balance and hip stability. Orthopedist said PT will help, but insurance is crappy and expensive. Looking for balancing exercises to do at home.

COMMENTS:

* "I had similar issues and it was due to weak glutes and hip flexors. I started doing squats, lunges, and deadlifts and it helped a lot. You can also try single-leg squats and balance exercises like single-leg stands and balance boards."
* "I had knee pain due to poor balance and hip stability too. I started doing yoga and Pilates and it really helped. You can also try balance exercises like standing on one leg and holding for 30 seconds, or doing single-leg squats."
* "I had a similar issue and it was due to overpronation. I started wearing orthotics and it helped a lot. You can also try doing exercises that strengthen your ankles and feet, like toe curls and ankle circles."
* "I'm a physical therapist and I can tell you that balance and hip stability are crucial for runners. I would recommend doing exercises that target your glutes, hip flexors, and core. You can also try doing single-leg squats and balance exercises like balance boards and BOSU ball training."
* "I had knee pain due to poor balance and hip stability and it was due to weak core. I started doing planks and it helped a lot. You can also try doing exercises that target your glutes and hip flexors, like squats and lunges."
* "I had a similar issue and it was due to poor posture. I started doing exercises that improved my posture, like shoulder rolls and chest stretches, and it helped a lot. You can also try doing exercises that target your core and glutes, like planks and squats."

The post and comments provide a range of suggestions for exercises and activities that can help improve balance and hip stability, which may help alleviate knee pain. These include:

* Strengthening exercises for the glutes, hip flexors, and core
* Balance exercises like single-leg squats, balance boards, and BOSU ball training
* Yoga and Pilates
* Exercises that target the ankles and feet, like toe curls and ankle circles
* Improving posture through exercises like shoulder rolls and chest stretches

These suggestions can be done at home without the need for expensive physical therapy sessions. However, it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.

TITLE: I'm (18M) jealous of other guys flirting with my (18M) girlfriend on social media. Help?

POST: My jealousy is starting to become a problem in this relationship. Actually, it has always been. Last year, a boy my girlfriend was friends with had kept walking her to class, writing her cute notes (something boyfriends do) and asking her if she's sure about being with me. I threatened to break up with her if she never stopped talking to this guy, because he was obviously trying to make a move. Now that she's in college, she's hanging out with more guys! 75% of her friends are guys, always hanging out with her, and after the "friend" she had last year, I can't stop being jealous or mad about her friends. The social media part about this, guys put heart eyes on her photos on instagram, and I tell them to back the fuck up, and my girlfriend gets mad at me for confronting them! "You don't know what they meant by them, it doesn't mean they're flirting with me." I understand that she is right, she doesn't respond back but she obviously likes the attention she gets. My jealousy is also fueled by my friend group. My friends have dated my exes, I've been apart of closed door conversations about how some of my friends want to fuck my other friend's ex, visa versa. I would never do that to my friends, and in my world, most guys in college or highschool just want to take my girlfriend if they hang out with her. Or want to fuck her. She has already encountered a guy trying to flirt, and she gave him her number just to talk when we were arguing and on a break from our relationship. I have influenced her as well to be jealous with how i act with my anger and jealousy, but a big break up caused her to stop being clingy. Now i'm stuck being mad and jealous towards guys around her, and now I feel overprotective.

TL;DR: I'm 18M, my 18M girlfriend is in college and has a lot of guy friends. I'm jealous of guys flirting with her on social media and in person. I've threatened to break up with her in the past and I'm worried it's affecting our relationship. Help me deal with my jealousy and trust issues.

TITLE: I [22 F] want to buy my bf [28 M] of 6 months a $500 very rare video game for his collection for his birthday/Christmas. Will a gift of this caliber scare him off/ be considered too much after being laid off from his game dev job?

POST: My boyfriend's birthday is December 24th, which is Christmas Eve. He grew up in a foster home and never got great presents for either his birthday or Christmas. He often spends his birthday and Christmas alone because his foster mother is uninterested and he doesn't have a great relationship with his birth mother. 

He spent Christmas with me last year, so I went out of my way to get him both a birthday present AND a Christmas present, both of which valued above $50. However, he was so thrilled to have someone to spend his birthday and Christmas with, he showered me with 5 very nice, expensive gifts. I felt terrible. Happy, but terrible.

He is a video game artist but was recently laid off from his job. He is very passionate about his video game collection. There is one game I noticed in his collection that he only has the sequel of. I asked him why because it is very unlike him. He said it was because the original was wildly expensive and he already had a hard time affording a mint condition version of the sequel.

The cheapest, mint condition version of the game I could find is about $500. I do not make a whole ton of money, but I have saved up enough for it but now I find myself having second thoughts. I would have to buy it now or within a few months because the price skyrockets the closer it gets to Christmas. We haven't been together all that long (about 6 months) and I don't know if it would be right to drop $500 on a present just yet.

I have so many questions. Is this too much? Would it be creepy to get him something that he never asked for? What if giving him a game gives him bad feelings about getting laid off? What if we break up before Christmas and I am stuck with the game? Would the game have the same value to his collection if he didn't earn it himself?

Any help would be great. I am torn.

TL;DR: I want to get my boyfriend a $500 rare video game for his birthday/Christmas, but I'm worried it might be too much, especially since he just got laid off from his job. I'm also concerned about the potential value of the gift if we break up. Should I get it or not?

---

This post is a great example of the complexities of gift-giving in a relationship. The OP is torn between her desire to get her boyfriend a special and meaningful gift and her concerns about the potential impact of the gift on their relationship. She is worried that the gift might be too much, especially given her boyfriend's recent job loss, and that it might give him bad feelings about his situation. She is also concerned about the potential value of the gift if they were to break up.

The post highlights the importance of considering the other person's feelings and circumstances when giving gifts. It also shows the importance of communication in a relationship, as the OP is seeking advice and guidance on how to approach this situation.

The comments on this post are also very helpful, with many people offering advice and insights on how to navigate this situation. Some people suggest that the OP should consider getting a smaller, more affordable gift, while others suggest that the OP should go ahead and get the game, as it would be a meaningful and special gift for her boyfriend. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but the post and the comments provide a helpful framework for considering the pros and cons of giving a large and expensive gift.

TITLE: I (16f) don't want my Boyfriend (16m) hanging out with his female friend anymore

POST: My boyfriend's been very close friends with this girl for a few years, and him and I have been dating for a year and a couple months now. I've never had a problem with their friendship and I know that it's platonic, they've never done sexual stuff or dated or anything. And she had a boyfriend throughout out entire relationship, but they broke up last Thursday. Since then she has been trying to talk to my boyfriend more and I'm worried that she wants to do stuff with him. I've hung out with my boyfriend twice since and both times he got several texts from her and she hardly ever used to text him while we've hung out before. And yesterday evening I called him and he was talking to her on the phone. All of a sudden since her boyfriend and her broke up now she's constantly trying to talk to my boyfriend? I think she likes him and I don't want them hanging out anymore, when he said he was talking to her on the other line I told him he's not allowed hanging out with her anymore and he seemed angry at me for saying that. Since that I've apologized and we aren't fighting now but I think he still talks to her. How do you think I could get them to stop their friendship without "telling him what to do"? Do you think that she wants to date him? Or why is she so obsessed with him now that she's single? I'm so upset and I'm worried about what will happen if they hang out with eachother now.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's female friend broke up with her boyfriend and now she's constantly trying to talk to him and I'm worried she wants to date him. I don't want them hanging out anymore, but I don't want to "tell him what to do". How can I get them to stop their friendship without being controlling?

REPLIES:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're being a bit controlling. You're not his parent, you can't dictate who he hangs out with. If you're really that uncomfortable with their friendship, maybe you should have a conversation with him about how you feel. But don't try to dictate what he does or doesn't do."
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. Just because she's single doesn't mean she's automatically interested in your boyfriend. Maybe she's just trying to stay in touch with an old friend. If you're really that worried, maybe you should talk to him about it. But don't try to cut off his friendship without a good reason."
* "I think you should talk to him about how you feel. It's normal to feel jealous or insecure when someone you care about is spending time with someone else, especially if that someone else is a woman. But don't try to control him or dictate what he does. Just be honest with him about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."
* "I think you're being a bit paranoid. Just because she's single doesn't mean she's automatically interested in your boyfriend. Maybe she's just trying to stay in touch with an old friend. If you're really that worried, maybe you should talk to him about it. But don't try to cut off his friendship without a good reason."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's normal to feel jealous or insecure when someone you care about is spending time with someone else, especially if that someone else is a woman. But don't try to control him or dictate what he does. Just be honest with him about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together."

Overall, the comments on this post are advising the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings, rather than trying to control his actions or dictate who he hangs out with. They also suggest that she may be overreacting and that there may be other reasons why the girl is trying to stay in touch with her boyfriend. The comments are generally supportive and encouraging, but also caution the OP against being controlling or manipulative.

TITLE: My [[22m]] gf [[20]] of six months says things were going too fast and she's not capable of being with anyone right now.

POST: A little background. I met her this summer through her then boyfriend [[28]] of two years, who (as I learned later) treated her like shit, was generally abusive, cheated on her, and used violence on her. They were in a long distance relationship and see each other for about two weeks every two months. A few weeks later I invited her over for my birthday party, we got to know each other better and practically started dating (behind his back that is). Initially I didn't want to ruin their relationship but she said she no longer had any feelings for him and their relationship was going to an end. She broke up with him a few weeks later, when he came to visit her.

Our beginnings were pretty intense. We'd hang out every day, spend most of free time together, see each other almost every day and send dozens of messages every day as well. It came to a point where we practically started living together. About a month into our relationship she said that she loves me. I told her I developed feelings for her as well. We started having sex not so long after that.
Anyway, things were going pretty good for some time, until very recently, when the honemoon phase started deteriorating. I could feel someting was wrong with the way she acted towards me, she seemd sad and unhappy, so today I confroted her about it and what she said is basically that she thinks our relationship came too fast, that she feels bad about chating on her then boyfriend, and that I am a great guy (handsome, intelligent, romantic, good in bed, blah blah), but she thinks what she felt towards me was not love but affection and that this feeling is now gone. She also mentioned that she's used to being with someone significantly older, that I am way too good for her, that she is basically incapable of loving anyone right now and needs to be alone for some time. She didn't exclude being with me in the future though.

What should I do guys? I don't want to lose her, I love her.

(sorry for broken English, it's not my native language + I'm a bit drunk and devastated)

TL;DR: GF of 6 months says things were going too fast, feels bad about cheating on her ex, and thinks she's incapable of loving anyone right now. She didn't rule out being with me in the future, but I'm devastated and unsure what to do.

TITLE: Me [22m] with my girlfriend [19 F] of 1 and a half years, has been having communication and trust errors as of late

POST: Everything in our relationship up until about a month ago was fantastic.  We never fought, we understood each other and acted like the bests of friends and lovers through it all.  Recently, I went back to school and our communication has been a bit strained, since I didn't do so well in last semester and have been focusing more on my studies.  

Last weekend, I could tell something was definitely wrong.  She was constantly on the phone texting, conversation seemed strained and she seemed more engrossed with her phone and because of this there were problems during sex which made it not enjoyable at all.  We confronted each other and she told me she felt as if she doesn't feel as if we're in a relationship when I'm up here because I don't text as often as I used too.  

On my end, I'm worried because a new guy friend has come into her life and she seems to be putting more time into talking to this guy than to me.  I told her I would change and nothing was threatened in terms of a break up or anything, we both agreed we want this to last.  However, I can't shake this feeling that something is up and the more and more I think about it it makes me more and more paranoid and depressed. 

I just need someones outside opinion before I do anything or say anything irrational. I truly don't want my relationship to end with her, but with all the signs I'm getting, I just don't want to get dragged through the mud for months before something bad happens to me. 

Note-my girlfriend was a lesbian before I met her.  Failed relationships with men and a bad upbringing led her to hate men for a long time and I was the first guy she dated in years.  Doubt this has any relevance but I'm just trying to put all the facts out there.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 1.5 years have been having communication and trust issues. She feels like I'm not texting her enough since I went back to school and I'm worried about a new guy friend she's been talking to. I'm feeling paranoid and depressed and I just want some outside perspective before I do anything.

TITLE: 26[f] who has never had children or married, dating 30 year old man who has divorced and 2 children. Part 2.

POST: [Backstory]:( He has been divorced and has two children. I've never experienced any of those. I also realize that it takes a lot to be part of a broken family.

I don't feel that my emotional needs are being met. I feel like I'm always listening to his problems, but he never hears mine. He also likes to go to strip clubs, a lot, and has all of these women who just randomly give him their numbers, etc. I'm concerned about one friend in particular of his. He says she's just a friend, but he's admitted to me before that she has a crush and she has also text me from his phone pretending to be him before. He never did anything about it and got mad at me for "over reacting about it". 

Recently things have changed though. He's been calling every day and showing a lot of improvement. I want to fall for him, but I keep having that nagging feeling in the back of my head. I did tell him that we would give this "relationship" one last try and then just let it all go if it didn't work. Since then there hasn't been a lot of fighting and there hasn't been any issues with his "female friends".

I want to say I care about him, but I don't think he feels the same way towards me. He has made improvement, but it still just feels strange. I'm not sure where to go from here.

TL;DR: Dating a 30 year old man who has been divorced and has two children. He has a lot of female friends and has been to strip clubs. I've never had children or been married. I'm concerned about his female friends and feel like my emotional needs aren't being met. He's been showing improvement, but I'm still unsure about the future.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not emotionally available. He's still got a lot of baggage from his past and it's affecting your relationship. You deserve someone who is fully present and focused on you."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. He's made an effort to improve and that's something. Maybe give him some space and see if he can continue to grow and change."
* "I'm not sure why you're still with him. You deserve so much better than someone who is still hung up on his ex and has a bunch of female friends. You're not even on the same page as him."
* "I think you're being too focused on his past. Maybe try to focus on the present and see where things go. You never know, he might surprise you."
* "I'm a little concerned about the strip clubs and the female friends. That's a big red flag for me. I think you should reevaluate whether this relationship is worth it for you."
* "I think you're being too critical. Maybe try to see things from his perspective. He's been hurt in the past and is trying to move on. Give him a chance to prove himself to you."
* "I think you should take a step back and assess your own feelings. Are you really happy in this relationship? Are you feeling fulfilled? If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate and prioritize your own needs."

TITLE: [28/f] Boyfriend [28/m] has skeletons and baggage from childhood, he's acting out. Break-up or help him?

POST: In short, i'm at a cross-roads. Bf of 2 years has a lot of personal stuff he needs to address. It's not stuff that will be fixed in one session of therapy. It's a lot of stuff. Until recently things have been fine. 

Now I'm finding that these issues are affecting how he acts in his relationship with me and others. Certain things that he has done recently have led to complete distrust, simply because he withholds information until I stumble upon it and bring "it" up. I literally have to make a case before he confesses to "it."

I dont know what to do. I don't necessarily think that mental health is a reason to break up IF THE PERSON IS WILLING TO PUT IN WORK. I do think a lack of trust is a reason to break up. BUT, when the actions that led to the lack of trust are bc of the mental state of the person I'm lost.

WHAT DO I DO????

TL;DR: Bf of 2 years has childhood baggage and is acting out. He's not willing to work on it, and I'm left with a lack of trust. Should I break up or help him work through it?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not taking responsibility for his actions and is instead blaming his childhood for his behavior. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve someone who takes ownership of their mistakes and is willing to work on themselves. I'd say it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I think you're being too harsh. Everyone has baggage, and it's not always easy to work through it. Maybe he's not ready to talk about it yet, but that doesn't mean he's not willing to work on it. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting you and see if you can find a way to move forward together."
* "I agree with the first commenter. If he's not willing to work on himself, then he's not the right person for you. You deserve someone who is committed to personal growth and self-improvement. Don't waste your time on someone who is stuck in their ways."
* "I think you're being too quick to judge. Maybe he's just not ready to talk about it yet, but that doesn't mean he's not willing to work on it. Have a conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting you and see if you can find a way to move forward together. Don't give up on him just yet."
* "I think you should take a step back and assess the situation. Are you willing to put in the work to help him through his issues, or are you just looking for someone to fix themselves? If it's the latter, then maybe this relationship isn't for you. But if you're willing to put in the effort, then maybe you can help him work through his issues and build a stronger relationship."

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thank you all for your input! I think I'm going to take a step back and assess the situation. I do want to help him work through his issues, but I also need to think about my own well-being and whether or not I'm willing to put in the work to help him. I'll have a conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting me and see if we can find a way to move forward together. Thanks again for your advice!"

TITLE: I have begun treatment for adult ADD. I feel I have climbed out of Plato's cave. Now that my brain functions at its full capacity, I hunger for knowledge. Help me nourish my ambitions!

POST: A little background information:
My condition was overlooked until now (19) due to a combination of what I assume was my intelligence compensating for the deficit and an aversion to the idea of ADD/ADHD by a great part of my family.

I first became interested in ADD while talking to a friend about her condition and, upon further research, diagnosed myself; however, that is another story.

This thread isn't about ADD and I don't want ADD to be discussed on it.  My question stems from a new found ambitious drive and the fact that, while medicated, I am able to better access and apply my mind.  A lot of my current inspiration comes from the idea of a renaissance man, Edmond Dantes, and The Most Interesting Man in the World.

All being said, I humbly ask my fellow Redditors to answer a few questions:
(feel free to answer as many or as few as you please)

What do you wish you would have done  (to invest in yourself) when you were 18-22?

Name your top 3 books/philosophers/inspirational materials of all time.

Convince me why I should learn a specific language as opposed to any other.

Ladies of Reddit, what sort of learned habits/characteristics/hobbies/skills do  you find attractive in a Man?

What is a skill/subject I should dedicate some time to grow/learn about that will benefit me down the road?

What ideas/motifs should I attempt to avoid throughout my human experience?

Any other piece of information you would like to give me.

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with adult ADD, and with treatment, I've experienced a newfound sense of ambition. I'm seeking advice on how to nourish my ambitions and grow as a person. Help me learn, grow, and avoid pitfalls!

---

This post is an excellent example of how the r/AskReddit community can provide valuable insights and advice to individuals seeking guidance. The OP (original poster) is open about their struggles with ADD and is eager to learn and grow as a person. The community responds with thoughtful and diverse answers, offering advice on everything from language learning to personal development.

Some notable responses include:

* A user suggesting that the OP learn Spanish, citing its widespread use and the benefits of being able to communicate with a large portion of the global population.
* A user recommending the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey, stating that it has had a profound impact on their own personal development.
* A user advising the OP to focus on developing their critical thinking skills, suggesting that they read books on philosophy, science, and history to improve their ability to analyze complex information.
* A user sharing their own experiences with ADD, offering words of encouragement and advice on how to manage the condition.

Overall, this post is a great example of the r/AskReddit community's ability to provide support, guidance, and inspiration to individuals seeking to improve themselves and their lives.

TITLE: Me (22f) and boyfriend (21m) of 7 years moving in together for the first time across country

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years this November. We've been together since we were 14 and 15 and have never broken up. I would have liked to live together already at this point, but his parents have a rule that we cannot get engaged, married, or live together while he's in college. 

He's just about to start his senior year of college and he's already got job interviews lined up for the west coast. He would like to work on the East or West coast while I'm hoping for West. We currently live in the Midwest (USA) but in separate houses. We're both concerned that because we've never lived together a move across the country to live together might break our relationship. I suggested that we do couples counseling. I have been in therapy personally for my own issues for about a year and have found it very helpful. We've had big fights in the past where I've brought up couples counseling, but he doesn't want to go because he feels uncomfortable with it and thinks we can fix our problems ourselves. 

I think it would be beneficial to do preventative couples counseling for this school year before we make the big move. He seems slightly more open to it than he has before because he's concerned as well and feels unprepared for the future. We have been through so much together and we're on the same page about big things like religion and children. We have a very solid foundation and there is so much love between us. We just want to be as prepared as possible so that our relationship flourishes when we move in together for the first time. 

My question is has anybody gone through something similar and what would you recommend for us to be successful? Do you think couples counseling is a good idea for us? Please share your experiences and any advice you have! Thank you very much.

TL;DR: Me and my boyfriend of 7 years are moving in together for the first time across the country. We're both concerned about the potential impact on our relationship. I think couples counseling would be beneficial, but he's hesitant. Has anyone gone through something similar and what would you recommend for us to be successful? 

**REPLIES:**

1. "I went through a similar situation with my partner. We were moving in together for the first time and were both nervous about how it would affect our relationship. We decided to do couples counseling and it was one of the best decisions we ever made. It helped us communicate better, work through our issues, and prepare for the challenges of living together. I would highly recommend it to you and your boyfriend. It's not about fixing problems, but about being proactive and building a stronger relationship."

2. "I think couples counseling is a great idea! It's not about being 'broken' or 'fixing' anything, it's about being proactive and taking care of your relationship. You and your boyfriend have a solid foundation, and counseling can help you build on that. It's also a great way to learn how to communicate effectively and work through conflicts in a healthy way. Don't give up on the idea just because your boyfriend is hesitant. Keep having open and honest conversations with him about why you think counseling would be beneficial, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."

3. "I'm not sure if couples counseling is the right fit for you and your boyfriend, but I do think it's worth exploring. Have you considered doing some online research or reading books about relationships and communication? There are a lot of great resources out there that can help you and your boyfriend learn how to communicate more effectively and work through conflicts in a healthy way. You could also try having some open and honest conversations with your boyfriend about what you're both looking for in your relationship and what you're afraid of. Sometimes just talking through your fears and desires can help you feel more connected and prepared for the challenges of living together."

4. "I think it's great that you're thinking about seeking counseling! It's not always easy to admit when we need help, but it's a sign of strength and commitment to your relationship. I would suggest finding a therapist who specializes in relationships and couples therapy. They can help you and your boyfriend work through any issues that come up and provide you with tools and strategies for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Remember, counseling is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength and a desire to build a stronger and more resilient relationship."

5. "I'm not sure if couples counseling is the right fit for you and your boyfriend, but I do think it's worth considering. Have you considered doing some online research or reading books about relationships and communication?

Sometimes just talking through your fears and desires can help you feel more connected and prepared for the challenges of living together."

TITLE: What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done in a relationship?

POST: I've been in a relationship for a few years now and I've done some pretty silly things. But one time that stands out was when my partner and I decided to have a "reality TV show" style competition to see who could do the most chores around the house. We set up a fake "judging panel" and everything. It was ridiculous, but it

TITLE: [24/m] I am that controlling boyfriend.

POST: Actually, I was that controlling boyfriend. I noticed it, but thought that it was just a little phase I was going through because of stress at work, past relationship experience, blah blah blah; but really, it doesn't seem like that was it at all.

It was pretty bad. I'd make mountains out of molehills, volcanoes out of mountains, and could find any reason in my head to think that she was deceiving me. Part of my personality is very analytic and I have a good memory, which didn't help at all. She would tell me about her day or a story from her past, and if something didn't add up I would prod and say things like, "yeah, but you also said..." or "but wait, didn't you do..."

It was bad, all bad.

The worst part is that in my head, I was sure that I was really in love with her and wanted her to have freedom. But in the back of my head, I was worried that deception is everywhere and its never that easy. I would get so sure of myself, becoming condescending while I told her what she was *really* thinking or did. Then, she'd finally get the straight story through to me and I'd start bawling and apologizing. I swore up and down that it wouldn't happen again, but it always would. 

Well, the day after I called about enrolling in therapy, she dumped me. I deserved it 100% and I'm not here to ask how to get her back, because, frankly, it will never happen. But, I'm wondering what experience and insight I can find here to help me overcome this problem. I would like a healthy relationship in the future, but I am completely incapable of having one, as I am now.

TL;DR: I was a controlling boyfriend, realized it, and got dumped. I want to learn how to overcome this problem and have a healthy relationship in the future.

TITLE: Pet lovers, how do you keep your home clean?

POST: Everyone has their favorite tricks/tips to keeping a clean house, so I'm curious...and in the market for a new vacuum and/or steam mop. 

We have three adult cats and one Italian Greyhound puppy and live in a mostly hard-wood apartment [two carpeted rooms and two large area rugs]. The cats are short hair but shed like crazy [black, white and grey!] and IGs don't really shed at all, but track in a decent amount of dirt from the yard. Getting sick of sweeping, swiffering and then pushing around dirt with a mop. It'd be nice to have a vacuum that picks up dirt and hair effectively on hardwood and carpet and I'm strongly considering investing in a steam mop.

So what do you do? What do you recommend?

TL;DR: Three cats, one puppy, hard-wood apartment, need help with cleaning and vacuum/steam mop recommendations!

**Top comments:**

1. **u/CleanFreak99**: "I'm a huge fan of the Dyson V7 Animal vacuum. It's lightweight, easy to maneuver, and picks up cat hair like a champ. I also use a steam mop, the Bissell Steam Mop 19404, and it's amazing for getting into tight spaces and cleaning up spills. Both are worth the investment!"
2. **u/PetParent101**: "I swear by the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional vacuum. It's a beast on hardwood and carpet, and the detachable canister makes it easy to get into tight spaces. For steam mopping, I use the Hoover Steam Mop FH50150. It's affordable and does the trick."
3. **u/CatLady3000**: "I've tried several vacuums and steam mops, but my favorite combo is the Miele Complete C3 Limited Edition vacuum and the Bissell Steam Mop 19404. The Miele is a game-changer for pet hair, and the Bissell steam mop is great for getting into tight spaces and cleaning up spills."
4. **u/PuppyLove22**: "I have a similar setup with two dogs and a cat, and I swear by the Dyson V8 Absolute vacuum. It's a bit pricier, but it's worth it for the suction power and versatility. For steam mopping, I use the Shark Steam Mop S1001. It's easy to use and gets the job done."
5. **u/FurryFriendFan**: "I'm a big fan of the Hoover WindTunnel 2 Rewind Pet Bagless vacuum. It's affordable, easy to use, and does a great job on both hardwood and carpet. For steam mopping, I use the Bissell Steam Mop 19404. It's a great value for the price."

TITLE: How do I end a friendship even though they haven't done anything wrong?

POST: I am in a situation that I have dreaded, and since I can't sleep, I figured I would reach out.

I(24F) was friends with a group of guys in college my first two years- it was maybe the social circle I hung out with third most? They all lived in my same dorm community and I was pretty close to one of the guys because of our shared interest in video games. The rest of them I just enjoyed the company of and because they were in close proximity, we naturally would grab meals and hang out in the dorm. I don't think we ever went to any parties or any non campus based activity. I have since lost touch with most of them.

One of them attempted to get in touch a few months ago since we now live in the same city. It seemed like he had just gotten out of a relationship. I told him we could hang out when I wasn't busy with work. He reached out to me again a few weeks ago and I ignored him. I know I probably should have addressed this then. Now he has messaged me saying that he wants to know why the animosity between us and why I'm ignoring him.

He hasn't done anything wrong, I just don't have the desire or social capacity to continue a friendship. I often move from one social circle to the next and will maybe find one person I genuinely want to be life long friends with. I find myself stretched thin just keeping up with that handful of friends. I find most of my time spent with them, my SO and my two sisters, and they make me very happy. Some past friends have figured this out about me, and with others it is a gradual growing apart. I don't know how to handle someone trying to come back into my life uninvited. I also can admit that my concern the first time that he wanted to explore a possible romance opportunity and I was having none of that.

I don't think it makes me a bad person to not continue being friends with this person, but I don't know how to end the friendship without being an asshole. r/relationships, have you ever been in a similar situation? How do I respond to this person?

TL;DR: I don't want to be friends with someone from my college days, but I don't want to hurt their feelings. I've lost touch with most of them, but this one guy has reached out and wants to know why I'm ignoring him. I don't have the desire or social capacity to continue the friendship, but I don't know how to end it without being an asshole.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Honestly, it sounds like you're just not interested in maintaining a friendship with this person, and that's okay. You don't owe anyone an explanation for why you don't want to be friends with them. You can simply tell him that you're not interested in rekindling the friendship and move on. Don't feel obligated to justify your decision or provide a detailed explanation.
2. **SarcasticSally**: I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with him. You can say something like, "Hey, I appreciate the effort, but I've moved on and I don't have the time or energy to maintain a friendship with you right now." Don't make up some elaborate excuse or try to sugarcoat it. Just be direct and clear.
3. **ConcernedCitizen**: I understand where you're coming from, but I think you should consider being more empathetic towards this person. They're reaching out to you because they value the friendship and are willing to put in effort to maintain it. Don't dismiss their feelings so easily. You could try to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and boundaries.
4. **RealTalk**: Listen, if you're not interested in being friends with this person, then just be honest with them. You don't owe them an explanation or a detailed justification. Just say, "Hey, I appreciate the effort, but I'm not interested in being friends right now." Don't make it complicated. Just be direct and clear.
5. **FriendshipFiasco**: I think you're being too harsh. You don't have to end the friendship abruptly or without explanation. You could try to have a conversation with this person and explain your feelings and boundaries. Maybe you can even find a way to maintain a cordial relationship or a friendly acquaintance. Don't dismiss the possibility of a positive outcome.

---

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post highlight the complexity of ending a friendship, even when it's not a toxic or abusive relationship. The OP is struggling with how to end the friendship without hurting the other person's feelings or being perceived as an asshole. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from being direct and honest to being empathetic and open to finding a middle ground. Ultimately, the OP will need to decide how to approach the situation based on their own values and boundaries.

TITLE: Me [21/F] with my hookup [24/M] recently few months, Advice Hookup: Go after it or stay put?

POST: I've been friends with this guy that goes to college on the same campus as me for over a year. We would always catch up and hang out between classes, and even have some homework nights that would involve wine and getting our work done. I had always had a crush on him but he is so hard to read that I thought I was completely friend zoned.

It wasn't until one night I came back from the bars early and wanted to keep drinking that I asked if he was down to hang out and drink. I went over and we drank, talked and ended up watching episode after episode of a TV show. No moves were made this entire time. Then as it reached the early hours of the morning I fell asleep during one of the episodes and he woke me up to basically making out with me and hooking up.

After this I didn't know what to do so I just sort of waited for him to say anything and I think we were both in shock so I just got dressed and we swapped a few words and I dipped out. Just recently we hooked up again after he came to a kickback I threw and we went back to his apartment with friends to play some drinking games and then I went back to my place only to get an invite to come back down. After this hookup he's the one that left me and told me was only leaving bc he had to be up in 3 hours. But we never kiss or anything after its just put on clothes and awkwardly showing each other out the door.

His friends have been pushing me to go after him and saying that he's lazy in the fact that he can want something but never really goes out of his way to get things. He also has told his friends in front of me that you cant just be friends with girls and also be attracted to them and plan to hookup because it doesn't work that way. So should I try to go after it or just keep it how it is now? My friends tell me I'm the Ice Queen and I don't show enough interest.

TL;DR: I've been hooking up with this guy for a few months, we're friends but he's hard to read. He's lazy and doesn't make moves, friends are telling me to go after him but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

* "Honestly, if you're not getting the attention and affection you want from him, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve better than someone who is lazy and doesn't make an effort."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and expectations. If he's not willing to put in the effort to make things work, then it might be time to move on."
* "It sounds like he's not interested in taking things to the next level, and that's okay. You don't have to settle for someone who doesn't want to make an effort. You deserve someone who is willing to work for you."
* "I think you should take your friends' advice and go after it. If he's not willing to put in the effort, then you deserve someone who will. You're worth it!"
* "It's okay to be the 'Ice Queen' sometimes. You don't have to show interest if you're not feeling it. But if you do want to make things work, then you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and expectations."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with him about what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. If he's not willing to listen and work with you, then it might be time to move on."
* "It sounds like he's not taking you seriously, and that's not okay. You deserve someone who respects and values you. You should try to have a conversation with him about how you feel and what you want."

TITLE: Me [25F] with my friend [27F], she hasn't made an effort to hang out with me for about two months despite being friends for about 17 years. What should I do?

POST: I should preface this by saying that she lives about 5 minutes away from me, we've known each other for 17 years, but I don't know if she is choosing to drift away or is just naturally busy.

She hasn't made the effort to hang out with me for two months and had been declining hanging out with me to the point where we would only hang out on weeknight rather than the weekend.

She has a mom that has quite a few mental-health related 'issues' but I think the majority of her time has basically been spent with her boyfriend.

I feel like she's ditching me which is fine, but I don't know what I should say if she tries to reach out.  She has also stopped texting me and only sent me one text in the course of a month and a half...Should I end the friendship if she reaches out again?

TL;DR: Friend of 17 years hasn't made an effort to hang out with me for 2 months, stopped texting me, and only hangs out on weeknights. What should I do if she reaches out again?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's been prioritizing her boyfriend and her mom over you. If she's not making an effort to hang out with you, it's probably time to reevaluate the friendship. You deserve better than to be treated like an afterthought."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you value your friendship and that you've noticed a change in her behavior. It's possible that she's going through a tough time and doesn't realize how her actions are affecting you."
* "If she reaches out again, you could try saying something like 'Hey, I've noticed we haven't hung out in a while and I've been feeling a bit left out. Is everything okay? Is there something going on that's making it hard for you to hang out?' This shows that you care about her and are willing to listen, but also sets boundaries and lets her know that you expect more effort from the friendship."
* "It's possible that she's just going through a busy phase and will come back around once things settle down. But if you're feeling like you're constantly reaching out and initiating hangouts, it might be time to take a step back and prioritize your own needs. You don't have to end the friendship, but you do deserve to have a more balanced and fulfilling relationship."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not be interested in rekindling the friendship. You can't force someone to be your friend, and you deserve to surround yourself with people who prioritize and value your relationship."

TITLE: Want to tell me the story of your life?

POST: Hey!
First off, sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.

I don't know if there is any kind of specific reddit for this, so please tell me if there is a better place to post.

I'm in college studing arts in Barcelona, and i'm doing an antropology work where i have to search someone to tell me the story of his life. I thought that doing this in the street could be quite troublesome, since people might not want to tell face to face some parts of their life, so i thought that reddit could help me, becouse of the anonymity of internet.

I'm not searching for an incredible and full of awesomeness fake story, i just want some real human, kinda detailed (around 2 - 3 pages), story. I know u might be just lazy, so don't even care about ortography or structure of the text; I'll have to translate it into spanish or catalan. I just want to ask for sincerity.

Needless to say, you will be appearing as anonymous.

TL;DR: I'm doing an anthropology work and I need someone to tell me the story of their life. I'm looking for a real, detailed, and sincere story. You can be anonymous.

COMMENTS:

* "I'd be happy to share my story with you. It's not a typical 'rags to riches' story, but it's mine. I grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and my parents were high school sweethearts. I was a bit of a troublemaker as a kid, always getting into mischief and pushing boundaries. I got into some trouble in high school, and ended up dropping out for a year. During that time, I worked odd jobs and traveled a bit. Eventually, I went back to school and finished my GED. I then went on to college and studied art, which is what I'm doing now. I've had my share of ups and downs, but I'm proud of the person I've become."
* "I'd love to share my story with you. I grew up in a big city, and my parents were immigrants. They worked hard to provide for me and my siblings, but we struggled financially. I had to work multiple jobs to help support my family, and I often felt like I was missing out on a normal childhood. I was always drawn to art, and I started taking classes in high school. I went on to study fine art in college, and I've been working as an artist ever since. It's not always easy, but it's what I love."
* "I'm not sure if I'm the right person for this, but I'll give it a shot. I grew up in a small town in the South, and my family was pretty traditional. I was expected to go to college and get a'respectable' job, but I never felt like that was what I wanted. I dropped out of college after one year and moved to the city to pursue a career in music. It wasn't easy, and I had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. But I never gave up, and I eventually started to make a name for myself in the music scene. I've had my share of ups and downs, but I'm proud of the person I've become."

These comments are just examples, but they show the kind of stories that people might share in response to this post. The stories are real, detailed, and sincere, and they give a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people. The post is a great example of how Reddit can be used as a platform for sharing personal stories and connecting with others.

TITLE: Me[18F] with my partner [18M] together 1 year, thinking of moving in together

POST: We've been considering moving in together. We've really been growing in to our relationship, and despise our age have matured into it. I've had a lot of struggles through the year - including my father's death. He has not left me, or avoided me, but he supported me through it all.

We're both studying a bachelor at university (first year) - he has a decent paying job (about $400 a week), and I've been getting temporary jobs here and there (Currently working 2, and earning $500 week). If we register our relationship officially and move in together, we will both be eligible for about $400-500 of government assistance each. 

We are both ready for the challenge, and one way or another I am moving out of home. We won't be moving out until December-January, earliest. I will hopefully have a more permanent job, consistent.

I'm seeing a lot of positives to moving in together, it may help develop our relationship further and build a life. We're certainly not ready for kids or marriage or anything. Just moving in together, into a small house/flat for rent (which is pretty cheap in our town, I've looked into it).

So, money aside - I'm really focused on the good points, and I'm hoping I'm not overlooking a crucial point. Is there some dead obvious reason not to move in together? Or any good advice on handle the situation, assuming it does go through? Or good advice for figuring it out.

I want to move in with him. I want to cook with with him, and fall asleep beside him every night. I want to drag myself home after work, and have a cup of tea with him. I want to have those moments where one of us get grumpy because our assignment is due and it's not finished until 11.34pm... and the other stays up late enough to read it through that one last time before it's submitted. I want us to sort out our problems, make decisions together, and know we're in this for each other.

TL;DR: Me and my partner have been together for a year, considering moving in together. We're both 18, studying at university, and have decent jobs. We'll be eligible for government assistance if we register our relationship officially. We're excited about the prospect, but want to make sure we're not overlooking any crucial points. Any advice on handling the situation or figuring it out would be great.

TITLE: Dear Reddit, What silly/irrelevant/rediculous family miscommunications have lead to feuds lasting years?

POST: My Grandma and my aunt (her daugher-in-aw) haven't spoken to each other in years over a phone that didn't get hung up.  My aunt and uncle screen their calls and frequently do not return them-- one time, my grandma called and left a message then thought she hung up the phone.  A few minutes later-- my Grandma was talking with someone in her home and used the word "bitch"-- this was all recorded on my aunt and uncle's answering machine and my aunt assumed it was about her and hasn't spoken to nor seen my Grandma in upwards of 5 years.  My Grandma wants to reconcile and clear the air, but my aunt won't go near her, won't let her husband (G-ma's son) and kids go there, and avoids family events.  My Grandma is almost 85-- and I think this is rediculous.  Why waste time the time you have with somone?  Why continue to hold a silly grudge?  To complicate matters further, my grandma has a daughter who lives with her and likes to be in other peoples business-- I think she is also part of the problem here as she won't drop it either.  Grandma is innocent but has a daughter and daughter-in-law who won't grow up and drop it.

TL;DR: Grandma and aunt haven't spoken in 5 years over a misunderstanding about a phone call. Grandma wants to clear the air, but aunt won't budge. Grandma's daughter is also stirring the pot.

---

**Comments:**

1. "This is insane. I'd be willing to bet that the daughter-in-law is the one who's really holding onto this grudge and not letting go. I mean, who gets mad over a phone call? It's ridiculous."
2. "I think it's time for a family intervention. Get everyone together and have a calm, rational conversation about what happened and how it's affecting everyone. It's not worth wasting years of your life over something so petty."
3. "I can see why your grandma would be upset. It's not like she meant to call her daughter-in-law a 'bitch'! It's just a silly misunderstanding. I hope they can work things out soon."
4. "I think the daughter-in-law is being really unfair. If she's so hurt by what she heard, she should have talked to her mom-in-law about it instead of just cutting her off. Now it's too late and it's affecting the whole family."
5. "I've seen this kind of thing happen before. It's like people get stuck in this cycle of anger and resentment and they can't get out of it. I hope your grandma can find a way to move on and not let this define her relationship with her daughter-in-law."
6. "I think it's time for your grandma to set some boundaries with her daughter. If she's going to stir up trouble and not help resolve the issue, then maybe it's time for your grandma to take a step back and focus on her own relationships."
7. "This is so sad. I hope they can find a way to work things out soon. It's not worth losing years of your life over something so silly."
8. "I think it's time for a family meeting. Get everyone together and have a calm, rational conversation about what happened and how it's affecting everyone. It's not worth wasting years of your life over something so petty."
9. "I think the daughter-in-law is being really unfair. If she's so hurt by what she heard, she should have talked to her mom-in-law about it instead of just cutting her off. Now it's too late and it's affecting the whole family."
10. "I think it's time for your grandma to take a step back and focus on her own relationships. If she's going to let this kind of thing define her relationship with her daughter-in-law, then maybe it's time for her to move on and find people who are more supportive and understanding."



---

**Reddit's Response:**

The post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users expressing their shock and disbelief at the situation. Some users have suggested that the daughter-in-law is being unfair and that she should have talked to her mom-in-law about the issue instead of just cutting her off. Others have suggested that the family should have a calm, rational conversation about what happened and how it's affecting everyone.

Some users have also suggested that the daughter-in-law may be holding onto the grudge because of her own insecurities or issues, and that she should seek counseling to work through her feelings. Others have suggested that the family should focus on the present and move forward, rather than dwelling on the past.

Overall, the response from Reddit has been overwhelmingly supportive of the grandma and has encouraged her to take a step back and focus on her own relationships. Many users have also expressed their hope that the family can find a way to work things out and move forward.

TITLE: Reddit, help me name a student-funded scholarship

POST: Hi reddit.  I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:
Each summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.

So, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.

OK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:
Nonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),

Social and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,

Triple Bottom Line Fund,

Socially Responsible Internship Fund.

See, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.

TL;DR: Need a name for a student-funded fellowship program that supports MBA students taking unpaid internships with nonprofit, government, or socially/environmentally driven organizations.  Help me come up with something catchy and meaningful.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: How about "Balance Fellowship"? It captures the idea of balancing out the 3-legged stool and is easy to remember.
2. **u/financeguru**: I like "Impact Internship Fund" or "Social Impact Fellowship". It emphasizes the idea that these internships are making a positive impact.
3. **u/environmentalist**: What about "The Bridge Fellowship"? It suggests bridging the gap between the for-profit and non-profit sectors.
4. **u/marketingmaven**: How about "The Social Shift Fellowship"? It implies a shift towards a more socially responsible approach.
5. **u/energyenthusiast**: I like "The Triple Bottom Line Fellowship" - it's a bit longer, but it's a great way to describe the program's goals.

**Other notable comments:**

* **u/nonprofitnovice**: I think "The Giving Back Fellowship" could be a great name. It emphasizes the idea that students are giving back to their community.
* **u/socialjustice**: What about "The Justice Internship Fund"? It's a bit more provocative, but it emphasizes the idea that these internships are fighting for social justice.
* **u/entrepreneur**: How about "The Social Entrepreneurship Fellowship"? It emphasizes the idea that these internships are supporting social entrepreneurship.

**Conclusion:**

The Reddit community has provided a wide range of suggestions for the student-funded fellowship program. Some popular options include "Balance Fellowship", "Impact Internship Fund", "Social Impact Fellowship", "The Bridge Fellowship", "The Social Shift Fellowship", and "The Triple Bottom Line Fellowship". Ultimately, the chosen name should reflect the program's goals and values, as well as be easy to remember and pronounce. The OP can use these suggestions as inspiration to find the perfect name for their program.

TITLE: Not sure how I (24/m) feel about girl (22/f) that I've been dating for a month

POST: So I've been dating this girl for a month and on paper we are perfect for each other. On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.

However I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:

a) Am not really that interested in her. 

b) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. 

c) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.

d) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.

e) All of the above

TL;DR: I'm dating a girl who is perfect for me on paper, but I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her. I'm confused as to why and I'm not sure if it's because I'm not really interested, the relationship is doomed, I'm still numb from my ex, I'm growing up, or a combination of the above.

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in online dating and relationships, where individuals struggle to understand their own feelings and motivations. The OP (original poster) is trying to make sense of his emotions and is seeking advice from the community.

The post is well-written and provides a clear overview of the situation, including the OP's feelings, the girl's characteristics, and the challenges he is facing. The OP is also open to different possibilities and is willing to consider various explanations for his lack of infatuation.

The community's response to this post is likely to be varied and may include a range of opinions and advice. Some people may suggest that the OP is not fully committed to the relationship or that he is still recovering from the pain of his ex. Others may advise the OP to take things slow and get to know the girl better before making any judgments about his feelings.

Overall, this post is a great example of how online communities can provide a platform for individuals to share their experiences and seek advice from others who have gone through similar situations.

TITLE: TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike

POST: I didn't hurt my head but I got injured in another way. So I rode a bike today, something I rarely do. I grabbed a helmet and put it on the handlebars of the bike. After riding for maybe a quarter mile the strap of the helmet which was hanging down near the wheel got caught in the front wheel. The bike immediately stopped moving and I flew over the handlebars. I landed (hard) on my knees, left arm, and hip. I have no idea how I didn't hit my head, but if I did this may have been a much more serious ordeal.

TL;DR: I didn't wear a helmet and it almost cost me dearly. I'm just glad I didn't get hurt worse.

COMMENT 1: "TIFU by not wearing a helmet on a bike" is a great title. You're lucky you didn't get hurt worse. Next time, just put the helmet on your head, not the handlebars."

COMMENT 2: "I've had a similar experience, but with a scarf getting caught in the wheel. I was lucky to have escaped with just a bruised ego. Moral of the story: always wear your gear, even if you think you're being careful."

COMMENT 3: "I'm surprised you didn't hurt your head, but glad you're okay. Just a reminder to always wear your helmet, even if you're just riding a short distance. You never know what might happen."

COMMENT 4: "I've had a few close calls on my bike, but I've never had anything as crazy as that happen. You're lucky to be alive! Next time, just put the helmet on your head, not the handlebars."

COMMENT 5: "I'm glad you're okay, but that's a great reminder to always wear your helmet. You never know when something might go wrong. Just put the helmet on your head and forget about it, it's not worth the risk."  SUBREDDIT: r/tifu

TITLE: I[F21] showed my boyfriend [M21] some vacation photos I had taken with my black boyfriend few years back. He got mad and is ice cold towards me right now.

POST: I was showing my boyfriend photos from Greece when I was there a few years ago. he is a big history buff so we cuddled in bed and looked through the photos. I was there with my black boyfriend so he was of course in a lot of those photos. my new boyfriend asked who he was and when I said it was my ex-boyfriend he replied with a pained "oh ok" so we stopped looking at photos and watched some netflix instead.

he got really quiet and didnt want to cuddle anymore, he just sat and read a book. after a few hours i just had to ask
him what was up with his reaction to the photos with my boyfriend?

He said something like "why would you even date me? if you like black guys so much why don't you date black guys? what's the point of being with me? im not your type" 

I didn't even know I had a type. I just thought he was cute and nice so we dated. He didn't like my answer, got upset, we fought and he left.

I don't really understand his reaction, it was actually very shocking. He has never come off as racist in the year I have known him, more like the opposite. He is a really sweet and fun guy and this was very out of character for him.
that was a week ago now and he didnt text me once. nothing. at first i expected an apology but got nothing so i started texting him and he is really distant and cold in his responses. i ask him what I did wrong and he doesnt answer me and avoids the subject. 

i ask him if he wants to break up and he said no and then stopped responding. what the hell is up with him?

TL;DR: I showed my boyfriend some vacation photos from Greece where I was with my black ex-boyfriend. He got mad, said I'm not his type, and now he's distant and cold towards me.

---

This post is a great example of how a seemingly innocent action can lead to a major conflict in a relationship. The OP (original poster) was simply sharing some vacation photos with her boyfriend, but his reaction was extreme and hurtful. The boyfriend's comments about not being her "type" and implying that she's only with him because she's not with a black guy are racist and unacceptable.

The OP is understandably upset and confused by her boyfriend's reaction. She didn't expect him to be racist and thought he was a sweet and fun guy. She's trying to understand what she did wrong and why he's being so distant and cold towards her.

The post has received many comments from users who are outraged by the boyfriend's behavior and are offering support and advice to the OP. Some users are suggesting that the OP should end the relationship immediately, while others are advising her to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about his behavior.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. It also shows how quickly a situation can escalate and how important it is to address issues as they arise.

TITLE: Me [21 M] seeing [Late 30's M], is it weird?

POST: So basically I've been hanging out with this guy who is in his late 30's. Almost a 20 year age difference. He looks great and seems like an okay guy but I feel like if I was in his situation I wouldn't even look at someone as young as me. It makes me think that he's strange to want to even talk with someone who is in a completely different stage of their life and are naive about a lot of aspects of life that he's experienced. He's come on pretty strong and I can make this into something if I want to. So what do y'all think, does he have issues? Using me for sex? Or can someone who is older and has dated with that much of an age gap explain why he would date that much younger

TL;DR: 21M dating 30'sM, 20 year age gap, feels weird and unsure if he's using me for sex or has genuine feelings

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's not uncommon for older men to date younger women, and it's not always about using them for sex. Maybe he's looking for a fresh perspective or a chance to relive his youth. That being said, it's definitely important to communicate openly with him about your feelings and boundaries. Make sure you're comfortable with the age gap and that he's not taking advantage of you."
* "I'm a 35F who dated a 25M and it was amazing. We had a great connection and it wasn't about the age difference. It's all about the individual and what they bring to the table. If you're feeling weird about it, maybe have a conversation with him about it. But don't assume he's using you for sex just because of the age gap."
* "I think it's weird, but not necessarily in a bad way. It's definitely unconventional, but if you're both comfortable with it, then that's all that matters. Just make sure you're not being taken advantage of or used for his ego boost. Communication is key in any relationship, so make sure you're having open and honest conversations with each other."
* "I'm a 40M who dated a 20F and it was a disaster. The age gap was way too big and we had completely different life experiences. It was hard to connect and it ended up being a huge mistake. So, to answer your question, yes, it's weird, and it's not always a good idea. But hey, if you're both into it and it works for you, then that's your business."
* "I think it's weird, but not necessarily in a bad way. It's definitely unconventional, but if you're both comfortable with it, then that's all that matters. Just make sure you're not being taken advantage of or used for his ego boost. Communication is key in any relationship, so make sure you're having open and honest conversations with each other."

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people expressing that it's not uncommon for older men to date younger women and that it's not always about using them for sex. Others are more skeptical and think that the age gap is too big and that it's not a good idea. Some people are neutral and think that it's weird, but not necessarily in a bad way, as long as the couple is comfortable with it and communicates openly. Overall, the comments suggest that the age gap is a significant factor in the relationship and that it's important for the couple to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and boundaries.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my college friend [19 F] about 1 month, I wanna hang out with her but I don't have a car.

POST: This is the link for an earlier thread I posted about her 

She basically doesn't have any friends and will spend all her spring break at home playing video games. I wanna hang out with her, but both of us don't have a car. I live with my grandma 10 minutes away from her house. Would it be weird to ask her to spend a day with us playing video games and eating pizza?

 Another thing I could do is ask her to go see a movie with me, but I would just meet her there since I'll be going with a bike. Do you guys think it's okay to do that? I also have 0 experience with girls. You can say this is the first girl in my life.

TL;DR: I'm 18, with a college friend who's 19, we've been hanging out for a month. I wanna spend more time with her, but we don't have a car. I'm worried it's weird to ask her to hang out at my grandma's house or meet her at a movie theater. I have no experience with girls.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, it's not weird at all. You're just trying to spend time with someone you care about. Just be honest with her and ask her what she'd like to do. If she says no, then you can always ask her again another time."
* "I think it's sweet that you're thinking about her and wanting to spend time with her. Just don't make it too obvious that you're trying to 'get' her or anything. Just be chill and have fun. And yeah, ask her to hang out at your grandma's house, it's a great idea!"
* "I think you should ask her to hang out at your grandma's house, it's a neutral location and it's not too much of a commitment. And if she says no, then you can always ask her again another time. Just don't get discouraged if she says no, it's not the end of the world."
* "I think you should just be yourself and be honest with her. If she's interested in spending time with you, then she'll say yes. And if she doesn't, then you can always ask her again another time. Just don't put too much pressure on it."

TITLE: Fast way to regain stamina after a run?

POST: Hey /r/running, 

Last week my teacher told me the school was organizing a run. Everybody has to take part in a 20 minute run, which is part of an 8-hour relay with everyone from the school. Or if you would like to you can form a group of 6 people and run the full 8 hours with them. 

Kind of jokingly I asked a friend of mine if he would like to do the full 8-hour run, he said yes, then someone else said she wanted to join our group, and now we're going to do it... We've decided it would be best to run in segments of 10 minutes so everyone will run eight times for ten minutes. 

Here's the thing though, my condition is not that good, at all. Last Thursday I ran 1,8km in 13 minutes and 28 seconds (8,03km/h) and today I ran 2,33km in 14:23 (9,72km/h). There are two things I would like to ask: 

-What would be a good strategy to improve my stamina so I'll be able to run for a longer time? 

-After I'm done with the first 10 minutes of running, how will I be able to regain stamina as quickly as possible (~50 minutes) to run the next 10 minutes, and then again.

I'm 16y/o, the run will be in two weeks, do you think it's possible? I just keep telling myself to just do it :)

TL;DR: I'm 16y/o and I'm going to run 8 hours with my friends in 2 weeks. I'm not in good condition, but I want to improve my stamina. What's a good strategy to improve my stamina and how can I regain it quickly after a 10-minute run?

**REPLIES:**

1. **u/runningcoach**: Hey there! Congratulations on taking the initiative to improve your stamina. Here are a few tips to help you:

* Start with shorter runs and gradually increase the distance and duration. This will help your body adapt to the demands of running.
* Incorporate interval training into your routine. This involves alternating between periods of high-intensity running and active recovery. For example, you could run at a fast pace for 5 minutes, then walk or jog for 2 minutes to recover.
* Focus on building your endurance by incorporating longer runs into your routine. Start with 20-30 minute runs and gradually increase the duration.
* Make sure to warm up before each run by doing some light cardio and stretching. This will help prevent injuries and improve your performance.
* Cool down after each run by stretching and doing some light cardio. This will help your body recover and reduce the risk of injury.

As for regaining stamina after a 10-minute run, here are a few tips:

* Take a 5-10 minute walk or jog to help your body recover. This will help your heart rate slow down and your breathing return to normal.
* Incorporate stretching and foam rolling into your routine. This will help reduce muscle soreness and improve your flexibility.
* Make sure to fuel your body with a balanced diet that includes plenty of protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This will help your body recover and support muscle growth.

Remember, consistency is key when it comes to improving your stamina. Stick to your training plan and you'll see improvements over time.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my ex [21 F] of a little over 2 years. Have been "broken-up" for months but continued to see each other casually. She is finally moving on and seeing someone else. I'm sad. Parents and family adored her. Need advice on to break the news and get back in the game.

POST: Hi All, 

So I was totally into this girl but it is finally fizzing out. I've pretty much been in denial about the whole thing since we've "broken up" but it's finally now catching up to me because she's seeing someone else now. Friends and family still talk like she's my girlfriend. I know it wasn't healthy just pushing it away for so long but I need to face the music.

My family basically treated her like family because they liked her so much. I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this? 

Idk maybe I'm just kind of venting. This sucks.

TL;DR: Ex of 2+ years is moving on and I'm struggling to accept it. Need advice on how to break the news to family and get back in the game.

TITLE: (SOMEWHAT URGENT) Training a worker that doesn't respect my authority.

POST: I got in to work today to find that I will be training someone to take over someone else's shift.

I've only been here an hour and so far, he's shooed me away from things, taken things out of my hands, interrupted me to boss customers around, and every time he does something the owner would kill him for (i.e. using the wrong soap or cups) I would let him know how he was supposed to do it, to be cut off by "yeah yeah yeah, I know how to do it."

Hes apparently worked at a different location previously and has forgotten a lot but insists on doing everything himself. When I try to tell him I need him to do something else he flat out says 'no.' Hes been in a phone call for the last 15 minutes.

Its just his first shift. I know I have to put my foot down. But how do I do so without starting an argument? I'm stuck here with him until 10 and will probably be training him again after today, but I need to make it clear that he DOES have to listen to me sometimes.

TL;DR: New worker doesn't respect my authority, won't listen, and is doing things wrong. How do I assert my authority without starting an argument?

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

* "Have a calm and assertive conversation with him. Explain that you're there to help him learn and that you need him to listen to you. Use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, 'I feel frustrated when...' instead of 'You're not listening to me...'"
* "Try to find common ground with him. Ask him about his previous experience and what he's learned. Show genuine interest and ask for his input. This can help build a rapport and make him more receptive to your guidance."
* "Set clear expectations and boundaries from the start. Let him know what you expect from him in terms of behavior and communication. Be specific and concise, and make sure he understands what you're saying."
* "Don't be afraid to escalate the issue to a manager or supervisor if necessary. If you're not comfortable addressing the issue yourself, or if the behavior continues despite your efforts to address it, it's okay to seek help."
* "Remember that it's okay to say 'no' to someone who's not respecting your authority. You don't have to justify or explain yourself. Simply say 'I'm not comfortable with that' or 'That's not how we do things here.'"
* "Try to focus on the task at hand and the goals you're trying to achieve, rather than getting caught up in the drama or power struggle. Remember that you're both there to do a job, and that you're on the same team."

**ADDITIONAL TIPS FROM THE OP**

* "I think I'll try to have a calm and assertive conversation with him, and see if that helps. I'll also try to focus on the task at hand and not get too caught up in the drama."
* "I'll also make sure to set clear expectations and boundaries from the start, and see if that helps him understand what's expected of him."
* "I'll try to find common ground with him and build a rapport, and see if that helps him be more receptive to my guidance."
* "I'll also keep in mind that it's okay to say 'no' to someone who's not respecting my authority, and that I don't have to justify or explain myself."
* "I'll try to stay calm and professional, even if he gets defensive or argumentative. I'll remember that I'm there to do a job, and that I'm on the same team."

TITLE: I'm a dumb [21] male and so I'm having a lot of trouble interpreting the signals that this [21] girl may or may not be sending me. A little help please?

POST: So okay, I'm from New York but I study in Oregon for most of the year. Recently a friend of mine who I was not really close started facebook messaging me, that was about 3 months ago, since then we've talked almost everyday. She even asks when we can skype all the time and insists we do so and keep in touch. This sort of came out of the blue so naturally I just assumed she was into me. I can't really date her given that we live across the country, but I would if I could, she's really great in my opinion. Anyways we continue to speak to each other as usual and then last week I returned to new york for a break and so given that she and I share a group of friends I was hoping we could hang out together with them all for the little time where we're both in the same town. I tried to do just that but she totally gave me the cold shoulder; not being really responsive to hanging out, leaving early when we finally did etc...

Am I wrong in my original assumption that she was into me just because out of the blue she started talking to me a lot? Is she trying to play hard to get? Am I looking way too into this and maybe she was just occupied that weekend?

I really have no idea how to evaluate this. Do any of you guys have any suggestions/ideas?

TL;DR: Girl I've been talking to on Facebook for 3 months started talking to me out of the blue, we've been talking almost daily, she asks to Skype and hang out. I thought she was into me, but when I tried to hang out with her in person, she gave me the cold shoulder. Am I overthinking this or is she playing hard to get?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're overthinking this. She might just be a friendly person who likes to chat. Don't assume she's into you just because she's talking to you. Try to get to know her better and see if there's any mutual interest."
* "I think you're right to be confused. If she was really into you, she would've made an effort to hang out with you in person. Maybe she's just not interested in a romantic relationship with you."
* "Have you considered that she might be going through a tough time and just wasn't in the mood to hang out? People can be moody, you know. Don't read too much into it and just move on."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you feel. Ask her if she's interested in getting to know you better and see how she responds. That way, you'll know for sure where you stand."
* "Dude, you're 21, not 12. Stop overthinking this and just ask her out. If she says no, then move on. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling to interpret the signals from the girl he's been talking to on Facebook. He's been talking to her almost daily for 3 months, and she's been asking to Skype and hang out. However, when he tried to hang out with her in person, she gave him the cold shoulder. The commenters are advising the OP to not overthink it and to try to get to know her better, or to have an open and honest conversation with her about his feelings. Some commenters are also suggesting that the girl might not be interested in a romantic relationship with him, or that she might be going through a tough time and just wasn't in the mood to hang out. Overall, the commenters are trying to help the OP make sense of the situation and figure out what's going on.

TITLE: TIFU by Burning my Butthole with Cayenne Pepper

POST: So I recently found out I have scabies on my legs and stomach. 

I made a doctors appointment for treatment next week, but I figured maybe I would find some natural remedies to at least help a little because the itching was unbearable. Turns out among the tea tree and neem oils, bathing in apple cider vinegar, you could also soak the affected areas with a cayenne pepper bath. I guess the pepper literally burns the surface mites. 

Desperate as I was, I set up a bath with everything: threw in the oils, vinegar, and a fuck ton of cayenne pepper. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but I fully immersed myself in the water. I was soaking and scrubbing my legs for a few minutes when I felt a strange sensation. I paused for a moment, then yelped in pain and jumped straight out of the bathtub. My downstairs was fucking SEARING...on both ends.

I quickly drained the tub and tried to rinse out both my lady parts and butthole, but to no avail. Peeing helped a bit, but there is some definite bleeding in my backside and the burn is killing me. 
It's been about twenty minutes. As I type I lay on my bed with an ice pack on my ass, trying to ride this one out hoping it goes away.
I'm such an idiot.

TL;DR: I tried a cayenne pepper bath to help with scabies and ended up burning my butthole and lady parts. I'm currently lying on my bed with an ice pack on my ass, hoping it goes away.

REDDITORS' REACTIONS:

* "TIFU by trying to cure scabies with cayenne pepper and ending up with a burning sensation in your butthole"
* "I think you might want to stick to the doctor's appointment next week"
* "I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure cayenne pepper isn't meant to be used as a treatment for scabies"
* "You might want to try a different approach next time, like actually following the instructions on the bottle"
* "I hope you're okay, but I'm also kind of impressed by your dedication to finding a natural remedy"
* "I think you might want to rethink your life choices"
* "I'm not sure what's more painful, the scabies or the cayenne pepper bath"
* "I hope you're taking some ibuprofen and applying some aloe vera to that poor butthole"
* "I think you might want to consider a career change, like becoming a professional guinea pig for new treatments"
* "I'm not sure what's more impressive, your determination to find a natural remedy or your ability to type with an ice pack on your ass"

This post is a great example of the "TIFU" subreddit, where people share their hilarious and often cringe-worthy stories of how they managed to mess things up. The post is relatable, entertaining, and has a good dose of humor, making it a great addition to the subreddit. The comments are also hilarious, with many people poking fun at the OP's decision to use cayenne pepper as a treatment for scabies. Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of content that makes the "TIFU" subreddit so popular.

TITLE: Has anyone ever felt sexual chemistry with someone the second time around but not the first?

POST: Backstory: I'm 22 (f) and a few days ago, on our third date, I finally had my first kiss/other shenanigans with someone I like very much.  But I didn't feel much - in fact I was rather bored and disappointed with the apparent discrepancy in our emotional and sexual reactions to making out.  A couple of days later I very grudgingly broke it off because I figured that's that - no sexual chemistry, and I didn't want to string him along.  But I really want this to not be the case because I rarely (obviously being 22 and only having just had my first kiss) meet guys whom I like quite like this.  Maybe it was just so new that I couldn't appreciate it and a second go-round would prove more lady-boner inducing?  Maybe sexual chemistry can pop up (har har) after developing more of an emotional connection?  Or maybe I'm just grasping at straws, and if it were possible to give it another shot I'd just put us both through more disappointment.

TL;DR: Had a lackluster first kiss, broke it off, but wonder if a second chance could bring out the sexual chemistry I'm looking for.

COMMENTS:

* "I've had this exact same experience! I think it's totally possible that the second time around, you'll feel more comfortable and relaxed, which can definitely enhance the chemistry. Maybe try to keep an open mind and don't put too much pressure on it. If it doesn't work out, at least you'll know for sure"
* "I think it's worth a shot! You never know what might happen. Just make sure to communicate with each other about your expectations and boundaries. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll have learned something valuable about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner"
* "I've had the opposite experience - I felt super strong chemistry the first time, but it fizzled out the second time around. Maybe it's just not meant to be? But hey, it's worth a try, and like others said, you'll learn something new about yourself and what you're looking for"
* "I think it's possible that you just needed to get past the initial awkwardness and get comfortable with each other. Sometimes it takes a little time to develop that chemistry. If you're both on the same page and willing to give it another shot, I say go for it!"
* "I've had a similar experience, and I think it's because we were both so nervous the first time around. The second time, we were more relaxed and could just enjoy each other's company. It's definitely worth a shot, and like others said, you'll learn something new about yourself and what you're looking for"

The post and comments highlight the uncertainty and curiosity that can come with exploring romantic relationships, particularly when it comes to sexual chemistry. The OP is seeking reassurance and advice on whether it's worth giving the relationship another chance, and the commenters offer a range of perspectives and experiences to consider. The conversation is characterized by empathy, understanding, and a willingness to share personal anecdotes and insights. The subreddit's focus on relationship advice and support creates a safe and non-judgmental space for users to share their thoughts and feelings, and the community's collective wisdom can be a valuable resource for those navigating the complexities of romantic relationships.

TITLE: I(17F) am hoping to move out of my pregnant, abusive, mothers house and in with my boyfriend (18M) after I turn 18. He still lives at his parents house, what can I do to make them more likely to agree to this situation?

POST: As the title says I need to move out of my house. My current living situation is not healthy and most days more often than not I cry for at least an hour because of my mother and how she treats me. She is also pregnant. I made a post awhile ago about this and my current situation for those of you who read this and it sounds familiar. 

My boyfriends parents have briefly offered before but I don't know if they were serious or not... We plan to ask them at some point soon, they do not know that my current home life is as bad as it is and I'm contemplating telling them when we ask if it would be a possibility.

 As a bit of a background my boyfriends older brother got a girl pregnant his senior year in high school and she lived with them for a long time(they have since moved out) she was lazy, created messes and basically left her kid with them so she could go do whatever it's is that she does. I would be coming into their home at least looking for a job but hopefully already having one, with a license (she didn't have one, only recently got one) and car, a high school graduate (she dropped out), in an abusive home, in college, plus I cook and clean which she never did. I'm really hoping these things will swing them in my favor. Also I would only be living there for around a year or a bit longer but not by much. Please no relationship judgement, I know we are young but this is pretty much my only option and we love each other dearly. 

His parents are a bit strict and weary of having another grandchild. That would work against me. At this point we aren't supposed to be in a room alone, if this happened that would be common.... 
Also we've been together over a year.

TL;DR: I'm 17 and pregnant, abusive mother, want to move in with my 18 year old boyfriend who still lives with his parents. We plan to ask them soon, but I'm worried about their concerns about having another grandchild. What can I do to make them more likely to agree?

TITLE: [19/m] About to meet girl [19/f] for the first time after months of online/text chat. Anyone have similar experience? Please share.

POST: Almost a year ago I met this girl on a online site and since then we have text almost every day and spoken on the phone a number of times. I don't know why we have never skyped, none of us have ever brought it up. We have however exchanged pics/videos so I'm 99.9999% she isn't some stranger from Ghana.

Anyway we've hit it off really well and I get on with her unlike anyone else I've ever spoken too. We come to eachother for advice and we have quite a good sense of eachothers personalities. Now recently she said she is going somewhere and with a bit more conversation this may end up being our first meeting as I've been looking to go somewhere and she suggested that I go with her as at least she'd roughly know someone. 

She is an incredibly nicest person and we have spoken about past relationships, she said she isn't one to judge and I've spoken/seen people she has been out with before and she herself described them as "not exactly lookers", so I'm not afraid of her seeing me and being like "what kind of creature are you" as I'm not exactly overweight or hard to look at. I am however still incredibly nervous that we may not get along, why I have no idea. 

I'm not looking for advice on what to do I am however hoping that some here have been in a similar situation and how it ended up?

TL;DR: Meeting girl for the first time after months of online/text chat. Anyone have similar experience? How did it go?

**Comments:**

* "I had a similar experience and it went great! We ended up dating for a few months and it was amazing. Just be yourself, be respectful, and don't overthink it. Remember that it's okay to be nervous, but try to relax and enjoy the experience."
* "I've been in a similar situation and it was a disaster. We met up and it was like we were complete strangers. I think the problem was that we had built up this idea of each other in our minds and it didn't match reality. Just be prepared for the possibility that it might not be what you expected."
* "I've had a few online relationships that ended up in person and they all went well. I think the key is to communicate openly and honestly with each other before meeting up. Make sure you both know what you're looking for and what your expectations are. And don't be afraid to be yourself - it's okay if you're not perfect!"
* "I'm a girl and I've been in a similar situation. I was nervous at first, but it ended up being a great experience. We ended up dating for a few months and it was really fun. Just remember that it's okay to be yourself and don't worry too much about what others think. And don't be afraid to ask questions and get to know each other better before meeting up."
* "I've been in a similar situation and it was a bit awkward at first, but we ended up having a great time. I think the key is to just relax and be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. And don't be afraid to laugh at yourself if things get awkward. It's okay to make mistakes and it's all part of the process."

TITLE: Cold applying for a marketing position in a small local company by attaching a proposal for their business website. Feasible idea?

POST: Hello /r/jobs, I graduated a few months ago and had no luck so far to get a job in marketing/sales. 

There's a small local company (perhaps 30 employees) but they are actually pretty successful in what they're doing (known worldwide). I checked their website and it's awful. Looks like a website from the early 2000's. So I guess they are not pretty good in (online-)marketing. 

I would like to do a cold application (not sure if they are looking for a marketing guy) but I had no luck with this kind of application in the past. That's why I thought I try something different. I have good skills in photoshop, indesign and illustrator. As a teenager I also built websites using HTML, so I thought I build a dummy website fitted to their company and attach some screenshots to my application.

What do you think? I this a feasible idea or will they be offended?

Thank you very much in advance.

TL;DR: Cold applying for a marketing position in a small local company by attaching a proposal for their business website. Feasible idea?

**Response from the community:**

* "I think it's a great idea! Showcasing your skills and creativity can be a great way to stand out from other applicants. Just make sure to keep it professional and not too flashy."
* "I agree, it's a good way to showcase your skills. Just be prepared for the possibility that they might not be interested in hiring someone who is trying to 'fix' their website."
* "I think it's a bit too bold, but it's worth a shot. Just make sure to include a brief explanation of why you chose to create a new website design and how it relates to their business goals."
* "I'm not sure if it's a good idea. They might see it as an attempt to 'fix' their website without their permission. Maybe try a more traditional approach first?"
* "I think it's a great idea! It shows that you're proactive and willing to take initiative. Just make sure to include a clear explanation of how your design can benefit their business."

**Conclusion:**

The community is generally supportive of the idea, but with some reservations. Some people think it's a great way to showcase skills and creativity, while others are concerned that it might be seen as too bold or an attempt to 'fix' the website without permission. It's recommended to include a brief explanation of why you chose to create a new website design and how it relates to their business goals, as well as being prepared for the possibility that they might not be interested in hiring someone who is trying to 'fix' their website. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide whether to pursue this approach or not.

TITLE: My boyfriend (34F) gave me an ultimatum, I realized it's a deal breaker for me(29F). He's still a good person and I'm lost on how to proceed with the breakup.

POST: We've been together three years. He has a degree (communications), tried to go back for another (more useful) one and got burnt out. He works a dead end job now, but is happy, which is important to me. But I'm also frustrated because I feel like I have more responsibilities in our relationship. I carry him on my insurance, pay for our car (which I do use more), make our house budget/cleaning chart and am trying to save up for a house for us.

For two years, he told me this job was temporary while he figured out which direction he wanted to go with his career. Last night he sat me down and told me he needed to give me an ultimatum (his words, "I don't mean it to be one, but it is"). He knows his job isn't what I want him to be doing but he's okay with it. He appreciates that I've been trying to support him figuring it out, but he's going to stop that and just live in the moment....for now. He knows himself and when he figures it out, he'll be passionate and dive in. 

At the time, I was relieved to hear him tell me straight up.....but after a night of sleep and a day to digest everything he said, the full weight is sinking in. This is a deal breaker for me. I respect his reasons (personal happiness is really important) and wish him well (he's a good person), but I've never been in this spot before. All my past relationships ended with fireworks, drama, tears.... this feels very "we both are in different places." 

Our lease is up at the end of June. Do I say something now? Wait until a month out? All these feelings just hit me on my lunch break and I'm starting to panic! I know it will be a hard breakup in the sense that we both love one another and neither did anything wrong, but that just knots my stomach even more! I don't want to make him feel guilty.

TL;DR: Boyfriend gave me an ultimatum to accept his current job situation or leave him. I realized it's a deal breaker for me, but I'm struggling with how to proceed with the breakup.

**Comments:**

* "It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires in a relationship. You deserve someone who is working towards their goals and aspirations, not just living in the moment. Don't feel guilty for wanting more out of life."

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] brokeup after 2.5 years this week and I'm having urges to start talking with her again

POST: Sorry in advance for the wall of text this seems to be! I didn't' mean for it.
Earlier this week, my ex dumped me because she said she couldn't be a good student (we are both in university) and a good girlfriend. Before this all happened we couldn't really see each other very much but we still texted and tried out best.

I've always been there for her and optimistic that we would find the time when we could to make the most of it. I drove her home from a weekend staying in our hometown and we try to figure things out but it ends up we break up and I'm heartbroken

I still drive her home and do my best but she sends me a long message saying that she can't bare to see pictures of me with friends or in a relationship so she deletes me. I'm confused about the whole situation but somehow talk myself into that it's for the best. 

The next day when I come home from school I see a bag on the doorstep. When I look inside its all the things I gave her through the time together. I was crushed. I felt betrayed, lonely, and couldn't understand what I did to deserve this. I quickly glance at her roommate's Facebook and see that they went out downtown and I think the worse. Of all the years I've known her, I've never seen her act like this.

Now that it has been some time I am doing better. I try not to look too much into what she is doing but I feel wrong and I have urges to at least Facebook her or say hey at school. I was wondering if anyone else could relate or provide some guidance.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend after 2.5 years, she broke up with me saying she couldn't balance school and relationship, I'm still heartbroken and have urges to reach out to her again.

**Comments:**

* OP, it's normal to feel the urge to reach out to your ex, especially when you're still grieving the loss of the relationship. However, it's important to remember that your ex has made it clear that she doesn't want to be in contact with you right now. It's possible that she needs space to focus on herself and her studies. Try to focus on your own healing and growth, and avoid reaching out to her for now.
* I can totally relate to this. I went through a similar situation with my ex, and I felt the same urges to reach out to her. But I realized that it was just a distraction from my own pain and that I needed to focus on myself. It's hard, but try to resist the urge to reach out to her for now. You deserve better than someone who doesn't want to be in contact with you.
* OP, I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and your relationship. It's clear that you cared deeply about your ex, and it's okay to acknowledge that. However, it's also important to recognize that your ex has made it clear that she doesn't want to be in contact with you. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things you learned from it, rather than dwelling on the negative.
* OP, I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own healing. It's okay to feel sad and heartbroken, but try not to dwell on the past. You deserve better than someone who doesn't want to be in contact with you. Try to focus on the present and the future, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family for support.

TITLE: Me [22F] and my boyfriend [21 M] dated for a year, he ended it two months ago and he's just now figured out that I'm "it"

POST: I'm a senior in college right now and my boyfriend and I had been dating for about a year when he ended it very abruptly about 2 months ago. With that it ended pretty explosively. The initial breakup was - as normal - upsetting but fine. Within days though he was pestering me via text and through mutual friends, constantly trying to get me to talk to him. Basically, when I went back to his place to get my stuff back, it ended in an extremely heated argument with lots of yelling on his end.

Fastforward 2 months and we've just gotten back from our separate spring breaks. I come home to a text from him saying that breaking up with me was the biggest mistake of his life and that he would like an opportunity to talk and a chance to prove his worth to me. We ended up talking for a long time during which we talked about what had happened during our relationship and he explained to me that he broke up with me because he was intimidated by the fact that I had a job so long before him and that there were some pretty bad problems going on at home that he felt he couldn't talk to me about.

We've been texting a little over the past few days since I said we could try being friends. Tonight though, I received a long text from him saying basically he would like to date me again because he has realized that I am "the one" and he wants a second chance.

So confused here, I have no idea what to do and I am feeling incredibly torn. Any advice would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 months ago, now he's saying he wants a second chance because he realizes I'm "the one" and he's willing to work on his issues. I'm torn and unsure what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's still not taking responsibility for his actions. He broke up with you because he was intimidated by your job and had personal issues, but now he's saying it was a mistake? That's not a healthy or mature way to approach a relationship. I would take a step back and re-evaluate whether you want to give him another chance."
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. If you're willing to work through his issues and give him another chance, that's one thing. But if you're still feeling hurt and upset, it might be better to focus on yourself and move on."
* "I'm a bit surprised he's saying he wants a second chance after how he treated you during the breakup. Did he apologize for his behavior during the breakup? If not, I think that's a major red flag. You deserve better than someone who can't even acknowledge their own mistakes."
* "I think you should consider what you want from a relationship. Do you want someone who is willing to work through their issues and grow with you, or do you want someone who is just going to make the same mistakes again? You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work."
* "I would say no. You deserve better than someone who is only realizing their feelings for you now that you're not with them. You deserve someone who is willing to work on themselves and communicate openly and honestly with you. Don't settle for someone who is only willing to do the bare minimum to get you back."

TITLE: Me [M17] and my girlfriend [F16] for 11 months fight and bicker over everything, how do we stop?

POST: Me and her fight over every single little thing you can think of, but they aren't huge arguments where we yell and scream at each other, but more of petty disagreements, that happen every day or every other day.

They have been going on for quite a while, but haven't always happened when we first started dating we got along great! We were always happy and never disagreed but past that, after about month 3 we started bickering about everything, however it is never in person only on the phone.

I am asking for advice on what to do, how to stop bickering, really at this point any advice is appreciated, we both agreed we can't continue doing this.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 11 months fight and bicker over every little thing, but only on the phone, how do we stop?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "It sounds like you both are having a hard time communicating effectively. Have you tried having a conversation about how you're feeling and what you want to change? Maybe you can set some ground rules for how you want to communicate with each other. Also, try to focus on the issue at hand instead of bringing up past grievances."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you both recognize that this isn't healthy and want to change. One thing that might help is to identify the underlying issues causing the bickering. Are you both stressed, anxious, or feeling overwhelmed? Once you identify the root cause, you can work together to find ways to manage those feelings and reduce the bickering."
3. **u/justanotheruser**: "I think it's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to change. One thing that might help is to set aside dedicated time to talk to each other without distractions. Maybe take a walk together, go out for coffee, or have a quiet dinner. This can help you both feel more connected and less likely to bicker."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "It sounds like you both are having a hard time with conflict resolution. Have you tried using active listening skills? When you're on the phone, try to really listen to what the other person is saying and respond thoughtfully. Also, try to avoid interrupting and stay calm. This can help reduce tension and create a more positive atmosphere for communication."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's also important to recognize that it's okay to disagree and have different opinions. It's not always necessary to 'win' an argument. Maybe you can try to find common ground and compromise instead of trying to 'prove' a point. This can help reduce the bickering and create a more positive atmosphere in your relationship."

TITLE: Is it really possible to meet the right person at the wrong time?

POST: This past October I (19F) met a really great guy (20M) through tinder. We went on a few dates here and there and got along really well.

However, we did run into some problems when it came to hanging out. If I had some free time, he would be working or in school (does both full time). And if he had free time I'd be in school or not home at the time (plus, I don't have my license yet so transportation was a factor too). This made it really difficult for us to hang out and see each other more. 

Today, we started talking on snapchat and he told me he doesn't think this can work anymore. I was crushed because I was really starting to like him and he even told me he had feelings for me as well. He said he just wants to work on himself for a while. I asked him if it's possible if things do work out in the future will he reconsider trying again. He didn't give me a straight answer saying it just depends on when it happens. 

So my question for you /r/relationships is it possible to meet the right person at the wrong time? And if yes, can things work out in the end? I'm really hurt right now and don't know how to feel because this has never happened to me before.

TL;DR: Met a guy on tinder, we got along great but had scheduling conflicts. He told me he doesn't think it can work and wants to focus on himself. I'm hurt and wondering if it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time and if things can work out in the future.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Yeah, it's definitely possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. Sometimes people need to focus on themselves before they can be ready for a relationship. It's not uncommon for people to need to work on themselves before they can be ready for someone else. It's not a reflection on you or him, it's just a timing thing.
2. **SarcasticSally**: I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's tough to hear that someone you liked doesn't think it can work out. But yeah, it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. Maybe he's not ready for a relationship right now, and that's okay. You'll find someone who is ready and willing to make time for you.
3. **RelationshipRookie**: I think it's great that you're asking yourself if it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. It's a great question! And the answer is yes, it's definitely possible. Sometimes people need to work on themselves before they can be ready for a relationship. It's not a reflection on you or him, it's just a timing thing.
4. **TinderTina**: I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's tough to hear that someone you liked doesn't think it can work out. But yeah, it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. Maybe he's not ready for a relationship right now, and that's okay. You'll find someone who is ready and willing to make time for you.
5. **RelationshipRenegade**: I think it's great that you're asking yourself if it's possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. It's a great question! And the answer is yes, it's definitely possible. Sometimes people need to work on themselves before they can be ready for a relationship. It's not a reflection on you or him, it's just a timing thing.

**Conclusion:** The comments are overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that it is possible to meet the right person at the wrong time. Many users agree that people need to work on themselves before they can be ready for a relationship, and that it's not a reflection on the individual or the relationship. The users also offer words of encouragement and support to the OP, telling her that she will find someone who is ready and willing to make time for her. The comments are a mix of empathy, understanding, and optimism, providing a supportive and reassuring environment for the OP.

TITLE: I'm pretty sure my boyfriend's (M22) girl friend (F21) has a crush on him. How do I handle it?

POST: Yesterday, my boyfriend had a pool party and invited a bunch of people.  I think one of the girls he's friends with has a crush on him.  As soon as I met her, I just knew.  I catch her staring at my boyfriend, teasing him in a flirty manner, and she laughs at *everything* he says.

At the pool party, she took it upon herself to let my boyfriend know that he was getting a little sunburned on his back.  Not even five minutes later, she was putting sunscreen on his back and rubbing/massaging his shoulders. 

She followed him around the entire time.  This girl has got it bad for my boyfriend.

Is there a good way to bring this up with him in a loving way?  We're in a five month relationship so it's not like we've been together that long.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's friend (F21) has a crush on him and I'm not sure how to bring it up with him.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's not your problem to handle. If your boyfriend is oblivious to her feelings, it's not your job to tell him. Just focus on your own relationship and let him figure it out on his own."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not your responsibility to police your boyfriend's relationships with his friends. If you're feeling insecure or uncomfortable, maybe have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling, but don't try to 'out' his friend or manipulate him into doing something."
* "I think it's worth having a conversation with your boyfriend about this. It's not about being jealous or controlling, it's about being honest and open with each other. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that [girl's name] seems to have a crush on you. I just want to make sure we're on the same page and that you're not feeling pressured or uncomfortable around her.'"
* "I would say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that [girl's name] seems to be really into you. I just want to make sure we're good and that you're not getting too caught up in it.' This way, you're expressing your concerns without being accusatory or jealous."
* "I think it's a good idea to talk to your boyfriend about this. It's not about being possessive, it's about being honest and open with each other. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that [girl's name] seems to have a crush on you. I just want to make sure we're on the same page and that you're not feeling pressured or uncomfortable around her.'"

This subreddit post and comments provide a range of perspectives on how to handle the situation. Some commenters suggest that it's not the OP's problem to handle and that they should focus on their own relationship. Others suggest that it's worth having a conversation with the boyfriend about the situation, but that it should be done in a non-accusatory and non-jealous way. The comments also highlight the importance of being honest and open with each other in a relationship. Overall, the post and comments demonstrate the complexity of navigating relationships and the importance of communication and trust.

TITLE: Made a mistake and need advice

POST: I have been seeing a friend and classmate for a while now (6 months) and I have taken her to numerous dinners. We always enjoy each others company and share the same interests. After our last dinner I told her that I havent been on a date in a real long time and was thinking about getting into the scene agian. She was obviously distressed because I am assuming she thought we were on dates this whole time. Anyways to make a long story short I ended up kissing her when leaving. It was real sudden and took her completely off gaurd. When I got home we talked on the phone and I admitted that I was unaware that the dinners we were on were dates. However I do like her and would like to continue seeing her and to make sure my actions were not crossing any lines. She said I didnt cross any lines. So, I asked her on another real date this tuesday and she agreed. This all happened on Thursday of last week. I texted her twice yesterday(Saturday) to which she didn't responed and recently tried to call her to make plans (amusement park) and she didn;t pick up nor return my call. I am wondering should I stop communication and let her figure out what she wants or send a text telling her I am sorry for how I did it, becuase I am not sorry I did kiss her. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Made a mistake by kissing a friend/classmate after telling her I wanted to get back into dating. She agreed to another date but hasn't responded to my texts/calls since Saturday. Should I stop communication or apologize?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* **Stop communication and let her figure it out**: Some users suggest that you should give her space and let her come to you if she wants to talk or continue seeing you. This can help her process her feelings and make a decision about what she wants.
* **Apologize for the way you did it, not the kiss itself**: Others recommend apologizing for the sudden and unexpected kiss, but not for the kiss itself. This shows that you're taking responsibility for your actions and are willing to make amends.
* **Communicate openly and honestly**: Some users suggest that you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and intentions. This can help clear the air and give her a better understanding of where you're coming from.
* **Respect her boundaries**: Remember to respect her boundaries and give her space if she needs it. Don't pressure her into talking or seeing you if she's not ready.
* **Be patient and don't overthink it**: Finally, some users suggest that you should be patient and not overthink the situation. Give her time to process her feelings and make a decision about what she wants. Don't assume the worst or jump to conclusions.

**OP'S FOLLOW-UP**

* **Update**: I decided to stop communication and give her space. I didn't want to pressure her into talking or seeing me if she wasn't ready. I also didn't want to make things worse by apologizing for the kiss itself. I'm just going to wait and see what she decides to do. Thanks for all the advice! I feel better knowing that I did the right thing.

TITLE: Me [34M] with my separated wife [33F] 14 years, why do i feel nothing?

POST: Quick run down of the relationship:

Whirlwind romance and 6 months later Married young (20 and 19 respectively), together for 14 years, 2 kids over the course of it. In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.

For a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to "evaluate her feelings", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of "us", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.

After a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical/mental affection (often not both at the same time).

Is this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?
Should i be open about my feelings and experiences (we made a clause on breakup, she didnt want to know anything i did with other people while we were separated, and told me to lie if i had done anything) or would that just end everything, and if it did is that for the best?

If someone could just live my life for me for a bit and give it back in a few months that would be grand :D

TL;DR: 14 year relationship ended due to my own issues and addictions. I begged and pleaded to get back together, but she needed time. We've had on-again-off-again contact since then. I've recently had a sexual experience with someone else and been on a date. I feel nothing towards my wife, only pity and exasperation. Is this normal? Should I be open about my feelings and experiences, or would that ruin everything? Should I just move on with my life? Help me out! :D

This post is a great example of a complex and nuanced relationship situation. The author is struggling to come to terms with his feelings and is seeking advice on how to move forward. The post is well-written and provides a clear overview of the situation, making it easy for readers to understand the context.

The author's feelings of pity and exasperation towards his wife are understandable, given the tumultuous nature of their relationship. It's also interesting to note that he has had a sexual experience with someone else, but it seems that this was a one-time thing and not a serious relationship.

The question of whether the author should be open about his feelings and experiences is a difficult one. On the one hand, being honest and transparent can be a healthy way to move forward and potentially repair the relationship. On the other hand, revealing his infidelity could potentially ruin the relationship and cause harm to his wife.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to be open about his feelings and experiences is a personal one that the author must make for himself. It's important to consider the potential consequences of his actions and to prioritize his own well-being and happiness.

In terms of whether the author is "normal" for feeling nothing towards his wife, it's difficult to say. Everyone experiences relationships differently, and it's common for people to feel a range of emotions during and after a breakup. The author's feelings of pity and exasperation are understandable, given the circumstances of their relationship.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities of relationships and the challenges that people face when trying to navigate them. It's a relatable and thought-provoking post that encourages readers to reflect on their own relationships and the emotions that come with them.

TITLE: I'm a [23 M] and coincidentally met a great [21 F] girl over the weekend. The problem? She lives far away. Help me out Reddit!

POST: Over this weekend I was able to meet a remarkable girl. Pretty much from the get go it was obvious that at least I was interested (I drunkenly gave her a flower at a cocktail party to start off our first conversation), but she also ended up hanging out with me the next night as well at my house, albeit with her friend. She knows I have a crush on her. I know she is interested in me at the least as a friend, but I am not fully confident if she is interested as anything more (we've only met a couple days, I'm about 60-70% sure she's interested in me beyond friendship - I thought I heard her asking her friend if it was okay to sleep over at my place but I'm not sure).

I don't have a problem with LDRs provided they are serious but to be honest, I have my own life and school to focus on now anyway. I don't think I want a relationship as of the current moment. I'm more interested in down the road - this is the first girl that I met that is astoundingly pretty, captivating, and is part of my exact same culture (families are pretty much the exact same which I value a lot). Practically speaking, it's perfect material for a serious relationship save for the fact that she lives far away. Which pretty much renders the whole thing impractical as of the moment.

I want to continue talking to her but I'm not sure where or how to gear the relationship. I'd like to get to know her better but also be in a place in the future where she knows I'm (likely) seriously interested and I can figure out if she is seriously interested in a relationship. 

I know I've only met her a couple days, but I've just got a feeling on this one...

TL;DR: Met a great girl over the weekend, but she lives far away. I'm interested in getting to know her better, but I'm not sure how to navigate the situation. Help me out Reddit!

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, it sounds like you're trying to play it cool and not scare her off, but honestly, just be upfront with her. Tell her how you feel and what you're looking for. If she's interested, she'll let you know. If not, at least you'll know where you stand. Don't waste time playing games or trying to gauge her interest. Just be yourself and be honest."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, you're 23 and she's 21. You're basically a grown man and she's still in her early 20s. Don't you think you should be focusing on your own life and goals before getting into a relationship? I'm not saying it's impossible, but you're putting a lot of pressure on this girl to be your partner in the future. Maybe take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit?"
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "OP, I think you're being too cautious. If you're interested in her, just be honest and tell her. It's okay if she's not interested, but at least you'll know. And who knows, maybe she's interested in you too! Don't let fear of rejection hold you back. Just be yourself and see where things go."
4. **LongDistanceLurker**: "OP, I've been in LDRs before and it's tough. But if you're serious about getting to know her better, you should start making plans to visit her or have her visit you. It's not ideal, but it's better than just talking online. And who knows, maybe you'll find a way to make it work in the long run."
5. **CynicalChris**: "OP, you're 23 and you're already thinking about the future? You're not even out of your 20s yet! Just enjoy the moment and don't worry about what could be. You're putting too much pressure on this girl and on yourself. Just relax and see where things go."

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell while driving

POST: I'll start from this morning. It was a normal day for me. I woke up at around 7:30 as I usually do so I could wake up and get to work on time. I did so, worked my 8 hours, clocked in, clocked out. My coworkers wanted to go out to get something to eat, but I wasn't feeling social today, so I passed and walked to my car.

However, I was feeling rather hungry. I'm currently on a diet, but I've been on it for a rather long time (around 6 months) so I had forgotten what the taste of a deliciously disgusting Taco Bell taco tasted like. Once I started thinking about it, I couldn't stop so I set my course to the nearest Taco Bell about 15 minutes away.

After driving for a bit I finally reached my destination. I pulled up to the drive-thru, placed my order for 2 tacos, a crunchwrap and a large Mountain Dew. I pulled up to the next window, paid for my order, and sat the bag of food on the passenger seat next to me. I checked my phone to see what time it was, and determined that I had enough time to eat in a parking space and be home in time for my family. 

Let's just say I fucking ravaged those first 2 tacos. I scarfed them down like I've never seen what a scrap of food looked like before. As I'm about to move onto my crunchwrap, I get a phonecall from my wife asking where I am.

"You're at Taco Bell?! You said you'd drive Caitlyn (our daughter) to soccer practice!"

Shit. I hung up the phone and stepped on the gas with one hand on the wheel and another on my crunchwrap. I was doing 70 on the highway trying to rush back to get my daughter there on time. 

But that crunchwrap was way to delicious. I was paying too much attention to the deliciousness, the amazingness, the...

I felt a thud. My windshield cracked. I pulled over and stepped out of my car to what was the remains of a now dead deer and a busted windshield along with other damages to my car. Caitlyn was late to practice.

TL;DR: I ate Taco Bell while driving, got a call from my wife, and got into an accident with a deer.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author's decision to eat Taco Bell while driving led to a series of unfortunate events, including getting into an accident with a deer and being late to pick up their daughter from soccer practice. The post is relatable, entertaining, and serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of distracted driving. The author's use of humor and self-deprecation makes the post even more enjoyable to read. The subreddit r/tifu is a great place to share stories like this, as it provides a platform for people to share their own mistakes and mishaps, and to commiserate with others who have had similar experiences.

TITLE: Me [18F] with the guy [24~M] I've been seeing for a month, not sure if i should mention him to my judgmental family at Easter.

POST: I'm very happy with this guy so far, we've been getting along great. We've got good communication and we're on the same page about where we are and where we see things going. 

This weekend he's meeting my family, but just my parents and siblings. He's also invited me over to meet his family for a while on Easter, which i'm very excited about. 

However, I'm also going to be spending part of Easter with my extended family. Many of these relatives tend to be somewhat judgmental and disapproving of my relationships. Not the *people* I date, but how many people I've dated, and that I put these relationships on facebook (because "people can see how many people you date, and might think you're promiscuous"). I've had my fair share of relationships, but never more than 2 in one year. 

I originally wanted to hold off on talking about him until things got more serious, hoping that my family would take me more seriously. However, I also don't want to appear ashamed of him, or like I'm trying to hide him. I appriciate that he has been so open about me meeting his family, and want to be able to share my family with him too.

TL;DR: Should I mention my boyfriend to my judgmental family at Easter, or wait until things get more serious?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, I think it's better to be upfront and honest with your family. They might be more understanding than you think, and it's better to get it out of the way now rather than having them find out later and feeling like you're hiding something. Just be prepared for some potential judgment and criticism, but also be confident in your relationship and the person you're dating."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's better to be upfront and honest. You can always explain to your family that you're not trying to hide him, but you're just taking things slow and getting to know each other better. And who knows, they might even surprise you and be more accepting than you think!"
* "I think it's a good idea to wait until things get more serious. You don't want to rush into introducing him to your family, especially if they're judgmental. You want to make sure you're both on the same page and that your relationship is stable before bringing him into the mix. Just be honest with your family and tell them that you're taking things slow and getting to know each other better."
* "I think you should introduce him to your family, but also be prepared for some potential backlash. You can't control how others react, but you can control how you react to it. Just be confident in your relationship and the person you're dating, and don't let anyone else's opinions dictate how you feel about yourself or your relationship."

Overall, the comments are advising the OP to be honest and upfront with their family, but also to be prepared for potential judgment and criticism. Some comments suggest waiting until things get more serious, while others encourage the OP to introduce their boyfriend to their family and deal with any potential backlash. The comments are generally supportive and encouraging, with a focus on the importance of being honest and confident in one's relationship.

TITLE: A little help please?

POST: So, I've been in a relationship with my (now ex) girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years and it just ended suddenly tonight. I guess it was because of a lot of stuff that's been building up throughout our relationship. It is long distance because I'm away at college so I definitely understand why things went sour. For clarification, I broke up with her. She was fairly controlling throughout our relationship and was also extremely clingy. I never really got any appreciation for the stuff I did for her and she is also an extremely jealous person. I'm the only person that she has to rely on when she needs someone and she expects me to be at her side at the drop of a hat. We had different views on a lot of things, including religion, marriage, and children, but we were extremely serious and considering engagement in the future. Fiscally, she wasn't really appropriate for me because she is a rather large spender while I prefer to save our money. Unfortunately, I would give in on these whims and now I don't really have much to show for working throughout my high school career. Although things haven't been that good for us when we are away from one another, they are typically really good when we are together. After breaking up with her, she told me that she was going to change everything that I dislike about her because she had figured all of this out already and was wanting to fix it before anything bad happened. I told her that it was a little too late because these problems have come up before and they were never fixed, but she insisted that she would keep trying she also said that she hopes that we can get back together some time in the future. I really don't know how to handle the situation, Reddit. Can you help me out? Do I stay friends with her? Do I give her another chance? Do I try to experience more of the college lifestyle and meet other girls and date them? Any advice you can offer is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years due to her controlling, clingy, and jealous behavior. She's now saying she wants to change and we can get back together in the future. I'm unsure what to do. Should I stay friends, give her another chance, or focus on myself and meet new people?

TITLE: Just finished A Thousand Splendid Suns. The end kicked my ass. Reddit, what  moments in literature/film have overwhelmed you?

POST: SPOILER ALERT: I loved A Thousand Splendid Suns. Read it in 3 days. It was a page turner, for sure. At the end, when she puts the tape in, and it's Pinocchio, and she has no idea why... I threw the book across the room and bawled like I haven't since my best friend died. I don't know why.. Everything came rushing back. I thought about where I'd been, where I'm going.. I thought about all the amazing people in the world who will be forgotten. I thought about how cruel I've been, and how selfish. I thought about how people in the world are suffering while I am sitting in America. I thought about too many things at once, and it took me a good 15 minutes to come down from that emotional high. Truly one of the greatest moments of my literary history.

So reddit... I'd like to know, what moments in literature, film, comics, tv, etc.. have had an emotional impact on you? Preferably something that you weren't expecting. Something simple, something complex, something obscure, something famous. I want to know, what are the most gut wrenching, heart warming, enlightening, wonderful, awful twists (yes, I said it) that human minds have ever conceived of. What's made your hair stand on end, your heart drop into your stomach, your eyes swell up, a lump form in your throat, choked you up, made you shout "NO." The only think I ask of you is to put the title at the top so that if we haven't seen/read it, we know not to look at the comment.

TL;DR: A Thousand Splendid Suns just destroyed me. What are the most emotional moments in literature, film, etc. that have affected you? Share your stories!

TITLE: Hi Reddit. I said something inappropriate around my family. Please tell me what YOU said. HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH BEING BANISHED FROM THE FAMILY?

POST: Tonight I was at dinner with my dad and step mom. My dad is way older than my step mom. 
I asked my step mom if she married my dad while she was in college or before she started college.
My brother replied for her and said "while she was in elementary school". As a joke and everyone laughed.
I got excited because I...I'm lame and something inappropriate slipped out...
Along the lines of....my dad having a white van....hiding candy in it.....driving around schools....doing things....it got worse as I kept talking.
I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. It's like I don't have a filter. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
Anyway, everyone just exchanged awkward glances and my brother said "wow, sometimes you shouldn't be invited to dinner." 
And my step mom said I was "disgusting". 
I decided to just  be quiet the whole night and eat lots of cheesecake. I don't know if I could have said something to fix the situation.

TL;DR: I said something inappropriate at dinner and my family is mad at me. Please tell me what you said and how you dealt with being banished from the family.

TITLE: Do I move back in with my boyfriend?

POST: I'm a 22/F with a 23/M and we've been together for 2.5 years. Our relationship is loving and happy, and due to the fact that we live approximately 45 minutes away from each other (both living with our parents [embarrassing, but resources we're lucky to have]) have to restrict our visits to about 2 days a week. 

We did the 2 days a week for a year and a half, then we got an apartment together for 6 months. When we lived together life was wonderful, and I couldn't ask for better. Due to various financial difficulties compounded by extreme family crises, we both moved back to our parents' homes until the crises were dealt with and we had enough saved up to move out again. The time to move out of my parents' house is coming up,  I'm unsure if when I move back out it should be with him.

It has always been extremely important to me that I live by myself for at least a year, at some (relatively early) point in my adult life. My mom drilled in to me that you must learn to be alone in order to function well within relationships, and I think at this point I would feel like I had missed out on something major if I didn't experience living on my own soon. 

I've talked about this with my boyfriend and he understands/encourages me to do what I need to do, but I don't want to move without him. So much of my relationship with him has been spent with strict limits on time that when the opportunity arises to live with him again I know I won't want to say "No". Plus, it just seems like a huge economic waste for us both to be paying for an apartment, Internet, etc. etc., when we could just be splitting the bill (our low incomes plays a role in my trepidation as well), when he moves to the same city I'm moving to.

TL;DR: I'm unsure if I should move back in with my boyfriend when I move out of my parents' house. I want to live on my own for a bit, but I also don't want to miss out on the opportunity to live with him again and the economic benefits of splitting the bill.

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma many people face in their relationships. The OP (original poster) is torn between her desire to live on her own for a bit and her desire to live with her boyfriend again. She's already experienced living together once before, but now she's considering moving back in with him, despite her initial reservations about living with him again.

The OP is seeking advice from the community on whether she should move back in with her boyfriend or not. She's already discussed this with her boyfriend, and he understands and encourages her to do what she needs to do, but she's still unsure.

The post highlights the importance of considering one's own needs and desires in a relationship, as well as the need for open and honest communication with one's partner. It also touches on the economic benefits of living together, which can be a significant factor in many people's decisions.

The community's response to this post is likely to be varied, with some people advising the OP to prioritize her own needs and desires, while others may suggest that living with her boyfriend again could be a positive experience for both of them. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the OP's individual circumstances and what she feels is best for her relationship and her own personal growth.

TITLE: Ex (30/f) of 2 years and I (27/m) broke up a few months ago. I really do love her but she won't tell me she does.

POST: I know I'm going to get some crappy replies to this but I'm sucking up and I'm going to take it on the chin. 

For the past year, I used my ex as an emotional punchbag. I have been going through issues which have left myself emotionally unable to stop myself from saying things and blowing up out of proportion. I was recently diagnosed with bpd which I was worried about and basically, I used her as that emotional punchbag for a year before we split. 

I have since come to terms with the fact that I completely cocked up, pushed her away and used her for my problems. I have really felt bad about it and I have told her I love her. She doesn't say anything back but I know that when she hears it, she changes her attitude for the better. 

I really want to get back with her and put this behind us. I know there's something still there even if the chances are small. I would jump at the opportunity no matter how small to show that I have come to terms with who I am and what is wrong with me. I know if we can get over this, we'll be stronger than ever and ready to take on the world. She really is the love of my life. I know everyone says it but it's true. I've never loved someone as much as I 

Any advice on what to do would be much appreciated and how to approach, what seems to be, this thorny subject.

TL;DR: Ex (30/f) and I (27/m) broke up 3 months ago after I used her as an emotional punchbag for a year. I have since come to terms with my BPD and want to get back with her. She doesn't say she loves me back, but I know she has feelings for me. How do I approach this and what advice can you give me?

---

**Top comments:**

* "OP, I'm glad you're taking responsibility for your actions and acknowledging your BPD. That's a huge step. However, you need to understand that your ex may not be ready to forgive and forget. You can't force her to say she loves you back or to take you back. You need to focus on becoming the best version of yourself and see if she's willing to work on the relationship. Don't pressure her or guilt trip her into staying with you."
* "I think you're being a bit too optimistic about the situation. You used your ex as an emotional punchbag for a year, and that's not something that can be easily forgotten. You need to give her space and time to process her feelings and figure out what she wants. Don't expect her to just forgive and forget because you've 'come to terms' with your BPD. You need to prove to her that you're committed to changing and growing as a person."
* "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself and your ex. You can't force someone to love you back or to take you back. You need to focus on becoming the best version of yourself and see if she's willing to work on the relationship. Don't be too hard on yourself if she doesn't want to take you back. You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on getting your ex back. You need to focus on becoming the best version of yourself and see if she's willing to work on the relationship. Don't put all your eggs in one basket and assume that she'll take you back just because you've 'come to terms' with your BPD. You need to be open to the possibility that she may not want to take you back, and that's okay."
* "OP, I think you're being a bit too optimistic about the situation. You used your ex as an emotional punchbag for a year, and that's not something that can be easily forgotten. You need to give her space and time to process her feelings and figure out what she wants. Don't expect her to just forgive and forget because you've 'come to terms' with your BPD.

TITLE: Me [18 F] with my Boyfriend [26 M] 8 months, my sex drive is bigger than his

POST: I've been dating Boyfriend for about 8 months, and this isn't a huge problem or a deal breaker. I love him a lot and we have plans on marrying when I'm done with university. Unfortunately, this has been a problem for a long while now, and it's really been getting troublesome these past couple days.

See, the more time goes on, the more sex I want to have with him. I see sex as one of the few ways that I feel close to him. For him, though, sex is just an extra thing to do with the person he loves. Which is fine, except that there are days when he's just too tired to do things. And while I respect that, those also happen to be the days where I see him the least, which makes me want to feel close to him even more. It hurts to be turned down, and it hurts him to hurt me, and it hurts me to hurt him, so on and so forth. While its only been this difficult these past couple of days, we both agree that this is kind of a problem that should be resolved sooner rather than be held off.

My position is to change, and that it's my own problem that I have to deal with. He doesn't think I should, though, and that there's some middle ground that we can reach that works. I'm really not sure what to do. Masturbation doesn't really work, and forcing him to put out is not an option.

TL;DR: My sex drive is bigger than my boyfriend's, and it's causing tension in our relationship. I want to find a way to make it work, but I'm not sure what to do.

This post is a great example of a relationship problem that is not necessarily a "problem" in the classical sense, but rather a difference in desire and approach to intimacy. The OP is struggling to find a solution that works for both her and her boyfriend, and is seeking advice from the community.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the issue. The OP is open and honest about her feelings and desires, and is willing to listen to advice and suggestions from others. The tone of the post is not accusatory or blaming, but rather seeking a solution that works for both parties.

The community's response to this post is likely to be varied, with some people offering advice and suggestions, while others may share their own experiences and perspectives. Some possible responses might include:

* Advice on how to communicate with your partner about your desires and needs
* Suggestions for finding alternative ways to connect and feel close to your partner
* Encouragement to focus on other aspects of the relationship that are working well
* Personal anecdotes and experiences that may be relevant to the issue

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for people to share their relationship struggles and seek advice and guidance.

TITLE: My bf [23] doesn't speak of his childhood, but I[f22] know he's traumatized.

POST: We were friends for 10 years, before we got together. He than told me once about his terrible childhood. (He told only 3 of his friends his story)

Now we're a couple for quite a few months and well, sometimes there's stuff I know that reminds him of his childhood, but it's like he's forgotten that he had told me. So he keeps pretending that nothing happened.

Some examples
Lately we were watching an old TVshow, that every child watched when we're young, like Sesamestreet, and he couldn't remember a thing. (Which I think is because he forced himself to forget everything.)
He likes christmas, but only the food, not the stuff with Santa, and he hates to get presents. (Which is the thing childs like the most about christmas.)
And stuff like watching TVshows about raising children. We talk about how we're going to raise ours in the future and that we won't will be as horrible as the parents on TV. (But striking, the things he thinks are important are always the things his parents should have done, to save him from the traumatizing stuff.)

I know he likes to put his problems far away. But on the other hand, I'm his girlfriend now and we're pretty serious, isn't it good to speak about it maybe just once, so he knows I know his secret/won't tell, and most of all, I'm always there for him?

What do you think?

TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn't speak about his childhood, but I know he's traumatized. He's pretending it never happened. I want him to open up and talk about it, but he's not willing. What should I do?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, it's great that you care about your boyfriend's well-being, but you need to respect his boundaries. He's clearly not ready to talk about his childhood, and forcing him to do so could push him further away. Instead, focus on being a supportive partner and let him know that you're there for him when he's ready to open up.
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: OP, it's understandable that you want to support your boyfriend, but you need to prioritize his comfort level. If he's not ready to talk about his childhood, don't push him to do so. Instead, focus on building a strong and healthy relationship based on trust, communication, and mutual respect.
3. **concernedfriend**: OP, I'm a friend of a guy who went through similar trauma, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for people to suppress their memories and emotions. It's great that you're trying to be supportive, but you need to be patient and understanding. It may take time for him to open up, and you need to respect his pace.
4. **trauma survivor**: OP, I'm a survivor of childhood trauma, and I can tell you that it's not easy to talk about. It's great that you're trying to be supportive, but you need to be prepared for the possibility that your boyfriend may not be ready to talk about it. Instead, focus on building a strong and healthy relationship based on trust, communication, and mutual respect.
5. **relationship coach**: OP, it's great that you're trying to be supportive, but you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you're feeling frustrated or upset because your boyfriend isn't opening up, it may be helpful to seek counseling or therapy to work through your emotions. Remember that you can't force someone to talk about their trauma, but you can focus on building a strong and healthy relationship based on trust, communication, and mutual respect.

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are generally supportive and understanding, with many users advising the OP to prioritize her boyfriend's comfort level and boundaries. Some users also suggest seeking counseling or therapy to work through her own emotions and build a strong and healthy relationship. Overall, the comments provide a helpful and supportive perspective on the situation.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21] of 2 years wants to get blackout drunk at parties, I [M 23] am not comfortable with this.

POST: Hey everyone, my girlfriend doesn't go out a lot but when she does start drinking she has a hard time stopping and goes too far and gets black out drunk. She has promised me on multiple occasions that she wasn't going to over do it with the drinking but still drank way too much. As her boyfriend, I feel uncomfortable when she is that intoxicated around other guys because she is vulnerable and her friends have proven in the past that they don't look out for her if she gets into a bad situation. 

Am I being a crazy, over protective boyfriend for not wanting her to get so drunk at parties, concerts, etc.? What could be a solution that is fair to her?

TL;DR: Girlfriend gets blackout drunk at parties, I'm uncomfortable with it, feel like I'm being a crazy boyfriend for not wanting her to do it.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "You're not being a crazy boyfriend, you're being a responsible one. It's understandable that you're worried about her safety and well-being. Have you talked to her about how you feel? Maybe she's not aware of how her behavior is affecting you."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I agree with the previous comment. Communication is key. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. It's possible she's not aware of how her drinking is affecting you and may be willing to make changes."
3. **u/PartyAnimal**: "Dude, chill out. She's 21, she can handle her drink. You're being too controlling. Let her live her life."
4. **u/ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm a bit surprised by the negative comments. As a society, we should be promoting responsible drinking and looking out for each other's well-being. The OP is being a responsible partner and friend by expressing his concerns."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think the OP is being reasonable. It's not about controlling his girlfriend, it's about being concerned for her safety. Maybe they can find a compromise, like setting a limit on how much she drinks or having a plan in place for getting home safely."
6. **u/BlackoutBride**: "I've been in similar situations before and I can understand why the OP is worried. It's not fun being in a situation where you're not in control of your actions. Maybe the girlfriend can try to pace herself or have a drink limit set before going out."
7. **u/PartyPooper**: "I think the OP is being a bit too uptight. It's just a party, let her have fun. If she's old enough to drink, she's old enough to make her own decisions."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are mixed, with some people agreeing with the OP's concerns and others feeling that he's being too controlling. The majority of the comments suggest that communication and finding a compromise are key to resolving the issue. The post highlights the importance of considering the well-being and safety of one's partner, as well as the need for open and honest communication in relationships.

TITLE: I (20 F) had a MissCarriage with my (25 M) BF a year ago, I feel EMPTY and, I want to try to have a baby. he doesn't. Advice?

POST: When i was 16 i had an abortion with my ex boyfriend. 
living with guilt, 
two years later my boyfriend (23 M) and i (18 F) (being together for a year or so) at the time ended up being pregnant.
At first he wanted to have an abortion. 
I could not live with myself if i would have agreed to do so.
2 months pass by and we have never been so in love. it was the holiday season and on christmas eve i began to bleed. i went to the ER and the doctors told me everything was fine and sent me home. (i saw a sonogram that day) Also that day he was not present due to being at work,
the day after christmas, i misscarried.
i have never felt so empty in my life.
i am sad whenever i see a baby, or an infant 
I want to have a child, but whenever i tell him he just says "not right now" or "maybe when i'm 30"
we have been together for about 2.5 years now. But this may be a deal breaker for me because of how i feel and how much i love him and want him to have my children.

TL;DR: I had a miscarriage with my boyfriend a year ago, and I'm still feeling empty and want to have a baby. He doesn't want to, and I'm not sure if I can continue the relationship if he doesn't change his mind.

TITLE: Me (28F) with my (32F) sister. She has been struggling to get pregnant for well over a year. My husband and I started trying and I'm pregnant within the month. How can I approach this with sensitivity without overthinking everything?

POST: Hi reddit! I've created this new account for anonymity. 

My sister and I have a good relationship despite living half way around the world from one another. I recently found out I was pregnant and figured I shouldn't overthink it and just tell her as I would have told her in the past (before knowing about her visits with fertility doctors etc). She responded very sweetly and is texting me asking several excited questions and there doesn't seem to be any weirdness at all. She seems genuinely thrilled that I'm going to be a mum!

However, I'm still a little worried and overthinking things in my head. I am worried that deep down she is sad and how I should best respect her feelings without making it an issue. The fertility issues she is having would have stayed between her and her husband had it not been for an awkward visit with my mother. My mum visited her (my parents also live in a different country.) and she had to tell my mum because there were so many secret appointments etc. My mum is not the most tactful person and rather than understand it was a private issue just got incredibly excited they were trying, to the point that when she left their house she left a note and candles in their bedroom wishing them luck. Cringe. So my sister and I have been bonding over how cheesy our mum is being.

I'm looking for advice on how to go forward. Should I just pretend that everything is normal and follow her cues? Should I be more sensitive about the subject because of what she is going through?

I can't help but feel guilty. I wasn't going to share with her how long we were trying but when she asked I couldn't lie to her. I feel awful that I got to tell the family happy news before she could. I feel guilty as a little sister to be pregnant before my big sister who deserves it so much. I started trying because it's the right time in my life but I was prepared for it to take much longer! I can't help but wish I had waited a little longer until she could have her moment.

TL;DR: I'm 28F and just found out I'm pregnant. My 32F sister has been struggling to get pregnant for over a year. I'm worried about how to approach this with sensitivity without overthinking everything. Should I just pretend everything is normal or be more sensitive about the subject?

**Community Response:**

The community responds with a mix of advice and reassurance. Many users suggest being honest and open with your sister, while also being sensitive to her feelings.

**Top Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your sister's feelings! It's natural to feel guilty, but try not to beat yourself up over it. Just be honest with your sister and let her know how you're feeling. She might appreciate your openness and honesty." - u/throwaway123456
* "I think you should focus on your own pregnancy and not worry too much about how your sister might feel. You can't control how others react, but you can control how you react to the situation. Just be happy for yourself and your growing family!" - u/happyfamily
* "I think it's great that you're considering your sister's feelings! It's always good to be considerate of others, especially when it comes to something as personal as getting pregnant. Just be honest with your sister and let her know how you're feeling. She might appreciate your openness and honesty." - u/sisterlylove
* "I think you should have a conversation with your sister about your concerns and feelings. It's always better to be open and honest with each other, especially when it comes to something as personal as getting pregnant. Just be honest with your sister and let her know how you're feeling. She might appreciate your openness and honesty." - u/conversationstarter

**Conclusion:**

The community responds with a mix of advice and reassurance, suggesting that being honest and open with your sister is the best approach. Many users recommend focusing on your own pregnancy and not worrying too much about how your sister might feel. The top comments suggest that being considerate of your sister's feelings is important, but not to beat yourself up over it. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your relationship with your sister and how you communicate with each other.

TITLE: A friend from my old high school asked me to prom, but I really would rather not go.

POST: I'm a freshman in college and a friend of mine texted me last week and asked if I would be her back up date to her senior prom. I explained that I would be getting my wisdom teeth out at the end of May, and I very well may not be able to go so I can't promise anything, so I would have to be her backup.

However, a guy in her grade asked her and she really didn't want to go with him, so she made up this story about how she was trying to work something out with a guy from the next town over, but I was her back up in case it didn't 

She asked me if I would be cool going with her because if she went with someone else from her grade it would look bad. What should I say to her? I actually might be getting my wisdom teeth out during that time so I don't know. I don't want to leave her hanging but I've been to six proms and I think I've had my fill.

TL;DR: Friend from old high school asked me to be her backup date to prom, but I really don't want to go. I'm not sure if I'll be able to go due to getting wisdom teeth out. What should I say to her?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* "Honestly, just be upfront with her. Tell her you appreciate the ask, but you're not really interested in going to prom again. If she's really in a bind, you could offer to help her find someone else or give her some advice on how to get out of it. But don't feel obligated to go if you don't want to."
* "I would say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the ask, but I'm not really feeling up for prom this year. I've been to a few in the past and I'm good for now.' Don't make up an excuse or lead her on, just be honest and direct."
* "If you're really concerned about leaving her hanging, you could offer to help her find someone else or give her some advice on how to get out of it. But at the end of the day, it's her problem, not yours. You don't owe her a prom date just because she asked."
* "I would say 'Hey, I appreciate the ask, but I'm not really interested in going to prom this year. I've got some personal stuff going on and I need to focus on that. Maybe we can catch up another time?' This way you're not saying no to the prom specifically, but you're still being honest about your priorities."
* "Just be honest and direct. You don't have to sugarcoat it or make up an excuse. You can say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the ask, but I'm not really interested in going to prom this year. I've been to a few in the past and I'm good for now.' Don't make her feel bad or guilty for asking, just be clear and direct."

TITLE: TIFU by water skiing and tubing all weekend

POST: I spent the whole weekend at my buddy's lake house with a few friends, most of which was out on the boat. Now, this was my first time at a lake house and doing all these cool lake house things. I was dying to wakeboard/water ski since I am big into skateboarding and longboarding. I assumed that I'd pick it up pretty quickly considering my experience in other balance related activities. And what do you know, I did pretty well. We took turns on the skis and also battled it out on tubes as well. 
However the fuck up comes in this entire week because I did *not* take into account the muscle strength it takes to hold on for your fucking life when being dragged behind a boat like that. And we were out there all damn day. So I've barely had the muscle strength in my forearms to grip just about anything. Opening the fridge? Nope, grabbing my backpack? Fucking nope. Anything requiring flexing my fingers? Absolutely not. It's been almost a week and it's finally getting to the point where I can function normally again.

TL;DR: Spent the whole weekend water skiing and tubing, didn't realize how much strength it takes, now my forearms are still recovering and I'm struggling to do simple tasks.

COMMENT 1:
Dude, I feel you. I did the same thing last summer and I was like "oh, I'm a pro at this" and then I woke up the next day and couldn't even hold a coffee cup. It's like your forearms are saying "hey, we're not made for this kind of abuse"

COMMENT 2:
I did this once and I thought I was gonna die. I was holding on for dear life and my arms were screaming at me. I ended up with a bunch of bruises and a serious case of "I'll never do that again". But hey, at least you got to experience it, right?

COMMENT 3:
I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to water sports, but I've done some wakeboarding and it's crazy how much strength it takes. I ended up with a bunch of sore muscles and I couldn't even lift my arms for a few days. But hey, it was worth it, right?

COMMENT 4:
I'm a bit of a fitness enthusiast and I've done some strength training, but even I was surprised by how much strength it takes to water ski. I ended up with some serious soreness in my forearms and shoulders, but it was a great workout. Maybe next time I'll be able to do it without feeling like I'm going to die

COMMENT 5:
I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to water sports, but I've done some wakeboarding and it's crazy how much strength it takes. I ended up with a bunch of sore muscles and I couldn't even lift my arms for a few days. But hey, it was worth it, right?

This post and the comments that follow highlight the importance of understanding the physical demands of a new activity, especially one that requires strength and endurance. The OP (original poster) underestimated the amount of strength needed to hold on while water skiing and tubing, and as a result, suffered from sore and weak forearms. The comments from other users who have experienced similar situations offer words of encouragement and advice, reminding the OP that it's normal to feel sore and weak after engaging in a new physical activity. The post also serves as a cautionary tale for others who may be considering trying water sports for the first time. (Source: Reddit)...read more

TITLE: friend zone: not sure if the girl i like has attraction to me

POST: His, 

I have known that girl for over 3 years and it's only a year ago that I understood that I am very attracted to her, more than just a friend. In the meantime she has gotten a boyfriend and i really don't know how to act now. 

What worsens things is that I am pretty shy and nerdy, and since more reactive than initiative. She is the type of girl though who expects initiative in a relationship. 

I told her about my feelings and we have never touched this theme since. The furtherst we've gone physically is holding each other's hands and hugging but I am not sure if it's more a courtesy of friendship. She did mention that she is not that much satisfied with her current relationship, though she tries avoiding exclusive hang-outs with me inviting others because "it's more fun".

I am not sure what would be the best way to go now. Most of all I want to  know if she has some deeper feelings to me. The reason is that I would hate ruining our friendship by pushing too far. But how could I find it out, revealing it in a conversation is not an option since it would be too selfish and I guess she is equally unsure about my intentions. And I think that staying by friends and seeing what happens   I will just be locked in the friend zone.

TL;DR: I have feelings for a girl who has a boyfriend, I told her but she hasn't responded, I'm unsure if she has feelings for me, and I don't know how to proceed without ruining our friendship.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you gotta take a step back and focus on yourself. You can't keep waiting for her to make a move or give you signs. You need to take initiative and show her that you're interested. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and open up to her, but also don't put all your eggs in one basket. Keep your options open and don't get too attached to the idea of being with her. Remember, you deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you, not just a friend."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and see where things go. If she's not interested, then so be it. You can't force someone to feel a certain way. And if she is interested, then you'll know it. Don't put too much pressure on the situation and just enjoy the friendship for now."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about your feelings. It's better to be honest and upfront than to keep it bottled up inside. You never know, she might be feeling the same way and is just too afraid to say anything. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way and be okay with that. You can't force someone to feel a certain way, but you can be honest and respectful about your feelings."
* "I think you're being too focused on the idea of being in a relationship with her. Maybe you should try to get to know her better as a person, outside of the context of a romantic relationship. See if you have any common interests or hobbies that you can bond over. This might help you build a stronger connection with her and see if there's a possibility of something more in the future."
* "I think you should try to take a break from thinking about her and focus on yourself. You can't control how others feel, but you can control how you feel. Try to focus on your own interests and hobbies and see where that takes you. You might find that you're happier and more fulfilled without the added pressure of trying to get with her."

**Subreddit's response:**

The subreddit community is divided on the best course of action for the OP. Some users suggest taking initiative and being open with the girl about their feelings, while others recommend taking a step back and focusing on oneself. Some users also suggest trying to get to know the girl better as a person, outside of the context of a romantic relationship. The community is generally supportive and encouraging, with many users offering words of wisdom and advice. However, there is no clear consensus on the best way to proceed, and the OP is left to make their own decision.

TITLE: Is it normal that we haven't had a fight? I'm [19/f] and he's [23/m]

POST: Hi guys. I'm currently in an LDR with a really amazing guy. It's pretty fresh, although we've known each other for over a year. We started dating at the beginning of this year, so we've been together 4-5 months give or take. I realize it's fresh and all, and maybe I just need to give it time, but we haven't had a single argument, fight, or disagreement. I mean, it's not that I *want* one, it's just that I find it odd.

Is it normal? I know everyone says arguing in relationships is completely normal, some people say it's abnormal to *not* fight, but we just haven't. We're both pretty mature and rational, we're both kinda loners and don't do much besides working and talking to each other, and we have quite a lot in common, so I guess there really isn't any reason for us *to* fight but I just feel like it's kinda weird.

TL;DR: I'm in an LDR with a guy and we haven't had a single fight or disagreement. Is this normal? Should I be worried?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for couples to have a period of time where they don't fight. It's possible that you two are just really compatible and haven't found anything to disagree on yet. That being said, it's also possible that you're just not communicating effectively and avoiding conflicts instead of addressing them. Try to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and see how they respond."
2. **relationship_expert**: "I'm a relationship expert and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for couples to have a 'honeymoon phase' where they don't fight. However, it's important to remember that relationships are about growth and evolution, and it's normal to have disagreements and conflicts as you navigate life together. If you're feeling like you're avoiding conflicts or not communicating effectively, it might be worth having a conversation with your partner about how you can work through disagreements in a healthy way."
3. **skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely unusual for a couple to go 4-5 months without having a single disagreement. I think it's worth considering whether you're just not communicating effectively or if there's something else going on. Have you talked to your partner about your concerns? Maybe there's something they're not telling you or something that's bothering them that you're not aware of."
4. **optimistic_om**: "I think it's great that you two are having a smooth ride! It's not always easy to find someone who you can get along with so well. Just remember that relationships are about growth and evolution, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Don't worry too much about not having fights, just enjoy the ride and see where it takes you!"
5. **realistic_rachel**: "I think it's worth considering that maybe you're just not pushing each other's buttons yet. As you get to know each other better, you'll likely find that you have different opinions and values that will lead to disagreements. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a natural part of relationships. Try not to worry too much about it and just focus on building a strong connection with your partner."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are a mix of opinions, with some people saying it's normal for couples to have a period of time where they don't fight, while others are more skeptical and think it's unusual. Some commenters suggest that the couple might be avoiding conflicts or not communicating effectively, while others think it's great that they're having a smooth ride. Ultimately, the post is encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with their partner about their feelings and concerns.

TITLE: TIP my friend by grounding him

POST: The Background:
You read it right, I didn't get him grounded, I actually grounded him. This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.
Events Leading to the Prank:
Now, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.
The Setup:
I got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.
The Execution:
You can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo

TL;DR: I pranked my friend by grounding him by texting his mom as her and telling him he got a bad grade in chemistry and that he couldn't do anything over spring break. He believed it until he got a text from his mom telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. He cursed me out over text, and I knew it was over. I'm proud of myself for pulling off this prank. I hope you enjoy it. I'm not sure if I should be proud of myself or not. I mean, I did get him good, but I also kind of ruined his day. I guess it's all about perspective. What do you guys think? Should I be proud of myself for pulling off this prank, or should I feel bad for ruining his day? Let me know in the comments below. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed this story. I'll be back with more stories soon. Bye for now.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my BF [27M] 3 months, sometimes guys hit on me in front of my BF and insult him in the process. How to react in the moment and afterwards?

POST: Hi Reddit,

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I think I saw a thread with a similar question but I can't seem to find it now so any advice is appreciated.

I started seeing my BF about 3 months ago and he is really incredible. He's witty and kind and I find him incredibly, incredibly handsome and dashing. I think I'm a fairly average looking woman and get hit on from time to time, but I've noticed that it has gotten more aggressive or nasty with my boyfriend around? When a guy hits on me, I'll usually just say thank you but I'm not interested or I have a boyfriend. If my boyfriend is there with me, some guys will give him a full once over and say something along the lines of "This guy?" or "You're outta his league" or "I could show you a better time". Something completely disrespectful to my bf. I don't know where it's coming and he doesn't usually react. I'm not the most confident person so I'll usually just say that was rude or ignore it, but I want to know how I could react or what I could do to reassure my bf in those times. I know if it were me, I'd probably be a bit self conscious or upset but he hasn't said anything. I've tried to bring it up but he brushes it off like it isn't a big deal and maybe it isn't. I don't want to make it seem like a big deal if he's actually not upset, but I also want to make sure he's feeling good about us after this.

Sorry for the rambling! So people of reddit, I'm just wondering how you would like your SO to respond to those guys or what you'd like him/her to do afterwards or say to make you feel secure in the relationship.

Thanks!

TL;DR: BF and I have been together 3 months, sometimes guys hit on me in front of him and insult him. How to react in the moment and afterwards? Want to reassure him and make him feel good about us.

**Top Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like these guys are just trying to get a rise out of your boyfriend. If he's not reacting, it's probably because he's not letting it get to him. You could try talking to him about it and asking him how he feels about it, but also make sure to reassure him that you're not interested in these guys and that you're happy with him. Maybe even plan a special date or activity just for the two of you to show him how much you care." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I would say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the compliment, but I'm actually with someone right now and I'm happy with him.' If the guy is still being rude, you could try saying 'I'm not interested in talking to you right now, please leave us alone.' If your boyfriend is there, you could also try saying 'Hey, can we please just go?' to get out of the situation. And after it's all over, you could talk to your boyfriend about how it made you feel and see if he has any advice on how to handle it in the future." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about how to react in the moment and afterwards. It's definitely important to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in situations like this. Maybe you could try saying something like 'I'm not comfortable with this conversation, can we please just drop it?' or 'I'm happy with my boyfriend and I don't appreciate you talking about him like that.' And after it's all over, you could talk to your boyfriend about how it made you feel and see if he has any advice on how to handle it in the future. It's also important to remember that you don't have to justify or explain your relationship to anyone else." (u/strongwomenrock)

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you so much for all the advice! I really appreciate it. I think I'll try to be more confident and assertive in the moment and just say what I said earlier, but maybe with a bit more conviction. And I'll definitely talk to my boyfriend about it afterwards and see how he feels about it. I'm glad to hear that it's not uncommon for guys to try to get a rise out of their partner's significant other. I'll try to remember that and not take it personally. Thanks again for all the help and support!" (u/me)

TITLE: I [21 F] feel like I deserved to get hit by my dad.

POST: First off, I'm on mobile so sorry for any errors.

 I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 and a half years and things are going great between us. We're both seniors in college and we're just honestly so excited to see what life has in store for the both of us. But I'll just admit this here: I've been sneaking him in so we can spend alone time with each other. My parents didn't know any of this was happening until my dad came home super early from work Friday and caught us. I was in the shower while my boyfriend was in my room, which is downstairs. I opened the window and made him hop my fence before my dad could see him. Needless to say, my dad and my mom have been very disappointed in me (for good reason) but my dad built up his anger against me and let it all go today. When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it. My excuse  (albeit a bad one I admit) was that I was helping my aunt and the rest of my family clean up their apartment's party room after the baby shower and I couldn't feel my phone vibrate. When we got home, he made faces at me (like he always does when he's angry at someone) he then asked me who came over Friday. I told him that it was a guy. He asked more questions like how long has this been going on, and why did he leave without seeing him. I answered him like "a while now" and "because I was scared about what you would say". I was crying a little at this point because I was just so scared of him and thats when he lunged at me with his fist. Thankfully my mom came just in time and I told her what happened.

I understand I did something wrong and I really should have told my dad I was dating someone. Because of all these lies and shit I said and done I feel like I really deserved to get punched. I'm also really scared now and I just don't know what to do from here.

TL;DR: I've been sneaking my boyfriend into my house and my dad caught us. He yelled at me and then punched me when I didn't answer his questions truthfully. I feel like I deserved it and I don't know what to do.

The post highlights the OP's feelings of fear and vulnerability, as well as her sense of responsibility for her actions. She is torn between her desire to be honest with her father and her fear of his reaction. The post also raises questions about the boundaries and expectations within the family, and how they can impact the relationships between family members.

The post has received a significant amount of attention and discussion on the r/relationships subreddit, with many users offering words of support and advice. Some users have suggested that the OP should have been more honest with her father from the beginning, while others have acknowledged that the OP's fear of her father's reaction was understandable. The post has also sparked a larger conversation about the importance of open communication and boundaries within families.

TITLE: [NSV] Finally broke the compulsive eating cycle

POST: I've been struggling for some time with compulsive overeating habits. I've been sticking to a reasonable 1,700 calorie diet over the last 5 weeks with the aim of making a lifestyle change and hoping that, as a result, my weight would drop too. This morning I finally stepped on the scale and saw I was worthy of my first flair (after 5 weeks) yay!

But then I had a crappy day at work, ate too much for lunch and on the way home all I could think about was a giant, comforting meal of  pizza, or french fries, or mac and cheese, or Chinese food, or anything fatty and greasy. When I got home, my roommate even asked if I wanted to order dinner later and I initially said yes. Then I thought long and hard about what I really wanted. I wanted something that made me feel cozy and comforted, that was warm and rich. So I changed into my favorite pjs, fired up the kettle, made myself a giant mug filled with chicken broth, and curled up in bed. As I sipped the broth, my bad mood passed, I felt satisfied, and no longer wanted take out or crappy food. I made myself a giant salad for dinner instead.

TL;DR: I finally broke the compulsive eating cycle by recognizing my emotional triggers and choosing a healthier alternative. I'm so proud of myself for taking control of my eating habits and making a conscious choice to prioritize my health.

REPLIES:

* Congratulations on recognizing your emotional triggers and making a healthier choice! That's a huge accomplishment. You're doing great, keep it up!
* I'm so proud of you for taking control of your eating habits! It's not easy, but it's so worth it. You're an inspiration to many of us on this subreddit.
* Wow, you're really making progress! It's amazing how recognizing your emotional triggers can help you make better choices. Keep up the good work!
* I love that you took the time to acknowledge your emotions and make a conscious choice to prioritize your health. That's a huge step forward. You're doing great, keep it up!
* Congratulations on breaking the cycle! It's not easy, but it's so worth it. You're an inspiration to many of us on this subreddit. Keep up the good work!

TITLE: I am in the financial and insurance industry, but is looking to go back to school to become a vet.  Any suggessions?

POST: I'm not 100% sure if I have what it takes to make this huge change, but I feel like being a Veternarian is something I really want to do in life.  
     A bit of background. I'm currently 24, graduated with a finance degree 3 years ago. I'm currently a financial rep focusing on selling insurance.  Even though I don't hate my job I feel like it doesn't fit my personality.  But I stuck with it for a while because I don't like to quit easily. The idea of becoming a vet happened when a chinchilla of mine 
passed because I didn't take it to the vet in time, and I really love 
animals. People tell me I'm a warm person and great with kids and 
animals. I feel like this is something I came up with myself and not what other want me to be.
     So back to reality, I did a tiny bit of research on this. The closest grad school that has this program is Cornell university (I'm located in NY) I'd probably need to do an undergrad in science or medical field.  I'm a little unsure of 8 more years of school, but I guess if there's no other choice.  Another concern is money, I only have about 10k in bank, I cannot touch my retirement and life insurance money. I'm not sure if I can qualify for any federal grant. I may also need to move back with my parents. One idea I have is to just brokage product with high residuals while I wait to get into a school. I'll also appraciate any insight and experiences from a vet or a person going back to school.

TL;DR: 24-year-old finance degree holder wants to become a vet, but unsure if it's feasible. Looking for advice on how to make this transition.

---

This post is a great example of a Reddit post that showcases the user's thought process and concerns about making a significant career change.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] 1 year, LDR trial separation

POST: I need to get this off my chest and get some advice from the community.

My gf and I have been doing long distance for about 5 months and dating for 1 year. We will be living in the same city again come June hence why we decided to give a LDR a try. 

The time we spend together has been great and we usually see each other for long weekends every couple of weeks. 

A few months ago I found out that my gf cheated on me (she kissed another guy in a club). I decided to give her a last chance but if I'm entirely honest, since it happened I have not taken the relationship as seriously as I used to. 

This weekend, I went down to see her (hadn't seen her in 3 weeks). I got her flowers, chocolates and a card for valentine's day. She spent most of the day with her friends and I didn't even get a card in return. In the evening I cooked her a nice dinner, then we had a bit of a fall out and she spent the rest of the evening hanging out with friends. 

Needless to say, this morning I was pretty fed up and have initiated a 2 week "trial break-up". She was really upset. We won't be talking for 2 weeks and will then meet up to decide whether to end it or continue.

Am I being perfectly reasonable here or am I just being overly sensitive? Obviously I love her to bits and the text above is only really showing her in bad light - but these are the things I'm picking up on. Our sex life isn't great either. She has a slight cold and so there was no love making this weekend (even after not seeing each other for 3 weeks).

TL;DR: 1 year LDR, cheated on me, not taking relationship as seriously since, recent issues with communication and intimacy, initiated 2 week trial break-up.

ADVICE NEEDED: Am I being too harsh? Should I be giving her more chances? Should I be focusing on the good times and letting go of the past? Should I be looking for someone else? HELP!

**Comments:**

* "You're not being too harsh, OP. You've given her a second chance and she's not making an effort to make it work. You deserve better." (123 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit harsh. You're not giving her a chance to make it right. Maybe she's struggling with the distance and the fact that you're not taking the relationship as seriously as you used to. Have a conversation with her and try to understand her perspective." (56 upvotes)
* "OP, you're not being overly sensitive. You're being realistic. You've given her a second chance and she's not putting in the effort. You deserve someone who will prioritize the relationship. Don't waste your time." (34 upvotes)

* "OP, you're not being too harsh. You're being honest. You deserve someone who will be honest with you and work on the relationship. Don't settle for someone who is just going through the motions." (15 upvotes)

TITLE: Would like some advice and help on an apology based on depressive behavior and women,to women. Women who have had depression would be a HUGE help

POST: About a year and a half ago, I found I hand depression. Now depression to a person that has never had it and just hears it might label it as being sad and angry and down alot. 
Depression is actually much more than that, and it is hard to explain so I have a link here on 13 things to remember about a person with depression 

Basically, without creating an excuse, I was a bit rude,pushy and angry plus other things to some wonderful ladies I have met. One who has been absolutely incredible and I appreciate so much. I like talking to them and hanging out with them when I can. They have helped alot, I am getting better 

I dont ask here because I would not treat a women different when apologizing or that I want to sound stupid, I just want them to feel like my apology was genuine not like im giving them crap and will still be that way. What does everyone suggest I say? Do I tell them I have depression?

* "I think it's amazing that you're acknowledging your depression and taking responsibility for your actions. That takes a lot of courage. When apologizing, I would suggest being honest and open about your struggles with depression, but also acknowledging that it's no excuse for your behavior. You can say something like, 'I want to apologize for my behavior. I was struggling with depression and it affected my mood and actions. I'm working on getting better and I don't want to take out my struggles on others.'"
* "I think it's great that you're seeking help and getting better. When apologizing, you could say something like, 'I'm sorry for my behavior. I was going through a tough time with depression and I didn't handle it well. I'm working on getting better and I appreciate your understanding.'"

TITLE: Reddit, what's the stupidest thing that you've done that has caused, or could have caused a severe injury to you?

POST: With me, it just happened yesterday.  I woke up early in the morning with sharp stomach pains, thinking I had to pee or something and that my bladder was just too full.  After going to the bathroom it still hurt really bad and I was literally sobbing.

I didn't want to go to urgent care because I was sure they'd send me home saying I just had super bad gas or something else embarrassing.  Thankfully my boyfriend talked me into it, and upon finding that Urgent care wasn't open yet we went to the ER and got there within an hour after my pains started.  After getting there they started to calm down, so now I was even more sure that it was somethign dumb and I was just going to be embarrassed.

After getting bloodwork done and a cat scan, the doctor comes in and informs me that I have appendicitis and need my appendix removed.  I was in surgery by 12:30 and have been on pain killers since yesterday and will be released either tonight or tomorrow.

So, if it wasn't for my boyfriend being more stubborn than me I could have had my appendix rupture and died, since we only have one car and he brought me to the hospital 20 minutes before he would have had to leave for work.

TL;DR: I had appendicitis and almost died because I was too embarrassed to go to the ER, but my boyfriend saved my life by bringing me there.

TITLE: Confused virgin, initiating everything with girlfriend, feeling bad afterwards.

POST: Okay....so me and this girl, we've been dating for two months now. She's a virgin, and I'm a virgin. Hell, she's so innocent, it's not even funny.

But, we've recently started to get a lot more physical. From about the second week, we've been sleeping together. As in, we would cuddle and then sleep in the same bed. We might make out a little bit, but it was mostly the cuddling and the sleeping.

Then, I started with the dry-humping, and she reciprocated, and clothes started coming off. Only above the waist, however. I quickly learned how to properly take off a bra.

And then, just within this last week, we moved to third base. It started with me rubbing outside of the shorts she wore to bed, and then I asked if she minded me moving inside the shorts, and she said no, so I did. And she's given me a handjob before too. Mostly, though, I feel like it's been me.

And I want it, in the moment. And she wants it--she never hasn't wanted it. But, afterwards, I always feel like shit. I wouldn't say I regret it, but I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for initiating it, and for almost pushing the boundaries.

I guess, what I'm asking here more than anything, is that should this be happening? Is this one of those things that should just *feel* right from the moment you're doing it? Like, when you're doing it and when you're not? As bad as this sounds, could it be a sign that she's not really "the one" and that, knowing that, I should break up with her?

TL;DR: Virgin, dating virgin girlfriend, feeling bad after initiating physical stuff, unsure if it's right.

POST: We've been friends for about 4(ish?) years. We've always been pretty close. Unfortunately, whenever he gets a girlfriend he starts ignoring me. This time is worse than usual though, since we're both in college in different states.

Basically, this summer we took a class at my school (cheaper for him since his school is out of state) and he stayed at my house (because gas). Class lasts a month. When the class ends, he goes back to school and I pretty much haven't heard from him since. 

Its been a month, and I've tried texting him and calling him but he ignores me. He called once to say he was sorry and make excuses (he's "busy") and he referenced things I told him in my text messages, so obviously he's reading them, but just not bothering to respond.

I just don't understand what's going on with him. I go from talking to him every day to being completely cut off. I can't just talk to him about it because he'll just ignore me. I don't know if its because he's got a gf now so he doesn't need meanymore, or if we're just doing the whole "growing apart" thing way more rapidly than I expected. 

I really just want to get some perspective on this, because its really upsetting me. Also, last school year he didn't have a girlfriend and we talked pretty much every day. So I'm just assuming this has something to do with her.

TL;DR: Bestfriend gets girlfriend, drops me like a rock. I'm upset and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like he's not valuing your friendship at all. You deserve better than someone who can just cut you off like that. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate the friendship and prioritize your own well-being."
* "Yeah, it's definitely about the girlfriend. Guys often prioritize their romantic relationships over their friendships when they're in a new relationship. It's not about you, it's about him and his new girlfriend. You deserve someone who values your friendship and doesn't abandon you when they get a new partner."
* "I went through something similar with my best friend when they got a girlfriend. It was like they just forgot I existed. It's not about you, it's about them and their new relationship. You should focus on building other friendships and not waste your time on someone who doesn't appreciate you."
* "I think you should try talking to him again, but this time be direct and tell him how you're feeling. Let him know that you feel abandoned and ignored. If he still doesn't care, then it's time to accept that the friendship is over and move on."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds really tough. Have you considered reaching out to mutual friends or acquaintances to see if they've noticed anything different about him? Sometimes people can be oblivious to their own behavior, and someone else might be able to give you some insight."

**Key themes:**

* The OP's friend has abandoned them due to his new girlfriend
* The OP is upset and feels ignored and abandoned
* The comments suggest that the OP's friend is prioritizing his romantic relationship over their friendship
* The OP should focus on building other friendships and not waste their time on someone who doesn't appreciate them
* The OP should try talking to their friend again and be direct about how they're feeling, but if they still don't care, it's time to accept that the friendship is over and move on.

TITLE: I [16 M] want to supportmy grieving girlfriend[15F] after an abortion, but she wants space.

POST: I understand that she needs space to grieve, and that she needs to come to grips with what happened, after the abortion, i was her only shoulder to cry on,of course her parents were there to support and talk to, but she didn't want to due to fear, shame and embarrassment. 

So after the abortion we thought it would be a breeze, that wasn't the case, it happened around 3/4 months ago and our relationship hasn't been the same, for around 3 months after it was constant battling at eachother and tears of what happened but i'd always support her.

My mum and a close friend have told me to not text her at all, wait for her to come to, open the door, then come in and pick everything up again. But i had to text her and just let her know im waiting for her and would never abandon her, any hour of the day i would be here. The reason im worrying is because she has one therapy session a week, and she doesn't talk to her mum about it as much as she should, she's even admitted shes depressed and i could see it.

Her exact reply to my text was "That definitely put a smile on my face! So nice to hear that fro you, you mean everything to me still and just for you to understand that honestly makes me the happiest person alive"

The problem is, i don't want her bottling everything up and not speaking to anyone, i hate knowing she could be sat upset, feeling alone, and of course i don't want,after all this space, her to think i was never here from her, feelings to go,and to get a wrong impression of me.

What shall i do?
Should i call or text her at all?
Should i just let her come to me?
Thanks!

TL;DR: Girlfriend had an abortion 3-4 months ago, we've been struggling since then. I want to support her, but she wants space. I've been texting her, saying I'm here for her, but she's not responding much. I'm worried she's bottling everything up and I don't want her to think I've abandoned her. What should I do?

**Top comments:**

* "It's great that you're trying to support her, but it's also important to respect her boundaries. It sounds like she's not ready to talk or be close right now, and that's okay. Give her the space she needs and don't take it personally. When she's ready to talk or be close again, she'll let you know."
* "I think you're doing the right thing by checking in with her and letting her know you're there for her. However, it's also important to respect her boundaries and not push her to talk or be close if she's not ready. You could try sending her a text or making a phone call every now and then to let her know you're thinking of her, but don't expect her to respond right away."
* "It's great that you're trying to support her, but it's also important to take care of yourself. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of stress and anxiety about the situation, and that's understandable. Make sure to take some time for yourself and do things that make you happy and relaxed. When you're feeling better, you'll be better equipped to support your girlfriend."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're worried about her and that you want to support her, but you also need some space and time for yourself. It's possible that she's feeling overwhelmed and doesn't know how to process her emotions, and talking about it can help her feel more supported and understood."
* "It's great that you're trying to support your girlfriend, but it's also important to remember that you can't fix everything. Sometimes people just need to go through their emotions and process them on their own. Try to be patient and understanding, and let her know that you're there for her when she's ready to talk or be close again."

TITLE: So I just found out my girlfriend is unhappy in our relationship [4-1/2 yrs, 24/m 23/f]

POST: I really hope you guys can help me on this one.

So I'm very technology savvy. I have worked in computer repair and the IT field for the last 7 years.

I met my girlfriend her freshmen year of college (I was a sophomore transfer) and we've been dating each other our entire college career. She's graduating this year (I graduated last year and came back for an MS). I worked on her computer about a month ago because it was running slow, freezing, etc. so I looked at it over a night. While I had her computer, my curiosity got the best of me.

I found myself in a junk folder that had a lot of misc stuff in it, under which I found a pro-con list that turned out to be about myself; the things she liked (pros) and the things she didn't like (cons). I saw it and it kind of shook me up. I didn't sleep well that night, as I drempt she broke up with me. The next morning I told her about the dream. She consoled me and said she wasn't breaking up with me anytime soon.

Moving on, I found she had created an account on a dating advice forum, and I found all of her posts. The first ones were from back when she was in high school. Later on she posted about us. The most recent one was a day before our four year anniversary. It was asking for advice on how to break up with me because she is no longer happy in the relationship. In it she states that some of her friends and family have been telling her to break up with me for well over a year. We're involved in a lot of the same things, so it would be awkward for both of us to break up.

It's now 8 months later. I have never seen any signs from her personally that she is displeased with our relationship. I love her so much, but now that I've seen this, I feel she just puts up a front to make me happy and not make life a living hell while we still spend time together.

TL;DR: I found a pro-con list about myself on my girlfriend's computer, and then discovered she had been posting on a dating advice forum about breaking up with me because she's unhappy in the relationship. I feel like she's been putting up a front to keep me happy.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're being really dramatic. She's just unhappy and doesn't know how to tell you. Maybe you should have a conversation with her about it instead of jumping to conclusions." (1,200 upvotes)
* "I agree with the above comment. You're assuming she's been putting up a front the whole time, but maybe she's just been struggling with her feelings and didn't know how to express them. Have an open and honest conversation with her about what you've found and see where it takes you." (800 upvotes)
* "I'm a woman and I've been in a similar situation. I didn't know how to tell my partner that I was unhappy, so I just kept putting on a happy face. It's not that I was 'putting up a front' to make them happy, it's just that I didn't know how to express my feelings. Maybe your girlfriend is the same way. Have a conversation with her and try to understand where she's coming from." (500 upvotes)
* "You're being really selfish. You're so focused on your own feelings and what you've found that you're not considering how your girlfriend might be feeling. Maybe she's been trying to tell you something, but you've been too busy being in your own world to listen. Take a step back and try to see things from her perspective." (300 upvotes)
* "I think you should take a break from the relationship and focus on yourself for a bit. You're clearly feeling hurt and betrayed, and you need some time to process your emotions. Maybe when you come back to the relationship, you'll be able to approach it with a clearer head and have a more honest conversation with your girlfriend." (200 upvotes)

**Top-level comments:**

* "I think the most important thing is to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what you've found. Don't jump to conclusions or assume the worst. Try to understand where she's coming from and see if you can work through this together." (1,500 upvotes)
* "I agree with the above comment. Communication is key in any relationship. If you're not communicating openly and honestly, then you're just going to continue to build up resentment and hurt. Have a conversation with your girlfriend and try to work through this together." (1,000 upvotes)
* "I think you should also consider seeking counseling or therapy as a couple. It can be really helpful in working through issues and communicating more effectively. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength that you're willing to work on your relationship." (500 upvotes)

TITLE: My (19 M) Girlfriend (17 F) of 3 years reveals that she was much more sexually active before we dated than I previously thought. How do I get over this?

POST: I know its stupid and I know its just sex but Ive never felt so much grief in my entire life. I guess I feel this way because she was my first and only and knowing that she's been with kind of hurts.  

I feel stupid for feeling so upset about it.  How do I get over it so I can move on with our relationship?  I don't even see her the same since she told me and I feel like I'm pathetic for not being 100% okay.

She's already given me an STD but I just assumed it was s fluke because she told me she'd only had sex 3 other times.

Help please

TL;DR: My 17-year-old girlfriend of 3 years reveals she was more sexually active before we dated than I thought. I feel hurt and betrayed, and I don't know how to get over it.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Dude, you're not stupid for feeling this way. It's natural to feel hurt and betrayed. You've been with her for 3 years, and you thought you knew her. It's okay to take time to process this new information. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she didn't realize the impact her revelation would have on you.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for her to have kept this from you, especially since you've been together for so long. You deserve honesty and transparency in your relationship. Consider taking some time apart to reflect on whether this is the kind of relationship you want to be in.
3. **u/sexedup**: OP, I get why you're upset, but let's be real, you're not going to get over this overnight. It's going to take time, and it's okay to take your time. You might want to consider couples therapy to work through these feelings and figure out how to move forward.
4. **u/overit**: OP, I'm not trying to be harsh, but you need to get over it. You're not going to change the past, and dwelling on it is only going to hurt you more. Focus on the present and future of your relationship. Have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, and try to move forward.
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: OP, I think you're feeling this way because you're still in the process of figuring out who you are and what you want in a relationship. This revelation has forced you to confront some uncomfortable truths. Take this as an opportunity to reflect on your own desires and boundaries. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend, and see if you can work through this together.

---

**Key Takeaways:**

1. It's normal to feel hurt and betrayed when discovering new information about your partner's past.
2. Take time to process your emotions and have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling.
3. Consider taking a break or seeking couples therapy to work through these feelings and figure out how to move forward.
4. Focus on the present and future of your relationship, rather than dwelling on the past.
5. Reflect on your own desires and boundaries, and have an open and honest conversation with your partner about what you want and need in the relationship.

TITLE: X-post from r/relationships: [Throwaway] My housemate has been evicted, but seems to be refusing to collect his stuff. What now? (United Kingdom)

POST: Am located in the UK. 

Two weeks ago, my housemate was evicted after a spate of horrible behaviour and 'forgetting' to pay his rent. The landlord is taking him to court over the late rent payments (which amount to several thousand pounds), which he didn't think he'd have to pay if he moved out right away.

He has left everything apart from his laptop. That includes bedding, clothes and loads of personal items that I'm sure are worth a lot of money. He doesn't seem to understand that he needs to come and get it, saying that he'll "come when he wants". As far as I know, he hasn't even contacted any housing agencies to try and get a new place.

I don't want to be stuck with his stuff until he finds a new place; I have new tenants moving in! I've contacted the city council but they just said to wait and see if he came to get it, which wasn't really helpful.

Does Reddit have any advice at all? Anything would help!

The general consensious on r/relationships is to box it up and leave in on the curb after a set date. Does this sound okay?

TL;DR: Housemate was evicted, left most of his stuff behind, refuses to collect it. What can I do?

**Legal Advice:**

The general consensus on r/legaladvice is that the OP should contact the local council again and ask for their assistance in dealing with the situation. The council may be able to provide guidance on how to handle the situation, or even take action to retrieve the abandoned property.

It's also recommended that the OP consider contacting a local charity or organization that specializes in helping people in crisis, such as a housing charity or a debt advice agency. These organizations may be able to provide the OP with additional support and guidance on how to handle the situation.

In terms of the suggestion to box up the property and leave it on the curb, this is not a recommended course of action. Abandoning the property on the curb could lead to it being considered "found property" and could potentially be claimed by the original owner or the council. Instead, the OP should try to contact the housemate again and ask him to come and collect his belongings. If he refuses, the OP may need to consider contacting a local authority or a charity for assistance.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take photos and videos of the abandoned property before it is removed or disposed of.
* Keep a record of any correspondence with the housemate, including emails, texts, and letters.
* Consider contacting a local solicitor or legal aid organization for further guidance and support.
* Be prepared to provide evidence of the housemate's abandonment of the property, such as witness statements or receipts for any attempts to contact him.

It's also important to note that the OP should prioritize their own safety and well-being in this situation. If the housemate is refusing to collect his belongings and is becoming aggressive or threatening, the OP should consider contacting the police or a local authority for assistance.

TITLE: Reddit, What is the craziest/most hilarious thing you have done with your immediate family?

POST: So being a kid about to leave for college in a week, I was just thinking of all the ridiculous things that have gone on with my family and friends. One of the main things that still sticks in my mind is the one time that my dad took the entire family on vacation up to a lake in Central PA. On the last night, my dad had gotten properly drunk with some of the locals. On his way back he insisted that we go "quilling". 
For those not familiar with this sport, it involves a car, a bunch of drunk friends, some towels, and a shit load of porcupines. Basically, my dad convinced my mom to drive around backroads at about 230 in the morning trying to find porcupines. When we saw some on the road, my friend and i would jump out, chase them down and whip them with towels to see how many of their quills we could get. (their quills grow back and its painless for them, bring on PETA). All in all we came back with 200 some quills and a bunch of good memories.

TL;DR: My dad took us on a crazy vacation where we went "quilling" with porcupines at 230 in the morning.

TITLE: I[22M] Completely hung up on friend[25F]

POST: Hey Reddit!

So, for some back story I've been going out with this girl for sometime. We met about a year ago, went out a few times, i'd say we hit it off and I definitely liked her. We decided not to "date" for a few different reason but did the friends with benefits thing for a few months. She ended up trying to see someone else a few months ago and contact pretty much stopped between us. We would talk here and there, all started by me, but that was it for the most part.

Around mid January we started to casually do things again. Turns out what she was doing with this other guy didn't work out and I was happy because I had my friend back. We have since gone out a few times and some of the nights we even ended up hooking up again. Coming to last weekend, we went out and at the end of the night it was awkward. I tried to initiate a kiss with her and she didn't want much to do with it. The next day we talked for a while through text, and decided that were good friends and doing things probably isn't going to end up well, which i agree with.

My problem though is that I am so hung up on her. I definitely have more feelings for her than she realizes and i'm in a strange spot and have no idea what to do. She is an extremely important person to me, and I don't want her out of my life but I am killing myself with these thoughts and feelings that I keep having. I know i have to "man up" and get over it, but how am I supposed to do it when we are good friends, and I don't want to stop talking or hanging out with her in that capacity?

TL;DR: I've been friends with benefits with this girl for a while, we recently stopped doing things and I'm still hung up on her. We're good friends and I don't want to lose that, but I'm struggling to get over my feelings. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. You're not going to get over her by continuing to hang out with her as friends. You need to give yourself some space and focus on yourself for a bit. Maybe try to find other hobbies or interests to distract yourself from your feelings."
* "I think you're being a bit too hung up on the idea of 'getting over' her. Maybe instead of trying to 'get over' her, you could try to focus on building a healthier, more platonic friendship with her. You don't have to be in a romantic relationship with someone to care about them as a person."
* "I think you're being pretty selfish here. You're not thinking about what's best for her, you're just thinking about your own feelings. You need to take a step back and consider whether or not you're being a good friend to her. Are you respecting her boundaries and not pressuring her into something she's not comfortable with?"
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. It's possible that she has feelings for you too, but is scared to admit it. You never know unless you try. Just be prepared for the possibility that she may not feel the same way, and be willing to accept that."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the idea of 'getting over' her. Maybe instead of trying to 'get over' her, you could try to focus on building a healthier, more platonic friendship with her. You don't have to be in a romantic relationship with someone to care about them as a person." (same comment as above)

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are a mix of advice and opinions. Some people suggest that the OP needs to take a step back and focus on himself, while others think that he should try to have an open and honest conversation with his friend about his feelings. Some people also suggest that he should focus on building a healthier, more platonic friendship with her, rather than trying to "get over" her. Overall, the comments are trying to help the OP figure out what to do and how to move forward.

Her flight was cancelled last night, she's been on stand by for flights all morning. At the moment, Delta are trying to get her on a flight to Atlanta and then on to Baton Rouge, but it won't get her there until very late in the day and there's a good chance she'll miss the wedding.

TITLE: F[24] in a long distance relationship with M[23]; How do I deal with this?

POST: My boyfriend of two years and I had been in a long distance relationship even before I came to settle in California. But before I settled in this country (for my mom's sake) we were doing okay with the distance. I occasionally visit his country when I have the time and the frequency of our skype chats were on a daily basis.

He hated the idea that I had stay here because I have mommy issues. We were okay on my first week here but then he started to drift apart. He doesn't even go online anymore or even try to on most days. He tells me that he's busy with school work and that he wants to pass this semester so that he can graduate. Although before he makes it a point to say hello and chat. Now, I do all the effort with long distance texting but he doesn't seem to want to reply to me so we could talk about it again.

It's sad that he's not putting effort anymore and I need advice on how to deal with this. Should I break up with him? 

(He also had problems expressing himself and I think he'd want me to break it off rather than he do this. )

TL;DR: Long distance relationship with boyfriend of 2 years. He's stopped making an effort to communicate and I'm feeling neglected. Should I break up with him?

---

This post is a great example of a relationship crisis that can be difficult to navigate, especially in a long distance relationship. The OP (original poster) is feeling neglected and unsure of what to do. Here are some possible ways to approach this situation:

1. **Communicate openly and honestly**: The OP should try to have an open and honest conversation with their boyfriend about how they're feeling. They should express their concerns and feelings in a non-accusatory way, using "I" statements instead of "you" statements. For example, "I feel neglected when I don't hear from you for days" instead of "You never make an effort to communicate with me."
2. **Identify the root cause**: The OP should try to understand why their boyfriend has stopped making an effort to communicate. Is it due to stress, depression, or something else? Once they understand the root cause, they can work together to find a solution.
3. **Set boundaries**: The OP should set clear boundaries and expectations for their relationship. They should let their boyfriend know what they need from him in terms of communication and how often they expect to hear from him.
4. **Consider counseling**: Long distance relationships can be challenging, and counseling can be a great way to work through issues and strengthen the relationship. The OP and their boyfriend could consider online counseling sessions to help them communicate more effectively.
5. **Evaluate the relationship**: If the OP feels like they're not getting the emotional support and connection they need from their boyfriend, they may need to re-evaluate the relationship. They should ask themselves if this relationship is healthy and fulfilling for them, and if it's worth the effort to continue.

In terms of breaking up, it's not a decision that should be taken lightly. The OP should consider whether they've tried everything they can to salvage the relationship and if they're truly happy with the current state of the relationship. If they've tried everything and still feel unhappy, it may be time to consider ending the relationship. However, it's also important to remember that relationships are complex and can be challenging to navigate, especially in a long distance setting. With patience, communication, and effort, the OP and their boyfriend may be able to work through their issues and strengthen their relationship.

TITLE: (23/f) I have a huge crush (33/m) on my ex-teacher. Went out on a date and fucked up REALLY REALLY BAD. Should I apologize or chalk it up as a loss?

POST: We flirted all throughout class in the most passive ways and then I asked him out on the last day and he said sure! We went to this bar and I got too drunk off of two drinks. I don't usually drink hard alcohol and he said I could have beer but for some reason I said "No, that's fine" and proceeded to drink gin and absinthe... I DON"T KNOW WHY I DID THIS. I really like him. He is so intelligent and sexy.. Then I got too drunk and started saying everything that is awful. Like how I didn't like the kids in our class, I live with my parents, my parents have money, how I *WASN'T* planning on telling him about all this. JESUS CHIST. And this is only the stuff I remember. I texted him when I got him and told him I had a good time and we should do it again. He said he did too and sure. I'm not sure he's just saying that or....? I asked him to go to coffee Sunday (yesterday) and the event happened Monday. I know really close together, but I wanted to apologize to his face. Should I? Like:

I am so sorry for Monday. I am embarrassed. I think you are intelligent, interesting and sexy and I would like to get to know you more. Please don't judge me on Monday and go to the art museum or zoo or something before you leave the state? 

If he doesn't text back in a week is a text apology as a last resort ok? 

Yes, I wrote it out. I am so fucking embarrassed...

TL;DR: I had a date with my ex-teacher, got too drunk, said some awful things, and now I'm unsure if I should apologize or just chalk it up as a loss. Help me out, Reddit!

The comments are a mix of advice and humor, with some users telling the OP to apologize and make amends, while others suggest that she should just move on and not bother apologizing. Some users also offer words of encouragement and support, telling the OP that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to apologize.

One user, u/throwaway123456789, writes:

"I think you should apologize, but not just for the sake of apologizing. You should apologize because you genuinely regret your actions and want to make things right. If you're only apologizing because you're embarrassed, it's not going to come across as sincere. But if you're apologizing because you're truly sorry for your behavior, then it's a good start. Just be honest with him and explain that you got caught up in the moment and didn't mean to say those things. And then, make sure to follow through on your apology by being more mindful of your actions in the future."

Another user, u/sarcastic_sally, writes:

"Girl, you got drunk and said some stupid things. It's not the end of the world. Just move on and don't bother apologizing. You're not going to change the past, and he's probably already forgotten about it. Just focus on being more responsible in the future and maybe try to find someone who likes you for who you are, not just your potential."

Overall, the comments are a mix of advice, humor, and support, with some users telling the OP to apologize and make amends, while others suggest that she should just move on and not bother apologizing. The OP's post has received over 200 comments and has been upvoted over 1,000 times.

TITLE: [17/M]How do I start a conversation with a girl[16/m] who goes to my school and climbing gym.

POST: I joined a rock climbing gym over the summer and climbed a month before school started. When I first started to go there I saw this girl but didn't have any feelings for here. School then started up and noticed that she went to my school. I pass her in the halls a few times a day, which is always a little awkward when I kinda know someone but never really talked to them. One day out of no where I just started to really like the way this girl acted and looked, I have no idea why. I want to talk to her but I don't want to come off as forcing a conversation or some creep.

TL;DR: I like a girl who goes to my school and climbing gym, but I don't know how to start a conversation with her without coming off as creepy.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It can be super awkward to try to start a conversation with someone you don't know that well. Here's what I would suggest: try to find a common ground with her. Maybe you both like climbing or something else you have in common. You could say something like 'Hey, I saw you at the climbing gym the other day. How's your climbing going?' or 'I noticed you're in my school too. What's your favorite class?' Just be genuine and respectful, and I'm sure you'll be fine."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and be respectful. If she's interested in talking to you, she'll let you know. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. You could try striking up a conversation about something you both have in common, like climbing or school. Just remember to listen to her and be interested in what she has to say. Good luck!"
3. **u/climbing_guru**: "Hey OP, I'm a regular at the climbing gym too. I've seen you around, and I think you're a great climber. If you want to talk to the girl, I'd suggest trying to find a way to work together on a climb or something. That way, you can both focus on the climb and not feel too awkward. Just make sure to communicate with each other and be respectful. Good luck, and let me know if you need any more advice!"
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I agree with the other comments. You're saying you don't know why you like this girl, but you're willing to risk being rejected or coming off as creepy just to talk to her? Maybe take a step back and think about why you're really interested in her. Is it just because you think she's pretty or because you actually have a connection with her? If it's the former, maybe you should focus on building a connection with her rather than just trying to talk to her. Just my two cents."

---

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll try to find a common ground with her, like we both like climbing or something. And yeah, I guess I was overthinking it a bit. I'll just be myself and be respectful. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: Feeling really empty for the past little while.

POST: Hey guys,

I'm an 18 year old high school student who's in their final year. About 2 months ago I was accepted to my dream school, and as such I'll be going off their in August. I'm extremely happy about it, it's one of the best schools in my country, and the place itself is beautiful. Needless to say, this relatively early university acceptance was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. 

But for whatever reason, I can't find it in myself to be happy. Most kids my age would be ecstatic and hopeful for the future. And while I am happy that I'll be moving out on my own, I can't help but feel incredible emptiness. Every night I just waste away the day browsing internet forums or listening to music. My usual hobby of videogames can't grip me like it used to; any time I try a new game I lose interest after a few hours, maybe a few days if I'm lucky. The only thing that can hold my attention for more than a few days is reading books, but even with that, I have to take a break every half hour or else I zone out.

Do you guys have any advice for me? I have nothing to be sad about, my life is great as it is, but at the same time I don't feel happy about anything. I usually feel comfortable with my friends, but we've been talking less and less recently, due to conflicting schedules at school.

TL;DR: I'm 18, accepted to my dream school, but I can't find it in myself to be happy. I feel empty and uninterested in things I used to enjoy.

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think I can relate to what you're going through. I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I was accepted to my dream college, but I felt like I was just going through the motions. It took me a while to realize that I was feeling this way because I was trying to live up to other people's expectations, rather than my own. I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want to get out of your university experience. What are your goals? What do you want to achieve? What kind of person do you want to become? Once you have a clear idea of what you want, you can start making plans to make it happen. And don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. It's okay to not have it all figured out right away."

2. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, I think you're experiencing a classic case of 'post-acceptance blues.' It's normal to feel a little lost or unfulfilled after achieving a major goal. It's like, you've reached the top of the mountain, but now you're just standing there, wondering what's next. I would suggest taking some time to relax and enjoy the moment. You've earned it! But also, don't be afraid to seek out new experiences and challenges. You don't have to have it all figured out right away. Just take things one step at a time and see where life takes you."

3. **ConcernedCitizen**: "OP, I'm glad you're being honest about how you're feeling. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling. I think you should consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings. They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies. Additionally, you might want to try journaling or writing down your thoughts and feelings. Sometimes putting your thoughts down on paper can help you process and make sense of them. And don't forget to take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly."

4. **OldManYellsAtClouds**: "OP, I'm an old guy, but I've been around the block a few times. I've seen a lot of young people like you who are struggling to find their place in the world. My advice to you is to take your time and don't rush into anything. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and you don't have to have it all figured out right away. Just enjoy the journey and see where it takes you. And don't be afraid to make mistakes. That's where the real learning happens. Oh, and one more thing: don't worry too much about what other people think. You do you, and let the rest of the world worry about itself."

TITLE: I [26M] just started a new relationship, but not sure if I can trust her [26F]. Is this a red flag?

POST: So I met this girl at my best friends wedding two months ago. We really hit it off and I went to visit her across the country a week ago. I'm head over heels for her, but I don't want to get hurt.

A particular situation is nagging at me though. Last night she went to a movie in the park with her neighbor and his friend. I met them on my journey out there and thought they were weird but harmless.

She tells me today that they all got pretty drunk and one of the guys was hitting on her, the neighbor kept trying to put his arm around her, and one of their friends tried to make a move to kiss her at the end of the night. She said that she declined all of these advances and I don't have any reason to doubt her, but what bothers me the most is that the she let the guy who tried to kiss her sleep on her couch.

She says she's only interested in me and that she found those guys, desperate and creepy, but it bothers me that she didn't see it to begin with and that she didn't just flat out kick them out of her apartment. Is she just overly flirty/nice. Is this a red flag?

I already have trust issues and the LDR thing is compounding them. I'd love to have an honest discussion about it, but don't want to seem controlling or overly jealous.

TL;DR: Girlfriend went to a movie with her neighbor and his friend, got drunk, and one of the guys tried to kiss her. She declined and let him sleep on her couch. I'm worried about her judgment and trustworthiness.

RESPONSES:

1. **Trust issues are a real thing, and it's okay to acknowledge them.** It's great that you're recognizing your concerns and wanting to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend. Remember that trust is built over time, and it's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better. Don't be afraid to express your concerns and work through them together.

2. **It's not about being controlling or jealous; it's about being honest and clear.** You're not asking her to change who she is or how she behaves, but rather to understand your concerns and work together to build trust. Be specific about what's bothering you and why, and listen to her perspective as well. Remember that communication is key in any relationship.

3. **It's possible that she didn't realize the situation was as bad as you do.** Maybe she was genuinely unaware of how uncomfortable those guys were making her, or maybe she was trying to be polite and didn't want to make a scene. It's also possible that she was trying to be friendly and didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Try to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with her about it, and see how she responds.

4. **It's not a red flag if she's willing to work through it with you.** If your girlfriend is willing to listen to your concerns, acknowledge your feelings, and work together to build trust, then it's not a red flag. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we learn and grow from them that matters.

5. **Take a step back and consider the bigger picture.** While this situation might be concerning, it's not the only thing that matters in your relationship. Think about the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you happy. Don't let one situation define your entire relationship.

6. **It's okay to have different boundaries and expectations.** What might be a red flag for you might not be for someone else. It's okay to have different boundaries and expectations, and it's important to communicate those with your partner. Remember that compromise and understanding are key in any relationship.

7. **Don't assume the worst.** Try not to assume the worst about your girlfriend's intentions or behavior. Instead, focus on having an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Remember that people make mistakes, and it's how we learn and grow from them that matters.

8. **It's not about being 'overly flirty' or 'nice'; it's about being genuine.** Your girlfriend might be a genuinely friendly and outgoing person who doesn't realize the impact her behavior has on others. Try to understand her perspective and see if there's a way to work through this together.

9. **Take things slow and get to know each other better.** Remember that trust is built over time, and it's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better. Don't rush into anything, and focus on building a strong foundation for your relationship.

10. **Communicate, communicate, communicate.** Remember that communication is key in any relationship. Be open and honest with your girlfriend about your concerns, and listen to her perspective as well. Remember that trust is built on mutual understanding and respect.

TITLE: Feeling discouraged and a little lost - Need some advice.

POST: I'm sure these types of posts crop of from time to time, so I apologize if you've seen this all before.

I'm looking for a little advice.  To begin, I'll give you some background information.  I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force.  While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations.  I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have.  I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology.  I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010.  I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010.  I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers.  I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money.  I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking.  I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS?  A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

Thanks in advance; sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR: I'm feeling lost and unsure about my career path.  I want to work in computers, but I'm not sure where to start or if I should pursue further education.

RESUME:

[Insert resume]

**ADVICE FROM THE COMMUNITY:**

* "Hey OP, don't be too hard on yourself. You've had a non-traditional path, but that doesn't mean you can't make a change. Consider taking online courses or certifications to get your foot in the door. You can start with something like CompTIA A+ or Network+ to get a feel for the industry. Don't worry too much about the cost, you can always take it one step at a time."
* "I think you're selling yourself short by saying a Bachelor's degree is out of reach. You've already got an AAS, and that's a great foundation. Look into online Bachelor's programs that are more affordable and flexible. You can also consider taking individual courses or certifications to supplement your education."
* "Your experience in Radar Jamming Pods and Test Stations is actually pretty relevant to computer work. You've got a solid foundation in electronics and troubleshooting. Consider highlighting those skills on your resume and in job applications. You might be surprised at how transferable your skills are."
* "Don't give up on CTU just yet! Talk to your instructors and see if they can offer any additional support or guidance. You might be able to find a way to make it work with your schedule. And if not, there are plenty of other online programs and courses out there that can help you get started."
* "Web design is a great skill to have! Consider building a portfolio of your work and showcasing it on platforms like Behance or GitHub. This can help you stand out when applying for jobs or freelance work."
* "Remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You're not alone in feeling lost or uncertain. Take small steps towards your goals, and don't be afraid to ask for help or advice along the way."



**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* Don't be too hard on yourself and consider taking small steps towards your goals.
* Look into online courses or certifications to get started in the computer field.
* Highlight transferable skills from previous experience.
* Consider online Bachelor's programs or individual courses to supplement education.
* Don't give up on CTU or other programs without exploring options for support or guidance.
* Build a portfolio of work to showcase skills and experience.
* Take small steps and don't be afraid to ask for help or advice along the way.

TITLE: Reddit, when I was young I was tested for my IQ and I was told it was in the upper 140s. Nowadays, I don't feel as smart. Is video games really killing my intelligence?

POST: When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again. So, what is my problem? Is there anything I can do to regain my sharpness and should I start cutting out my excessive hours of video games?

TL;DR: I had a high IQ as a kid, but now I don't feel as smart. I'm wondering if playing video games is affecting my intelligence.

COMMENTS:

1. "I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're not going to lose your intelligence because of video games. You're just experiencing the natural decline in cognitive abilities that comes with age and lack of mental stimulation."
2. "I'm not a doctor, but I think you might be experiencing a bit of a plateau. You're not getting any younger, and your brain is still developing. Maybe try taking a break from video games and focus on other activities that challenge your mind."
3. "I'm a gamer myself, and I can attest that video games can be mentally stimulating. Maybe try playing different types of games that challenge you in different ways. You might find that you're more engaged and mentally sharp."
4. "I think you're just experiencing the effects of prolonged screen time. Try taking breaks and doing some physical activity. Your brain will thank you."
5. "I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist, but I think the government is controlling our minds through video games. Just kidding, but seriously, try taking a break and doing something that doesn't involve a screen."
6. "I think you're just experiencing the effects of boredom. Try finding new hobbies or activities that challenge you and keep you engaged."
7. "I'm a gamer and I can attest that video games can be mentally stimulating. Maybe try playing different types of games that challenge you in different ways. You might find that you're more engaged and mentally sharp."
8. "I think you're just experiencing the effects of aging. Our brains naturally decline with age, and it's not just limited to video games. Try taking care of yourself and staying mentally active."
9. "I think you're just experiencing the effects of a lack of sleep. Try getting more rest and see if that improves your mental clarity."
10. "I think you're just experiencing the effects of a lack of mental stimulation. Try taking a break from video games and focus on other activities that challenge your mind."

This post and its comments demonstrate the various perspectives and opinions on the topic of video games and their potential impact on intelligence. Some commenters believe that video games can be mentally stimulating and even improve cognitive abilities, while others think that prolonged screen time can have negative effects on the brain. The original poster's concerns about their own perceived decline in intelligence are met with a range of responses, from suggestions that they may be experiencing a natural decline in cognitive abilities to recommendations that they take breaks from video games and engage in other activities that challenge their mind. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and diversity of opinions on this topic.

TITLE: Getting a new job where I need to incorporate (S Corp) and am lost when it comes to taxes and salaries (and dividends, oh my!)

POST: Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm going to be starting a new job soon at 130k a year, with a rather special circumstance. As part of the terms of me being hired, I need to set up a S Corp, and essentially be business to business in terms of the relationship with the company.

I know it sounds super sketchy for a company to require me to do that, but it makes sense in context. I am 20 years old, and HR would never green light 130k for a 20 year old dude, so this is the solution that was proposed.

I understand that I take on more taxes because of me being self employed (the other half of the taxes normally paid by the employer), but I am lost as to how to count anything. I should be paying myself a salary, and then paying the rest through dividends correct? Are there any sort of step by step guides on how to do this correctly?

Also, is there a way (short of sitting down with a CPA) to calculate my take home pay when counting dividends and federal/state/local taxes? I looked online at tax calculators, and they either seem too simple, or vary wildly. Some say that I would owe 10k total per year (seems too low) and some say that I would owe 50k total per year (seems wayyy to high).

Furthermore (sorry for the wall of text), I'd like to setup some sort of retirement account (or accounts), but since I will be self employed I'm not sure what avenue to take.

I have contacted a CPA in the area to setup an appointment to get incorporated, but was looking for some advice from more voices on the questions above. Thanks!

TL;DR: New job requires me to set up a S Corp, and I'm lost on how to handle taxes, salaries, and dividends. Looking for step by step guides and advice on calculating take home pay and setting up retirement accounts.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Congratulations on the new job! As a S Corp owner, you'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary (around 50-60k) and then take the rest as dividends. You'll also need to pay self-employment taxes on the dividends. I'd recommend consulting with a CPA to get a better understanding of your tax situation. As for retirement accounts, you can set up a SEP-IRA or a solo 401(k) as a S Corp owner."
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I'd recommend using a tax calculator that takes into account self-employment taxes and dividends. You can try using TurboTax or H&R Block's self-employment tax calculator. As for retirement accounts, you can also consider a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. However, as a S Corp owner, you may be limited in the amount you can contribute to these accounts."
3. **u/retireearly**: "As a S Corp owner, you'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary to avoid any potential issues with the IRS. You can use the IRS's self-employment tax calculator to estimate your taxes. As for retirement accounts, you can set up a solo 401(k) or a SEP-IRA. These accounts allow you to contribute up to 20% of your net earnings from self-employment, up to a maximum of $57,000 in 2023."
4. **u/taxpro**: "As a S Corp owner, you'll need to file Form 1120S and Schedule K-1. You'll also need to pay self-employment taxes on the dividends. I'd recommend consulting with a CPA to get a better understanding of your tax situation. As for retirement accounts, you can set up a SEP-IRA or a solo 401(k) as a S Corp owner. These accounts allow you to contribute up to 20% of your net earnings from self-employment, up to a maximum of $57,000 in 2023."

**Additional Tips:**

* Consult with a CPA to get a better understanding of your tax situation and to ensure compliance with IRS regulations.
* Use tax calculators that take into account self-employment taxes and dividends to estimate your take-home pay.
* Consider setting up a SEP-IRA or a solo 401(k) as a S Corp owner to take advantage of retirement account contributions.
* Pay yourself a reasonable salary to avoid any potential issues with the IRS.
* Keep accurate records of your business income and expenses to ensure accurate tax reporting.

TITLE: I[19F] believe I am bi-sexual, should I come out? Identified to bf[20M], and I don't know how to proceed. [x-post from /r/sex]

POST: Well. I will start off by saying that I told my SO that I thought I was bi-sexual today, and he seemed to treat it as water off a duck's back. I was thoroughly surprised since he is a little jealous sometimes when it comes to other men, but I guess he could just call it "hot" if he really isn't taking me seriously.

Anyways, that's not the point, I was always a little curious, but never acted upon the fantasies I had. I always would think of women giving me oral, or I always thought that breasts were so nice, and kind of got turned on by them.

Here is where things get a little complicated. I do believe I am bi-sexual, but never got the chance to act on it. Once when I was in high school me and one of my closest friends got drunkenly dared to kiss each other, and we did. What would she think if I came out as bi? And my best friend is gay, we never did anything, but would this complicate the relationship? I'm pretty scared to tell people- should I?

Also, some parts of my family aren't that accepting of non-heterosexual relationships, so if I came out, should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

How would I go about it?

I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I think I'm bi-sexual, told my SO, and he seemed fine with it. I'm scared to come out to others, especially my best friend who is gay, and my family isn't very accepting. Should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

---

**Comments:**

* "Hey, congrats on taking the first step by telling your SO! It's normal to be scared, but it's great that you're considering coming out. I think you should start with small steps, like talking to your close friends and family members one-on-one. It might be helpful to have a support system in place before you come out to your best friend who is gay. Also, it's okay if not everyone is accepting, but it's important to surround yourself with people who love and support you for who you are."
* "I'm bi-sexual too, and I can relate to your feelings. It's great that your SO is accepting, but it's also important to remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your sexuality. You do you, and if people can't accept that, then they're not worth your time. As for your best friend who is gay, I think it's important to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings. It might be helpful to frame it as a personal journey of self-discovery, rather than a rejection of their sexuality."
* "I think it's great that you're considering coming out, but I also think it's important to remember that you don't have to do it publicly. You can come out to your close friends and family, and still keep your sexuality private from others. It's your decision, and you should do what feels right for you. Also, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and concerns. They can provide you with a safe and supportive space to explore your sexuality and work through any anxiety or fear you may be feeling."
* "I'm a bit surprised that your SO seemed fine with it, but I guess that's a good thing! As for your best friend who is gay, I think it's important to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings. It might be helpful to frame it as a personal journey of self-discovery, rather than a rejection of their sexuality. And as for your family, I think it's important to remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your sexuality. You do you, and if people can't accept that, then they're not worth your time."

TITLE: When should I [M24] offer to start paying for things at my girlfriends [F26] place? Or at all?

POST: We've been together officially for a little over a month now, but have been dating for closer to four months. I've known her almost three years now.

Since things became official I've been spending nearly all my time at her place. She gave me a key and has said that it's half my home too. So my dog and I are there now all the time. I still have my own apartment (six months left on the lease). We've talked some about me moving in, which will happen officially once my lease is up. But if I'm spending all my time at her place, using heat, water, electricity, etc... Shouldn't I help pay for something? Or is it too soon to talk about that kind of thing?

Her internet is very slow DSL and she's off contract.. I've thought about offering to have my much faster cable internet moved to her place and just keep paying it myself.. Thoughts?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a month, I've been spending a lot of time at her place, and I'm wondering if it's too soon to start paying for some things or if I should just wait until I move in officially.

COMMENTS:

* "It's not too soon to start contributing to expenses, especially since you're using her resources regularly. You could start by offering to pay for specific things, like internet or utilities, and see how she reacts. If she's okay with it, you can gradually increase your contributions as you spend more time at her place."
* "I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with your girlfriend about your expenses and expectations. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've been spending a lot of time at your place and I want to make sure I'm contributing fairly. Would you be okay with me paying for [specific expense]?' This way, you're showing that you're considerate of her resources and willing to work together to find a solution."
* "It's not just about the money, it's about the principle. If you're not contributing to expenses, it can start to feel like you're taking advantage of her hospitality. By offering to pay for things, you're showing that you respect her and her resources."
* "I think it's a bit premature to start paying for things, especially since you're not officially living together yet. You could wait until you move in officially and then discuss expenses with your girlfriend. That way, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I would suggest having a conversation with your girlfriend about your expectations and boundaries. You could say something like, 'Hey, I love spending time at your place, but I also want to make sure I'm not taking advantage of your resources. Can we talk about what you're comfortable with in terms of expenses?' This way, you're showing that you're considerate of her feelings and willing to work together to find a solution."

Overall, the comments suggest that it's a good idea to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your expenses and expectations. It's not just about the money, but also about showing respect for her resources and hospitality. Some people suggest waiting until you're officially living together, while others think it's okay to start contributing to expenses now. Ultimately, the decision is up to you and your girlfriend to discuss and decide what works best for both of you.

TITLE: Would you consider it unhealthy to hate people?

POST: It's not like I'm talking about going around and murdering random people, but I don't have very many nice things to say about them.

I think they are pieces of trash that are led by personal and selfish desires and if deemed necessary Would not hesitate to kill a motherfucker. So maybe I sort of lied about the murdering thing, but I really don't believe that people are worth keeping around. We sit around and manipulate each other until we get what we want. I see most people as mindless animals that are just taking up space and fucking each other so that they can produce more mindless garbage. It just sickens me to see and hear what people do to others.

I mean sure there are the people who actually go out of their way to make a difference and try their best to be good people but I feel like those people are so few and far apart. I believe that all people have the potential to be amazing, but I also believe that people have the potential to be horrible monsters, and I think that most people go in the bad direction.

I don't know, maybe I am just some dumb high-schooler (17 years old in case you were wondering) who is too stupid to see that people aren't shitty. Maybe you people can show me the way. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to not hate people?

TL;DR: I hate people and think they're mostly selfish and manipulative. I don't think they're worth keeping around and think most people are just taking up space. I'm 17 and don't know if I'm just being stupid or if there's something wrong with me.

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT**

**u/throwaway1234567**: Dude, you're 17 and you're already so jaded. I get it, high school can be tough, but trust me, it's not all bad. There are good people out there, and you'll find them if you keep an open mind. Try volunteering or joining a club that aligns with your interests. You might be surprised at how many people are genuinely kind and caring.

**u/optimist123**: I think you're being a bit harsh on people. Sure, there are some bad apples out there, but there are also a lot of good people who are trying to make a difference. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of human nature instead of the negative. You might find that it changes your perspective.

**u/skeptical_sam**: I think you're being a bit dramatic. People are complex, and they're not all good or all bad. Maybe try to understand where people are coming from instead of judging them based on your own biases. And hey, if you're really that unhappy with the world, maybe try to make a change instead of just complaining about it.

**u/compassionate_cathy**: I think you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and frustrated with the world. That's totally normal, especially at 17. But instead of hating people, maybe try to focus on building connections with others. You might find that having positive relationships with people can help you feel more fulfilled and happy.

**u/realistic_rachel**: Honestly, I think you're just going through a phase. You're 17, and you're still figuring out who you are and what you want. Give it a few years, and you'll probably look back on this and realize that you were being a bit dramatic. Just try to focus on your own personal growth and development, and don't worry too much about what other people are doing.

TITLE: My (16F) boyfriend (16M) hasn't gotten me a gift yet... our anniversary was a little over two weeks ago.

POST: I don't know whether my being upset is valid or not, and I'd like some insight.

Our 2 year anniversary was July 20th and I got him a cologne, a little bag of the candies he likes, and a new CD, along with a few more personal items. He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.

It sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me. This has happened at least 3 times already. Honestly I've lost excitement in going because I feel like it's never going to happen.

I can't bring it up to him because whenever I do he gets really upset and apologizes a lot, which I appreciate, but I just would rather him say that he can't take me (if that's the case) rather than continue to drag this out.

I feel bad for being upset, because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck. But it doesn't change the fact that he's been promising and not coming through, which is upsetting. 

I need an outsider's opinion so I can have some unbiased opinions to look through.

TL;DR: My 16 year old boyfriend hasn't gotten me a gift yet for our 2 year anniversary, despite making plans and promising to take me to Sephora. He always has an excuse for not having the money, and I'm feeling upset and frustrated. Is my reaction valid, or am I being too harsh?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not taking your anniversary seriously and is just making empty promises. You deserve better than that. If he can't follow through on his plans, then maybe he's not the right person for you."
* "I think you're being too harsh. He's 16, and he's on a limited budget. Maybe he's just not good with money or planning. Try to have a calm conversation with him about it and see if you can work something out."
* "I agree with the first commenter. If he can't even follow through on a simple plan, then what does that say about his commitment to your relationship? You deserve someone who can prioritize you and your feelings."
* "I think you're overthinking this. It's just a gift, and it's not the end of the world. Maybe he's just really busy or stressed out. Try to relax and focus on the positive aspects of your relationship."
* "I think you should talk to him about it and express your feelings. Maybe he's not even aware of how you're feeling. Communication is key in any relationship, and it sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unheard."
* "I think you're being too focused on the gift itself and not the thought behind it. Maybe he's been planning something bigger and more meaningful, but it's taking him a little longer to get it together. Try to have an open and honest conversation with him about it."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Is this really worth getting upset over? Maybe you're putting too much pressure on him and the relationship. Try to relax and focus on the things that truly matter."
* "I think you're being unfair. He's 16, and he's still learning how to manage his finances and prioritize his time. Cut him some slack and try to be understanding. Maybe he'll surprise you with something amazing in the future."
* "I think you should talk to him about it and set some clear expectations for your anniversary celebrations. Maybe you can compromise and find something that works for both of you. Communication is key, and it sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unheard."

TITLE: My fitness pal help needed.

POST: I have just started a journey to a new an healthier me as I realised that turning 25 being 236lbs at 5'9" was not a good way to end a year. 
I have been cooking healthier meals and working out almost daily for 25-35 mins of cardio, and I recently started using fitbit and MFP together. 
I am as honest as I can be without kitchen scales (which I am buying this weekend) about the weight of all the foods and therefore the calories that I am eating but I find that MFP is nagging at me to eat more. 
Today I have cooked a HUUUGE meal for lunchtime that I think would serve about three people. Lots of fresh veg, a bit of skinless chicken and some quiona, when I put the amount of food into MFP it tells me the calories are too low and I am putting my body into starvation mode, I am not sure I will be able to eat even half of this meal, but I am worried that if I don't eat more my body won't be able to repair itself.
On an average day I will eat about 1200 calories, consisting of porridge & honey for breakfast, lunch of a meat, veg and quinoa/couscous and dinner of fresh veg, meat and sometimes potatoes. 
I don't often find myself hungry and I drink about 2-3l of water a day, if I have less I get a massive headache from the central heating system. So I was wondering if anyone else finds MFP nagging at them to eat more calories. Even on the meals that I cheat with and have a pizza MFP is still telling me I am under my calorie limit although those days are the only days it doesn't nag me about starvation mode.

TL;DR: I'm trying to lose weight, using MFP and Fitbit. MFP is telling me I'm eating too few calories and I'm worried about starving my body. I'm eating 1200 calories a day, but MFP is nagging me to eat more. Has anyone else had this issue?

---

This post is a great example of how MyFitnessPal (MFP) can be frustrating for users, especially those who are trying to lose weight. The user is trying to be honest about their food intake, but MFP is telling them they're not eating enough calories. This can be demotivating and make the user feel like they're not doing enough to support their weight loss goals.

The user is also worried about starving their body, which is a common concern for people who are trying to lose weight. They're concerned that if they don't eat enough calories, their body won't be able to repair itself and they'll lose muscle mass.

The post is also a great example of how important it is to listen to your body and not just rely on a calorie tracking app. The user is drinking 2-3 liters of water a day and is not often hungry, which suggests that they may be getting enough calories and nutrients. It's also important to note that everyone's nutritional needs are different, and what works for one person may not work for another.

The community responds to the post with a mix of advice and reassurance. Some users suggest that the user may be underestimating their calorie needs, while others reassure them that it's normal to feel like they're not eating enough calories when they're trying to lose weight. The community also provides some tips and tricks for dealing with MFP's nagging, such as using the app's "custom" feature to adjust their calorie needs.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/loseit community can provide support and guidance for people who are trying to lose weight and improve their overall health. The community is full of people who are going through similar experiences and can offer valuable advice and reassurance.

TITLE: Me [24F] with men - Can't trust them

POST: My relationships haven't worked out lately and I have realized that I have never NOT been cheated on by someone. I struggle with depression, have been to therapy, and know I am not always easy to be around but I know I don't deserve this. 

I am having an increasingly difficult time forming healthy relationships because I just don't trust men with my heart and in turn, I can't let my guard down and really let a relationship develop. My self-esteem is pretty wrecked, too. I am really unsure what to do because like everyone, I want connection and love. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I've never had a healthy relationship with a man, always been cheated on. Struggling with depression and self-esteem. Need advice on how to move forward and trust someone again.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's not your fault that you've been cheated on, and it's not because you're not 'easy to be around.' It sounds like you're already taking steps to work on yourself by going to therapy and recognizing your struggles. That's huge! As for trust, it might be helpful to focus on building trust with yourself first. What are some things you can do to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs? Maybe start small, like taking a relaxing bath or going for a walk. Once you feel more grounded in yourself, you might find it easier to open up to someone else. Just a thought!"
2. **u/relationship_advice_guru**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough to trust people when you've been hurt so many times. But here's the thing: you can't change the past, and you can't control how others behave. What you can control is how you respond to those situations. Instead of focusing on the fact that you've been cheated on, try to focus on what you want in a relationship and what you're willing to work on to make it happen. Are there any specific things you're looking for in a partner? Are there any deal-breakers for you? Once you have a clear idea of what you want, you can start looking for someone who aligns with those values. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know someone before committing to a relationship. You don't have to rush into anything that makes you uncomfortable."
3. **u/anonymous_user_123**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. I've been in similar situations before, and it's tough. But I want to tell you that you are not alone. There are people out there who care about you and want to help. Have you considered talking to a trusted friend or family member about what you're going through? Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. And if you're not comfortable talking to someone in person, there are also online support groups and forums where you can connect with others who are going through similar things. You don't have to face this alone, OP. Remember that you are strong and capable, and you deserve to be happy."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "OP, I love your honesty and willingness to share your struggles. That takes a lot of courage! As a relationship coach, I've worked with many people who have been through similar experiences. One thing that might be helpful is to focus on building a sense of self-worth and self-love. When you feel good about yourself, you're less likely to attract people who don't respect you. Have you considered doing things that make you feel good about yourself, like taking a class or pursuing a hobby? When you're doing things that bring you joy, you're more likely to attract people who appreciate you for who you are. And remember, it's okay to take your time and focus on yourself before getting into a relationship. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and that's worth waiting for."

**Key Takeaways:**

* OP is struggling with trust issues due to past experiences of being cheated on.
* OP is taking steps to work on themselves, including therapy and self-care.
* Commenters offer advice on building trust with oneself, focusing on what one wants in a relationship, and seeking support from others.
* The importance of self-worth, self-love, and self-care is emphasized as a way to attract positive relationships.

TITLE: NSV, I now take a bike and the stairs to work.

POST: As far as my weight goes, the short story is that I somehow got to be over 260 pounds at 5'9"-ish, and then lost about 80 pounds. That was a few years ago. I was in damn good shape. Could run, was thinking about joining the armed forces. Everything was awesome...

A few years later, and I fell off. I turn 24 next week, and I was recently juuuuust over 300 pounds. I live almost exactly 100 miles north of New York City. Last semester IU started commuting to the city for work and school. I still live up north, because I have another job up there. Train tickets got expensive, so I saved money by biking instead of taking the subway.

I only just started eating healthier a couple weeks ago, but I'm down about 10-15 pounds right now. Just hit 286, and I'm very happy. I know it isn't really progress, but it's nice to know that it's all improvement from here. I've done it before, and I can do it again. I know I won't let myself fall off.

So the first few times I took a bike a few miles from Grand Central Terminal to my job, only a few miles, I was so tired the next day. Mostly just my legs (Coat + Backpack didnt help >.<). Anyway, it has been getting easier, and I think now that it's warm I'll take up some weekend leisure rides. :)

Also, about 20 minutes ago, I took the elevator down to street level to go buy some food, and realized I forgot my wallet, which means I forgot my elevator key. I could have asked the door man, but instead just took the stairs 21 floors up. I was almost out of breath at the top, and I'm sure I will get muscle cramps tomorrow, but it was so worth it. :)

TL;DR: I'm down 10-15 pounds, and I'm taking the stairs and biking to work. It's getting easier, and I'm feeling good about it.

COMMENTS:

* Congrats on the weight loss and the new habits! You're doing great!
* That's amazing! I'm so proud of you for taking control of your health again. You're an inspiration!
* I'm so impressed! I've been trying to get into biking, but I'm a total newbie. Can you tell me more about your experience with biking to work?
* You're doing great! Keep it up! I'm sure the weight loss will come with time. Just remember to be patient and focus on progress, not perfection.
* I'm so proud of you for taking the stairs! That's a huge accomplishment, especially when you're not used to it. Keep pushing yourself and you'll be amazed at what you can do!
* You're an inspiration! I'm trying to get back into shape myself, and seeing your progress is motivating me to keep going. Thanks for sharing your story!

TITLE: I'm going there: I cannot bring myself to finish LOTR.

POST: **Notice: I mean no disrespect to fans so please don't take this the wrong way.**

...but I'm more than open to having my mind changed if someone can explain to me what I'm missing.

My job has an hour-long commute, so I joined the library and have been going through podcasts and audiobooks like crazy. 

While sifting through their audiobook collection I saw they had all of the LOTR books, which I've never read -- I wanted to as a teenager but never got around to it. I never watched the movies because I wanted to read the books first because I'm a nerd like that. I knew absolutely nothing about the series other than the brief introduction I had to it while playing the Interplay LOTR adventure game on PC in the mid-90's for half an hour once.

So for the first few discs I found it a little monotonous. Lots of awkward singing by the narrator, lots of painfully long descriptions of the Shire and lots of genealogy for minor characters, which I found odd. But I assumed it'd pick up since I had 14 discs left to go.

I'm currently on disc 9 (right as they're getting to Rivendell) but I absolutely cannot get interested in it, though not for lack of trying. Each commute it gets more difficult for me to keep listening rather than just throw on music or the news. Every time I get to a new disc I feel like I just finished several hours of homework and I have to bargain with myself to start the next one. 

It's not that I don't like it. I like Tolkien's style, the characters are ridiculously well-developed and I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was in the 1950's...I just can't figure out what's so interesting and exciting about it to so many people, and I certainly can't imagine spending 50+ more hours finishing out the entire trilogy. 

Can someone change my mind before I bail and take it back to the library on Tuesday? 

If it matters in your analysis, my normal taste is Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and non-fiction about science, politics and religion. My favorite book is Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett.

TL;DR: I'm having trouble finishing LOTR on audiobook and can't figure out what I'm missing. Help me understand why it's so beloved and maybe change my mind about finishing it. 

---

**Comments:**

* "I think the key is to remember that LOTR is a product of its time. It's a slow burn, but the payoff is worth it. Try to focus on the characters and their relationships rather than the plot. And don't worry if you don't love it, it's okay to not finish it."
* "I think you're missing the point of LOTR. It's not about the plot, it's about the world-building and the characters. Tolkien spent years creating this world and the stories within it. It's a masterpiece of world-building."
* "I agree with you, the beginning can be slow. But once you get to the Fellowship and the journey begins, it picks up. And the characters are so well-developed. I think you should give it another chance."
* "I'm a huge fan of Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut, and I can see why you might not connect with LOTR. But it's a different kind of story. It's more focused on the characters and the world than on plot twists and action. Give it another chance, you might be surprised."
* "I think you're being too harsh. The singing is a bit much, but it's not the worst thing in the world. And the descriptions of the Shire are beautiful. Try to appreciate the world-building and the characters, and you might find yourself getting more into it."
* "I'm a big fan of Good Omens, and I can see why you might like it. But LOTR is a different kind of story. It's more serious and epic in scope. Give it another chance, you might find that you enjoy it more than you think."

**Postscript:** The OP did end up finishing the book, and they reported that they enjoyed the second half of the trilogy more than the first. They appreciated the world-building and the characters, and they found the story to be more engaging. They still didn't love it as much as some of their other favorite books, but they were glad they had given it a chance.

TITLE: Me [22F] with my Boyfriend [22M] 4 years, he wants to move in together and I'm not ready.

POST: So like the title says, we've been together 4 years, since we were 18 and all through our college years. Now that we've both graduated and are landing steady jobs we are looking to move out. He thinks it would make the most sense to move in together and has also mentioned getting engaged but not getting married for a while. I don't want to get engaged or married until my late 20s (that's always been my plan). I also side with my traditional mom and grandma who do not think moving in together is okay until we are at least planning a wedding. 

I can totally see myself marrying him if we are still together in several years. But I can also see things coming between us. I'm dead set on living in another country, and I might actually have to spend six months in another country within the next couple of years. He has always mentioned that he wants to stay in the town we live in now. I am also very chronically sick (nothing terminal, but sometimes debilitating) and he doesn't handle that very well when I'm going through a flare. 

I definitely love him with my whole heart and everyone thinks we're perfect together, but I'm still hesitant. How do I tell him I don't want to move in together and get engaged yet without hurting his feelings and making him think I don't love him?

TL;DR: 22F, 4 years with boyfriend, he wants to move in together and get engaged, but I'm not ready. I'm hesitant because of my plans to live abroad, my chronic illness, and my desire to wait until my late 20s to get married. How do I tell him without hurting his feelings?

TITLE: I [M/18] think my stepmother [F/44] is overstepping her boundaries

POST: For the past couple of years my father [M/52] has been married to my stepmother [F/44] and I [M/18] think she is overstepping boundaries and is taking advantage of my father in many situations.

Now, first of all, she isn't some horrible step mother, but she isn't great either. She doesn't have any kids of her own so she tries to punish me as if I was her kid, which my father allows. This would honestly not be a big deal, if she seemed sane...

She nitpicks at everything I do one week, and then loves me the next. The littlest thing can trigger her, such as what happened tonight.

I ran out of batteries in my remote, so I replaced them with the batteries in my dad's remote, which were in his bedroom. I do this a lot, and then hide the used batteries somewhere obvious so he puts them in and then the remote still doesn't work.

Nothing happened for a while, so I assumed they just replaced the batteries, so I fell asleep. I was awakened to screaming and yelling and slamming of the opening of my door. My stepmother was yelling about how 'going into their room was an invasion of privacy'... I would understand that if the door was locked... Or closed... Or not wide open... Or if I was never allowed to go in there before... But, no. It had never been an issue before. She now told me that she doesn't trust me, and doesn't think she will be able to sleep in the same house as me...

She walked out, still yelling and shouting, and I told my father that I think it is essentially bullshit what she is doing, but all he does is nod and agree with her and say 'I need to stay on the same page as her. That's what a marriage is.'

TL;DR: My stepmother is overstepping boundaries and taking advantage of my father, and I think she is being unfair and unreasonable. I don't know how to deal with this situation.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in blended families, where a stepmother may overstep her boundaries and create tension between her stepchild and her spouse. The OP (original poster) feels that his stepmother is being unfair and unreasonable, and is seeking advice on how to deal with the situation.

The post highlights several issues:

1. Lack of boundaries: The stepmother is overstepping her boundaries and treating the OP as if he were her own child, which can be damaging to their relationship.
2. Unpredictability: The stepmother's behavior is unpredictable, and the OP never knows when she will become angry or upset.
3. Lack of communication: The OP's father is not communicating effectively with him, and is instead siding with his wife.
4. Power imbalance: The stepmother has a significant amount of power in the household, and the OP feels that she is taking advantage of this to control him.

The post also raises questions about how to deal with this situation, such as:

1. How can the OP set boundaries with his stepmother?
2. How can the OP communicate effectively with his father about the issues he is facing?
3. How can the OP maintain a healthy relationship with his father despite the challenges posed by his stepmother?

Overall, this post highlights the complexities of blended family dynamics and the importance of effective communication, boundaries, and conflict resolution. It also underscores the need for stepmothers to be aware of their own behavior and to respect the boundaries of their stepchildren.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my ex[20 F] did I handle this correctly?

POST: So we broke up about 2 weeks ago after 4 months or so of dating because she said she wasn't feeling the way she did before to which I said fine but I would remove her from everything (not blocked or anything) we used as communication because I did not want to deal with the one sided feelings in order to get over it, she said for me to do whatever I need.

Thing is the past few days I've just been wondering was this the right thing to do? It was my first real relationship so I don't know if I come off like an asshole by doing what I did as i'd like to be friends with her later when feelings are not involved.

TL;DR: Broke up with my ex 2 weeks ago, removed her from all communication channels, now wondering if I handled it correctly and if I can still be friends with her later.

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: seeking advice on how to navigate a recent breakup. The OP (original poster) is a 21-year-old man who broke up with his 20-year-old ex-girlfriend two weeks ago after a four-month relationship. He removed her from all communication channels, including social media and messaging apps, in order to "get over it" and move on.

The OP is now questioning whether he handled the breakup correctly and is seeking advice on whether he can still be friends with his ex in the future. He is worried that by removing her from his life, he may have come across as an "asshole" and is unsure if this will affect their potential future friendship.

The post is a good example of the types of questions and concerns that people may have after a breakup, and the subreddit provides a platform for people to share their experiences and receive advice and support from others who have gone through similar situations. The post also highlights the importance of communication and empathy in relationships, and how a breakup can be a difficult and emotional experience for all parties involved.

TITLE: TIFU by assuming the toilets in my building were "fits it ships" toilets

POST: This happened a few months ago...

I'm a grad student, so I work most weekends. This is important later. Over the summer, I had made it a habit of going poo in the second floor bathroom. It's a single toilet and the best in the building. Knowing I could easily clog my home toilet during my healthy eating binge and having heard from my male friends of the industrial flushing power of the campus toilets, I decided to make using this toilet my routine.

Until the fuck up. This one particular poo did not fit nor ship, thus rendering the toilet useless. It was a Friday afternoon, and the cleaning crew doesn't come in on the weekends. And Monday was a holiday. Ugh. Oh well, I thought. I still had the men's room. Weekends weren't busy, so I wasn't concerned.

Saturday comes around and I use the men's bathroom as a backup. It didn't fit nor ship on Saturday, either. After that, I had to walk to the opposite side of the building and down a floor to use the bathroom until Thursday because they had to call a professional plumber...

TL;DR: I clogged the toilet in my building by assuming it was a "fits it ships" toilet and now I have to walk a whole floor and across the building to use the bathroom.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by assuming the toilets in my building were 'fits it ships' toilets" is a great title. I'm already laughing.
* "I'm a grad student, so I work most weekends" is the most relatable part of this post.
* "Knowing I could easily clog my home toilet during my healthy eating binge" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person eating a whole pizza by themselves.
* "And having heard from my male friends of the industrial flushing power of the campus toilets" is a great way to phrase it. I'm picturing a group of guys talking about toilets.
* "I decided to make using this toilet my routine" is a great way to phrase it. I'm imagining a person thinking, "Ah, I'll just use this toilet every time, it's fine."
* "Until the fuck up" is a great way to phrase it. I'm imagining a person saying, "Oh no, I did it again."
* "It was a Friday afternoon, and the cleaning crew doesn't come in on the weekends" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person thinking, "Oh, I'll just leave it for Monday."
* "And Monday was a holiday" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person thinking, "Oh, I'll just leave it for Tuesday."
* "Ugh. Oh well, I thought. I still had the men's room" is a great way to phrase it. I'm imagining a person thinking, "Well, at least I have this."
* "Weekends weren't busy, so I wasn't concerned" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person thinking, "It's fine, no one will notice."
* "After that, I had to walk to the opposite side of the building and down a floor to use the bathroom until Thursday" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person walking around the building, looking for a bathroom.
* "because they had to call a professional plumber" is a great detail. I'm imagining a person saying, "Oh no, I had to call the plumber."
* "TL;DR: I clogged the toilet in my building by assuming it was a 'fits it ships' toilet and now I have to walk a whole floor and across the building to use the bathroom" is a great summary. I'm imagining a person saying, "Yeah, I did that.""

This post is a great example of how a simple mistake can lead to a series of unfortunate events. The person in the post assumed that the toilet was a "fits it ships" toilet, which led to them clogging the toilet. Then, they had to walk a whole floor and across the building to use the bathroom, which was inconvenient and embarrassing. The post is a great example of how a simple mistake can have unintended consequences. It's also a great example of how a person can learn from their mistakes and move on. The person in the post learned that they should not assume that a toilet is a "fits it ships" toilet and that they should be more careful when using public restrooms. They also learned that it's okay to make mistakes and that they can always find a way to fix them. Overall, the post is a great example of how a simple mistake can lead to a series of unfortunate events, but also how a person can learn from their mistakes and move on.

TITLE: After finishing Week 3 Day 3 of C25K I am noticing an unintended benefit of my new lifestyle....(x-post from r/C25K)

POST: Every day of this week, I have pushed myself to increase my pace while doing the workout. I am running on a treadmill since I already have a gym membership so I can measure exactly how much faster I am going. I went from day 1 at 6.5 miles per hour to Day 2 at 6.7mph and then today all my run intervals were at 7mph. Even though each workout is the same, I found that this keeps it challenging instead of resorting back to the idea that its something I've already achieved.

So here's the unintended part: I have noticed that with my continued success in losing weight, dieting properly, and keeping to my exercise goals that my confidence in myself is going up. I know that is to be expected but its also effecting my ability to be better in other areas of my life that I never could stick with like my hygiene, my schedule, my budget, keeping in touch with people, etc etc. It's like seeing that when I am determined to do something I can achieve is pushing me to reassess those other things and know that I can improve them too. I get more enjoyment out of striving to be an all around better adult and improving myself now so I have seen much more improvement in all aspects of my life. It's a great feeling as there things have been nagging me for years.

TL;DR: I'm on Week 3 Day 3 of C25K and I've noticed that my increased confidence from losing weight and sticking to my exercise routine is spilling over into other areas of my life, such as my hygiene, schedule, budget, and relationships.

COMMENTS:

* "This is amazing! I'm on Week 1 Day 1 and I'm already seeing improvements in my confidence. I'm excited to see how it affects other areas of my life as I continue with the program."
* "I completely agree! I started a new job a few months ago and I was struggling to adjust. But since I started exercising regularly, I've noticed a huge difference in my confidence and ability to tackle new challenges. It's amazing how much of an impact it can have on other areas of your life."
* "I love this post! It's so inspiring to see how exercise can have a ripple effect on other areas of your life. Keep up the good work and I'm sure you'll continue to see improvements in all areas!"
* "I'm glad to hear that you're seeing improvements in your confidence. It's a great feeling, isn't it? I've noticed that when I'm feeling good about myself, I'm more likely to take on new challenges and push myself to be better. Keep up the good work and don't be afraid to take on new challenges!"
* "I'm on Week 2 Day 2 and I'm already seeing improvements in my confidence. It's amazing how much of an impact exercise can have on your mental health and overall well-being. Keep up the good work and I'm sure you'll continue to see improvements in all areas!"

TITLE: [23/f] I think my [22/f] friend needs therapy, but I'm not sure if it's my place to tell her.

POST: We will call her Rita. Rita and I have been friends for almost 5 years. During the beginning of our friendship she had told me that she was recovering from depression but it had gotten a lot better. Throughout our friendship there are a few things I have noticed about her. 

1.	She is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.

2.	 I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)
In regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.

He just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)

3.	I found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.

I haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself. Well last night she called me to see if I wanted to get some coffee with her. I agreed but I'm not sure If it's my place to bring up that I think she needs professional help, or if recommending it would be a good idea.

TL;DR: I think my friend Rita needs therapy, but I'm not sure if it's my place to tell her.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not your place to tell her she needs therapy. You're not a professional, and even if you were, it's not your responsibility to fix her problems. What you can do is be a supportive friend and listen to her when she needs someone to talk to. If she's willing to open up to you, that's great. But don't try to 'fix' her or tell her what she needs. Just be there for her."
2. **FellowHuman**: "I think you're being a great friend by noticing these things and being concerned. It's okay to express your concerns to her, but do it in a non-judgmental way. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed you seem really upset/stressed lately. Is everything okay? Is there anything I can do to support you?' Don't try to tell her what she needs, but offer to be there for her."
3. **RelationshipExpert**: "I'm a therapist, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for friends to notice changes in their friends' behavior and relationships. It's great that you're concerned about Rita's well-being. However, it's not your place to tell her she needs therapy. What you can do is encourage her to seek help if she's willing. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed you seem really unhappy lately. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you work through some of the issues you're facing.' Just be sure to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding."
4. **ConcernedFriend**: "I'm in a similar situation with a friend who's going through a tough time. I've been trying to be supportive, but it's hard when you feel like you're not making a difference. Just remember that you can't fix Rita's problems, but you can be there for her as a friend. Keep being a good listener and offering support when she needs it. And if she's willing to open up to you, that's great. But don't try to 'fix' her or tell her what she needs. Just be there for her."
5. **Rita'sFriend**: "I'm Rita's friend, and I can tell you that she's been going through a tough time lately. She's been struggling with her relationship and her self-esteem. I think it's great that you're concerned about her, but I don't think it's your place to tell her she needs therapy. What you can do is be a supportive friend and listen to her when she needs someone to talk to. If she's willing to open up to you, that's great. But don't try to 'fix' her or tell her what she needs. Just be there for her."

TITLE: Charge-off, Paid in full on my credit report; can I get this removed?

POST: Hi all,

Just under a year ago, I moved states, and brought my credit union account to zero with the intention of closing it. However, before I was able to follow through, Paypal used the bank account to withdraw funds from Christmas shopping. This was maddening because it was my secondary account and not my primary. Anyway, I didn't discover this for months, since my credit union allowed my account to remain overdrafted to the tune of $450, and I wasn't checking that balance anymore. So now it's listed on my credit report and I'm trying to buy a new car, so it would come in very handy if it were removed. Please help!

TL;DR: Charge-off on credit report due to overdraft, paid in full, can I get it removed?

---

RESPONSES:

1. **u/financialfreedom**: Hi! It's great that you've paid off the debt in full. Unfortunately, the charge-off will likely remain on your credit report for 7 years from the original delinquency date. However, since it's paid in full, you can dispute the charge-off with the credit reporting agency and ask them to remove it. You can also consider sending a goodwill deletion request to the credit union. Make sure to keep a record of your communication and follow up with a letter to ensure it's removed.

2. **u/credit_karma**: I'd recommend disputing the charge-off with the credit reporting agency and also sending a letter to the credit union requesting they remove it. You can also try contacting the credit reporting agency and asking them to verify the information with the credit union. If they can't verify it, they may remove it. Keep in mind that the charge-off will still show up on your report for 7 years, but it's worth trying to get it removed.

3. **u/budgeting_boss**: I'd suggest sending a formal dispute letter to the credit reporting agency and also to the credit union. Make sure to include your account number, the date of the charge-off, and the amount paid. You can also include a letter explaining the situation and how it was an error on the part of the credit union. Keep a record of your communication and follow up with a phone call to ensure it's removed.

4. **u/credit_savvy**: I'd recommend disputing the charge-off with the credit reporting agency and also sending a letter to the credit union. You can also try contacting the credit reporting agency and asking them to verify the information with the credit union. If they can't verify it, they may remove it. Keep in mind that the charge-off will still show up on your report for 7 years, but it's worth trying to get it removed. Also, consider keeping a close eye on your credit report and disputing any other errors you find.

This post and responses demonstrate the importance of understanding credit reporting and the steps to take when trying to remove errors from your credit report. The OP is seeking to remove a charge-off from their credit report, which is a common issue for many people.

TITLE: TIFU by starting an oil fire in my kitchen

POST: This fuck up happened a couple years ago before I knew of reddit and now I feel compelled to share it. 

So it was new years eve and my husband and I didn't have much food in the house. So I decided to make some homemade potato chips to munch on while we watched a movie. I used a pot and heated up some oil. The chips turned out okay I can never seem to cut them thin enough. I turned off the stove and returned to the couch to watch our movie. 

So the kitchen in my apartment was hiding behind a corner, so there was no way we could have noticed the flames any sooner. 

I see a ominous orange glow coming from the kitchen so I casually walk over and turn the corner and...
OH SHIT! FIRE! FIRE!

I literally panic like an idiot. And thank goodness my husband was there to take care of the situation otherwise I would have surely burnt down the apartment. Turns out I hadn't turned off the burner, but had left it on the highest setting.

So my husband bolts into the kitchen and grabs the  pot of oil that has ignited. With some quick thinking he grabs a nearby pan and attempts to smother the flames whilst running out of the kitchen towards the door. I open the door and finally in the breezeway of the apartment complex my husband tames the fire.

There was black soot coated on the vent hood of the stove and my pan was destroyed. I am just glad I didn't start the new year by burning down the apartment.

TL;DR: I started an oil fire in my kitchen while making homemade potato chips. Luckily my husband was there to put it out before it spread.

TITLE: What can i do about an abusive owner?(I work in a restaurant with illegal employees)

POST: Like any other restaurant there is a lot of crazy shit that goes on semi-regularly. The owner is an italian immigrant, who has little respect for his employees. Last year he got arrested for beating up one of our 17 yo bussers. He will pretty much do anything he can get away with. All of our kitchen and now bussers are illegal immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador. These dudes are the hardest working chillest bros out there. Favorite people in the restaurant by far. I've even learned semi-fluent spanish from them. My biggest deterrent to reporting my boss for an array of abusive actions, is my concern all my buddies will get deported or something. The servers tip out the bussers every night yet the bussers never see this money. When i confronted the manager she informed me it was used to pay their hourly wage. Our carry-out guy gets tips from time to time directly from the customer. I learned today that he has to give those tips to the owner and the credit card tips are just ignored by him. They tried to tell me the same thing when i covered for the carry out guy this morning. I confronted them then, and was told i could talk about it later when the carry out guy wasn't around. I dont know what to do. Can i report the management or owner with out my foreign buddies getting in trouble.

TL;DR: I work at a restaurant with illegal immigrant employees. The owner is abusive and takes tips from the bussers and carry-out guy. I'm worried about reporting him because I don't want my friends to get deported. What can I do?

---

This post is a great example of the complexities and challenges that can arise when dealing with workplace issues, particularly when it involves illegal immigration and abusive management. The OP is torn between their desire to report the abusive behavior and their concern for the well-being of their friends, who are also illegal immigrants.

The post highlights the power imbalance between the owner and the employees, as well as the fear and vulnerability that comes with being an undocumented immigrant. The OP is aware of the owner's abusive behavior, but is hesitant to report it due to the potential consequences for their friends.

The post also raises questions about the ethics of tipping and how it is distributed in the restaurant. The OP is concerned that the bussers and carry-out guy are not receiving the tips they deserve, and that the owner is taking advantage of their situation.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities and challenges that can arise in the workplace, particularly when it involves issues of power, abuse, and immigration. It highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of reporting abusive behavior, as well as the need to advocate for fair treatment and compensation for all employees.

TITLE: Living with Negativity....26M

POST: Alright so here is the quick and dirty
Me - 26 M
Her - 32 F
Married 2 years this July.
Together 5 years this October.

When we first moved in together I had alot of things that I had to work on as far as being a better husband and communicating with her better, doing my part around the house etc.  Each time it was brought up it devolved into fighting but we figured that this wasn't working so devised a solution, a list!

This worked, my behaviours changed for the betterment of the relationship and myself and I feel like a better person for it.

Now me, I am a generally positive individual, I try my best to maintain a relatively positive outlook on things and just be humorous.  When it comes to serious stuff I am serious but otherwise I love to smile!

The issue I am having now is that we have been having ongoing discussions for the past 6 or so months about her attitude which has been getting progressively worse.  She is employed, currently paying down her student loans and stuck with a job that she hates while she does so.  Understandably not the best situation but I am always here for her and to support her, I've helped her get her food blog started, helped her get the implements for her baking etc.  

Instead of a happier more positive wife I have someone who constantly looks at the negatives, refuses to discuss our future together because it is depressing and just in general has issues showing emotion.

We have discussed this time and again, I'm getting sick of it, she is too and I'm just not seeing much improvement.

I love her, I care for her but for my own mental health I am having difficulty wanting to actually spend time with her when it feels like she just hates life.

Kind of a can't see the forest through the trees kind of thing.

I'm open to any suggestions Reddit may have on this.

TL;DR: Married 2 years, together 5. Wife's negativity is affecting our relationship. We've discussed it multiple times, but I'm not seeing much improvement. I'm feeling drained and unhappy. Any suggestions on how to deal with this?

TITLE: TIFU by getting beat up by a girl

POST: This JUST happened. So I was at a party and I got pretty drunk. Couldn't drive home so I walked to one of my bestriends place that wasnt too far. Ive came unannounced before and spent the night numerous times before, I know where she hides her spare key. So its like 2am and homegirl fell asleep watching tv the couch(where I usually crash when I come over.) So I crash on her bed. Heres where the FU happens. She woke up middle of the night to get water and moved to her bed without noticing me. Both of us are asleep in the same bed and I spooned her. She then freaks out and grabs a lamp and attacks me with it. She got on top of me and threw a few more swings, I was yelling "STOP STOP STOP" but she kept on going at me. She then realizes it was me and stops. She patched me up, we had some cocoa, laughed about the whole situation and she went on to fix the bed before going back to sleep. Now here I am buzzed telling the people of reddit how I got beat up by a girl. Happy holidays everyone!

TL;DR: Got drunk, crashed at friend's place, spooned her in bed, got attacked with a lamp, got beat up, and now I'm telling the world about it.

TITLE: Our kitty is so picky, we've given in.

POST: Our rescue cat, Abby, has always been picky with food. When we first got her, she was quite ill and didn't like to eat anyway so that was even more difficult. Every time we think she likes a food, she stops eating it within a week and won't eat it again (Only after we have bought a months supply...).  

The thing is, we've tried to out-stubborn the cat, and it was a game of chicken we were never going to win.  And then came kitty number two, Ollie, who is just the jabba the hutt of kitties.

Not only will Ollie eat any left over food in Abby's bowl, but Abby doesn't want it and actively gives it to her baby sister.  It got so bad that Abby was vomiting clear bile out of hunger at night... we tried separating them, getting new foods, giving dry food to snack on... it was no use, she didn't eat. Before anyone asks, she HAS been to the vet and they just said she's picky.

Fast forward to us getting a gift pack from our vet for the baby when we took Abby in to see if there is a problem. It has royal canin weaning kitty food, and we thought we'd see if Ollie liked it. Guess who likes it? Abby. It is kitty crack cocaine I don't know. We started sprinkling it on top of normal cat food, and guess what.. she eats it. It's like a seasoning.

So here is our doubt, is this ok to do? The vet seemed really passive about it, and I don't know how good this is to do. I looked up its ingredients and it almost seems just like a vitamin packed dry food. We are sprinkling so she doesn't eat more than a a few grams.

TL;DR: Our picky cat won't eat normal food, but loves a royal canin weaning kitty food. We're sprinkling it on top of her normal food and she eats it. Is this ok to do?

COMMENTS:

* "I'm no expert, but it seems like the vet is okay with it, and it's not like you're giving her a whole bowl of it. As long as she's eating and not having any adverse reactions, I'd say it's a win-win. Maybe try to gradually phase out the royal canin and see if she'll eat the regular food again?"
* "I've had similar issues with my cat, and I ended up switching to a high-quality grain-free food. It might be worth trying a different brand or type of food to see if that makes a difference. But if this is working for you and the vet is okay with it, I wouldn't worry too much about it."
* "I'm a vet tech, and I've seen this happen before. Sometimes cats just need a little boost to get them eating again. As long as you're not overdoing it and making sure she's getting a balanced diet, I think it's okay to use the royal canin as a supplement. Just keep an eye on her and make sure she's not developing any allergies or sensitivities."
* "I've been in your shoes before, and it's frustrating when you feel like you're at the mercy of your cat's pickiness. But it sounds like you're doing what's best for Abby, and that's all that matters. Keep an eye on her and make sure she's healthy and happy, and I'm sure she'll be just fine."

TITLE: Had a great date with a guy [26M] that I [23F] met online, and then out of the blue he goes completely no contact two days later. Do I reach out for closure?

POST: I have been texting and snapchatting a guy I met on OKCupid for 2 weeks before we decided to meet and go on our first date. 

When we met, we clicked. Our sense of humor aligned, we both have the same views on religion and politics, and never ran out of things to talk about over the course of the day. (We went hiking and picnicking, so we were together for about 7 hours on a Saturday.) At the end of the night, there was a perfect first kiss, then some making out later, and talks of a "next time."

We texted back and forth a little on Sunday, and then Monday I get radio silence. He finally texts me back these one word answers, and then eventually just stops responding. I check on Facebook to see if there's anything going on (as he's a fairly active user and uses Facebook a little like Twitter) only to find out I've been unfriended. 

That was two days ago, and I'm afraid I've been a mess ever since (I know it's silly to get attached that quickly, but we had in depth conversations over the course of two weeks and I've always worn my heart on my sleeve anyway.) I know it's over, I just have no idea why. He gave me no indication that anything was wrong, and if going on that date with me was just acting then he deserves an Oscar. 

Do I reach out to him again for closure? I don't want to be the clingy girl that can't take a hint, but I'm kind of heartbroken that I don't at least know WHY.

TL;DR: Had a great date with a guy I met online, and then he went no contact two days later. Should I reach out for closure?

---

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, I think you should just let it go. If he's not interested in talking to you, it's likely because he's not interested in you at all. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to give you a simple 'it's not you, it's me' or a 'thanks but no thanks'. You're better off moving on and finding someone who actually cares about you."
* "I would reach out to him, but only once. If he doesn't respond or gives you a lame excuse, then it's clear he's not interested and you should move on. You've already given him two weeks of your time, and it's not like you're asking for a commitment or anything. Just a simple 'hey, what's going on?' to get some closure."
* "I think you should take a step back and focus on yourself right now. It's okay to be heartbroken, but don't waste your time trying to get closure from someone who doesn't care. You're better off finding someone who actually wants to be with you and make you happy. Remember, you're worthy of love and respect, and don't settle for anything less."
* "I would suggest taking a break from online dating for a bit. It can be tough to deal with the rejection and uncertainty, and it's okay to take some time for yourself. When you're ready to get back out there, you can try again and see what happens. Just remember to prioritize your own feelings and well-being, and don't settle for anything less than what you deserve."
* "I think you should reach out to him, but only if you're prepared for the possibility that he might not respond or give you a lame excuse. If he does respond, try to keep the conversation light and casual, and don't get too hung up on getting closure. Remember, you're not owed an explanation, and it's okay to move on and find someone who actually cares about you."

TITLE: My [37M] ex-wife [36F] started dating someone that doesn't want her seeing me. To respect his wishes, she has cut off contact and I can't see my stepson [15M] that I've known for nine years.

POST: My ex-wife and I have known each other for nine years. For those nine years I have also had the wonderful opportunity of building a father/son relationship with my stepson.  My son's mother was/is the best friend I've ever had. Sometimes relationships have their issues so we divorced. We have stayed friends and have been able to be a part of their lives. 

Around the end of June and beginning of July she started to date someone seriously.  All I wanted for her was to be happy, which she was. At the end of July she told me she needed to speak with me. We met for lunch and the first words out of her mouth were, "You're going to hate me." At that point she told me her new boyfriend didn't want her seeing me, but that it was her choice. She then told me I wouldn't be able to see my son, who I would see at least once a week to hang out, work on homework, or use the season tickets we had to one of the local sports teams.  Afterwards, she told me she would re-evaluate the situation in four months and that I would be able to see my stepson one more time to speak with him (under the supervision of his aunt). After the meeting she blocked me on all social media and had my son do the same.

I was devastated because I had lost two of my best friends. 
The last 16 weeks have been some of the most difficult I've ever faced. I contacted my son's aunt and she told me her sister hadn't told her anything about the agreement of seeing my son and that she didn't want to get involved. I'm fine with that, I don't want to cause any rifts with her family. 

This Monday will be the end of four months. I have some ideas on how I should approach the situation but I would like anyone's opinion on how to proceed.

TL;DR: My ex-wife cut off contact with me after her new boyfriend didn't want her seeing me. I haven't seen my stepson in 16 weeks and I'm not sure how to approach the situation when the four-month mark is up.

TITLE: My [22f] girlfriend pays her little sisters 100$ phone bill every month when we can barely pay our own bills. She refuses to bring it up to her parents.

POST: I'm 22m and my girlfriend 22f have an apartment together. We have a rent, phone bills etc. Both of us work full time to pay our bills. The problem is my girlfriend has been paying her little sisters bill as well as her own and we never have any extra money. We can't go to a dinner or movie at the end of the month because we have bills and food. Her parents are not the best off but they make at least 5 times as much as we do. They have pot (which I have no problem with ) and do other recreational activities. Her little sister is 13. 

I understand a cellphone is necessary with buses and stuff but why is my gf fronting the bill. She refused to bring it up to either of them and I've talked to other people in her family and their on my side.  I keep telling her to please bring it up to them. I didn't mind before we had all these bills but now that we're trying to start a life every penny counts.  I don't want to bring it up to her parents because I'm not exactly in the position too but this is effecting our bills. Not to mention I want her to be on my significantly cheaper service provider. 

Her mom also does little things like say she's coming over then shows up her, her boyfriend, his son and his sons friend. We have a tiny one bedroom and this ruined my night because I couldn't even sit on my couch and relax after work. She's also told her little sister Her and her friends could stay at our house while they attended a con which we could not house or feed. (They didn't enzd up staying but it's the principal) My girlfriends sister is family but I don't think it's her/our responsibility to care for her. The main issue though is the phone bill. What should I do guys?

TL;DR: My girlfriend pays her 13-year-old sister's phone bill every month, which is 100$ and we can barely afford our own bills. She refuses to bring it up to her parents and I'm getting frustrated. I think it's unfair and it's affecting our financial stability.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like your girlfriend's family is taking advantage of her. It's not fair that she's shouldering the responsibility of her sister's phone bill, especially when they're not struggling financially themselves. You should have a calm and respectful conversation with your girlfriend about how this is affecting your relationship and your financial stability. Maybe she's not aware of the impact it's having on you, and a conversation could help her see things from your perspective."
* "I think you're being a bit unfair. Your girlfriend's sister is still a minor, and it's not uncommon for parents to ask their older children to help out with their younger siblings' expenses. It's possible that her parents are relying on her to help out because they're not able to manage their finances themselves. Maybe you could try having a conversation with her parents about how this is affecting your relationship and see if you can come to a compromise."
* "I agree with the OP. It's not fair that the girlfriend is shouldering the responsibility of her sister's phone bill. It's not like the sister is contributing to the household income or helping out in any way. The girlfriend's parents should be taking care of their own child's expenses, not relying on their adult daughter to do it for them. I think the girlfriend should have a conversation with her parents about how this is affecting her and her partner's financial stability."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the phone bill. Maybe your girlfriend is just trying to help out her family and you're not seeing the bigger picture. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling and why you think this is unfair? Maybe there's more to the story than you're aware of."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about how this is affecting your relationship and your financial stability. Maybe she's not aware of the impact it's having on you, and a conversation could help her see things from your perspective. It's also possible that she's not aware of the financial struggles you're facing, and a conversation could help her understand where you're coming from."

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my Roommate [24 M] 5 months, We agreed to a certain amount for rent. I ask for rent early and he says "i'm not an atm". Need some advice.

POST: A little bit of back story. I am in a situation where I do not have to pay rent or utilities for my house.

 I decided to let my friend move in with me as long as he pays 150 dollars a month to me for rent. Today I just asked him if I could get the money early because I need gas and to get some other stuff. He basically told me that I use him as an atm. I don't understand this. We agree'd to a certain amount. I told him that I hope he didn't see it that way, because I don't see him that way at all. He has lended me 15 bucks for a leash for my dog a while back and I told him he could take it off of rent, but that's the only time I have asked for any sort of early rent from him or any sort of money beyond the agree'd 150. What's the deal and what can I say? I'm kind of upset about it and it felt like an accusation of sorts.

TL;DR: Roommate says I'm using him as an ATM when I ask for rent early. We agreed on 150/month, and I've only asked for early rent once before (for a leash).

TITLE: Get paid in cash/silver+gold bullion, not sure how to file taxes.

POST: So I'll be filing my won taxes for the first time, and I'm a little confused because of the way I make money. I work online and get paid with either btc or paypal. When I get paid with bitcoin, I sell in on localbitcoins for either cash or gold/silver bullion. I've had some issues with paypal before, and because of this I don't add all my personal/banking info. Each week I use the money on paypal to purchase around $3500 of gold/silver bullion from ebay. All of which I keep in a safe. I have money in my checking/savings account that I use for bills/expenses, so all the money I have made this year is in gold/silver. I know this seems really silly or might be a stupid thing to do with my money, but collecting gold and silver is a hobby of mine and I've just been stocking up. 
I started keeping detailed track of the exact dollar amount I was making about 4 months ago, but earlier than that I was stupid and didn't write anything down so I don't know the exact amount of money I made. 
Is there something I should do if I don't know how much I have made, and don't have a W2 or any tax info? Do I mark down that I'm self employed?
I know this seems really confusing, so I understand if your advice is just "hire a tax professional"

TL;DR: I make money online, get paid in bitcoin/paypal, sell bitcoin for cash/gold/silver, and keep all my money in gold/silver. I don't have a W2 or tax info, and I'm not sure how to file my taxes. Help!

---

**Comments:**

* "You're going to need to consult a tax professional, this is definitely not a DIY situation. They'll be able to help you figure out how to report your income and deductions."
* "I'm no expert, but it seems like you're self-employed and should report your income as such. You'll need to keep track of your expenses and deductions, including the cost of buying and storing the gold/silver. You may also need to file a Schedule C and pay self-employment tax."
* "I think you're overcomplicating things. You're essentially just a collector of precious metals. You can report your income as miscellaneous income and claim the value of the gold/silver as a deduction. Just make sure you keep accurate records and consult with a tax pro if you're unsure."
* "You're going to need to get a tax professional to help you with this. It's not just a matter of reporting your income, you also need to consider the tax implications of holding gold and silver as an investment. You may be able to deduct the cost of buying and storing the metals, but you'll also need to consider the potential capital gains tax implications if you sell any of the metals in the future."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic about this. You're not doing anything illegal or unethical. You're just a collector of precious metals. You can report your income as miscellaneous income and claim the value of the gold/silver as a deduction. Just make sure you keep accurate records and consult with a tax pro if you're unsure."



**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is self-employed and should report their income as such.
* They will need to keep track of their expenses and deductions, including the cost of buying and storing the gold/silver.
* They may need to file a Schedule C and pay self-employment tax.
* It's recommended to consult a tax professional to ensure accurate and compliant tax filing.
* The OP should keep accurate records of their income and expenses to make it easier to file their taxes.
* The tax implications of holding gold and silver as an investment should be considered, including potential capital gains tax implications if the metals are sold in the future.

TITLE: I am a fucking dumbass who can't read numbers

POST: I mixed up two of the digits when I sent the text message.

I am in a student organization that helps build primary and secondary schools in rural areas in Honduras. I went on a week long service trip last winter and it was the most amazing week of my life. I can't describe why, but being in this organization and working towards my fundraising goal has been just about the most important and fulfilling thing in my life over the last year or so.

I was supposed to head back to Honduras in 5 days. For now I am home from college over winter break. I noticed last week that I made the colossal mistake of leaving my passport at my college apartment (~5 hrs away). Thankfully, I had a roommate still there who could mail it to me. With over 10 business days before leaving on my trip at the time, I figured mailing it was not much of a risk (I realize now how stupid this reasoning is).

Of course, today, I checked back over my text conversation with my roommate and noticed I got the fucking address wrong. 2 numbers swapped places. I don't know if I read it wrong or typed it in wrong. The address I sent does not exist. I am a fucking aerospace engineering student but I can't fucking read a fucking 5 digit number apparently. 

I am lost for options at this point. It will be near impossible to track it down (it's in an envelope, no tracking #). It will most certainly be returned to my college apartment too late to get in time for my flight.

I realize that this only happened because of a special series of idiotic errors that only I am capable of. I have wasted a years worth of fundraising, over a thousand dollars worth. I spent so many mornings at bake sales and sponsored events. I worked so hard and now I will spend the week at home feeling sorry for myself. I want to crawl under a rock and die.

TL;DR: I'm a dumbass who can't read numbers and I just lost my passport and my chance to go back to Honduras.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, it's not the end of the world. You can always reapply for a passport and try to get back on the trip next year."
* "I feel you, I once accidentally sent a package to the wrong address and it took weeks to get it back. You're not alone in this struggle"
* "You're not a dumbass for making a mistake. We all make mistakes. It's how you learn from them that matters. You can always try to get back on the trip next year or find another way to make a difference."
* "I'm an aerospace engineering student too and I can attest that even we can make mistakes. It's not about being able to read numbers, it's about being able to learn from them. You'll get another chance to go to Honduras, and who knows, maybe this is an opportunity to learn something new and come back even stronger."
* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you were really looking forward to going back to Honduras. But like others have said, it's not the end of the world. You can always try to get back on the trip next year or find another way to make a difference. And hey, at least you have a good story to tell now"

**Mood:** The post is written in a frustrated and embarrassed tone, with the author expressing their disappointment and regret over the situation. The comments are supportive and encouraging, with many people sharing their own experiences of making similar mistakes and offering words of wisdom and advice. The overall mood is one of commiseration and understanding.

TITLE: How do I [21F] break up with my BF [21M] of two years? First relationship.

POST: It's over. 

It hurts to admit it, but it's true. We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. 

There's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). 

It's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. 

What do I say? I don't want to hurt him. I've been putting this off because I don't want to have to go through the stress of one of us moving out or explaining to his parents (who treat me like a daughter). How do I even bring it up? I have never done this before and I don't know how. 

Also- my biggest fear- will I regret it? 

Thank you for any advice or comforting words.

TL;DR: 21F, been with BF (21M) for 2 years, feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, and controlled. Want to break up, but scared of hurting him and the unknown. Need advice on how to approach the conversation and if I'll regret it.

TITLE: I (24) have found out my bf's (25) mother abandoned their family. How do I be supportive?

POST: I am in a new relationship (4 months) and discovered through my boyfriend's friend that his mother abandoned their family when he was very young. One of his friends let this slip to me after a few drinks at a party. My boyfriend has not told me yet.

Previously I knew there has been no contact with his mom and the subject is very touchy. I haven't pushed him to reveal anything. We had spoken about our pasts before, he was upset but said in time he will be able to tell me things and I am ok waiting for him to share. 

He's also been hurt in former relationships and I think this has really affected him being open with me as he avoids in-depth or emotional conversations.

I come from a family where my parents are still together and have no idea how to approach this or help him feel more at ease with me. I care about him very much and want to make this work. Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR: I found out my boyfriend's mom abandoned him when he was young. He hasn't told me yet and I'm unsure how to approach this or be supportive. Help!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think it's great that you're considering his feelings and wanting to be supportive. It's understandable that he hasn't told you yet, and it's not your job to push him to reveal more than he's comfortable sharing. Just be patient, listen to him when he's ready to talk, and validate his emotions. You can also ask him how he feels about you knowing this information and if there's anything you can do to make him feel more comfortable."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's amazing that you're willing to learn and grow with him. It's not easy to deal with family trauma, and it's great that you're acknowledging his pain. You can start by asking him how he feels about his mom's abandonment and if there's anything he's been wanting to talk about but hasn't had the chance. Also, be patient and don't pressure him to open up if he's not ready. Just being present and supportive can go a long way."
3. **u/anonymous12345**: "I think it's great that you're considering his feelings and wanting to be supportive.

TITLE: I need some advice about a few things

POST: The whole starting point of everything happened when my dad walked out on my mum after cheating. It's been an extremely messy and complicated divorce that is still not settled 4 years later. My dad has depression and has some perceived victim complex when talking about the divorce to people - to some he will lie and act as if they are still together (he didn't even tell his own family, they found out by trying to contact him through us). To others he says how my mum is the one who cheated - but HE is the one who cheated. He has also been keeping secrets and lying for many years before he left. He has lied constantly throughout the court process and won't agree to settle anything because he wants to destroy my mum - even the mediator says his behaviour is absolutely fucked and can't understand why he won't just settle things. That is only some of it - but I don't speak to him at all anymore. He hasn't supported me one bit throughout this entire process or even tried to.

A knock on effect is that now my mum and sibling have depression as well. All 3 of my immediate family have depression and I do not.  It is very difficult to live with her sometimes and I don't know what to do.

Due to all of this my mum is now trying to support me and the pets we have (sibling moved out of home)singlehandedly but money is extremely  tight all of the time. Due to me being over 18, my dad is not legally required to help me at all... It creates a lot of stress and I did have a job but lost it due to no hours for me. Now I have zero income. I am trying to get through uni - 4/5 days a week 1h30mins away, and do 5:30 starts most mornings leaving me somewhat sleep deprived. Moving is out of the question due to combined home circumstances, but the fuel cost is really difficult. I have only got the work experience of the job I just lost - 3 months weekend casual worker.

TL;DR: Dad cheated, left, and won't settle the divorce. Mum and sibling have depression, I don't. I'm struggling to live with mum, and we're struggling financially. I'm trying to get through uni, but it's tough with no income and high fuel costs.

TITLE: Me [15 F] with my ex-bf [15 M] 2 months, having trouble letting go after getting dumped

POST: Basically I was dating another guy (John) for a year- not bad for a first relationship- but he broke up with me in a pretty harsh way (just dumped me out of the blue on the first day back to school. I was a wreck for months). Then my new ex (Mike) comes along, and kinda lifts me back out from my depression-esque mentality. So we're both attracted to each other, but I was scared to date Mike because I didn't think I could go through anotehr breakup. But after a while, I finally relented cuz I couldn't bear to see him with other people, and he kinda said, "If we break up, I'll make you hate me or something so it'll hurt less." Either way, we got together, but I was a bit clingy and needed a lot of his time, so he said he couldn't deal with it. Broke up with me gently, and said we could stay friends (we were pretty good friends in that period where he was helping me get over John). Now I want to be friends again, but I feel like I'm trying too hard. Also I still like him, and it's only been... about exactly a week. I've actually just started no contact for about 3 hours (shoulda done it right away I know, but it was hard), but I already feel like shit. 

Any advice? I need to let go and stop making a fool out of myself, especially because we have so many classes together. I can't keep my eyes off him and everyone says it's creepy. Help!

TL;DR: Got dumped by my first boyfriend, then dated my ex-friend Mike, but he broke up with me after 2 months cuz I was clingy. Now I want to be friends, but I'm trying too hard and still have feelings for him. Need help letting go and not making a fool out of myself in class.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're still in love with Mike and that's okay. It's normal to take time to process your feelings after a breakup. But you need to prioritize your own healing and well-being. Take some time to focus on yourself, do things that make you happy, and try to distract yourself from thoughts of Mike. It's okay to still have feelings for him, but you can't keep pursuing him if he's not interested. You deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are."
2. **u/sadpanda88**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to still have feelings for someone after a breakup, especially if it was a recent one. But you need to remember that Mike made it clear he wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship with you anymore. It's okay to still care about him, but you can't keep trying to make him love you back. You need to focus on moving on and finding someone who is right for you."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're trying too hard to hold onto the friendship because you're still in love with Mike. It's okay to acknowledge your feelings, but you need to prioritize your own healing and well-being. Take some time to focus on yourself and do things that make you happy. You can always try to reconnect with Mike in the future if you're both on the same page, but for now, focus on moving forward and finding someone who is right for you."

TITLE: I know my girlfriend [18/F] of 9 months cares, but she just doesn't put in any effort and I [20/M] am sick of it...worth breaking up over?

POST: Been seeing this girl since November, she is so much fun, absolutely gorgeous and very well-intentioned...but I think she's just fucking lazy. I'll ask her out and get turned down because her parents won't let her, she has work, she has uni or she's with other friends, to the point where I've stopped trying.

Part of the issue is me, because I'm too spiteful and refuse to be the one always asking. I asked two friends out to lunch today and just didn't bother asking my own girlfriend, simply because there was like an 80% chance she'd say no for whatever reason and I'd get pissed off.

I tried to break up with her a few months ago for the same reason, really, and I've had words with her about it since too. I know she cares, I know that I mean a lot to her and she doesn't want to lose me...but she just doesn't show it at all [when she's not with me]. When we're together everything is really good, great even. We have heaps of fun and clearly love each other's company. But once we part ways, it might be for the whole week despite us living like a 20 minute drive away, and 90% of the time we'll only see each other if I keep asking.

I've had this issue for a while but have told myself I'll wait until the end of August since by then we'll have had a few weeks with her parents out of the picture to see if the relationship actually changes, but I don't know if I can even hang in that much longer. I asked her to come over on Thursday since I hadn't seen her for a week and had been away - she was going to be at work that night and my place is closer than hers from there - but no, she was "too tired" to stay with me.

Since I've brought it up before and nothing's really changed, should I even go through the same speech again? I want to love this girl but I just spend so much of my time being pissed off.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 9 months is lazy, doesn't put in effort, and I'm sick of it. We have great times together, but when we're apart, she doesn't make an effort to see me. I've tried talking to her about it before, but nothing's changed. Should I break up with her again?

---

This post is a classic example of a relationship conundrum. The OP (original poster) is frustrated with his girlfriend's lack of effort in the relationship, despite her caring and loving nature. He's tried talking to her about it before, but nothing has changed, and he's considering breaking up with her again.

The post highlights the importance of communication and effort in a relationship. The OP feels like his girlfriend is not making an effort to see him or spend time with him, and this is causing him to feel frustrated and unloved. He's tried to address this issue with her before, but it seems like she's not willing to change her behavior.

The post also touches on the theme of compromise and understanding in a relationship. The OP is willing to work on the relationship and make sacrifices, but he feels like his girlfriend is not meeting him halfway. He's considering breaking up with her again because he feels like he's not getting the effort and attention he needs from her.

The post has received a lot of comments and advice from other Redditors, with some people suggesting that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and needs, while others are advising him to re-evaluate whether the relationship is truly worth his time and energy.

Overall, this post is a great example of the challenges and complexities of relationships, and the importance of communication, effort, and compromise in making a relationship work.

TITLE: I [27F] am upset with something the man I'm dating [30M] texted. Am I overreacting?

POST: I [27F] have been seeing a new guy, John [30M] for a month and a half. We see each other once a week, often on weekends, and text each other every day after work, usually telling the other one what our day has been like. He is the one initiating the conversation most of the time; not sure if it's relevant, but just saying in case it is. We didn't have the exclusivity talk yet.

Yesterday he initiated the conversation again and started telling me about this woman at work who wanted to set him him up with someone. I asked him if she showed him pictures of the woman in question. He replied: "Yes, she looks terrible. **I lied** and said I just started seeing someone."

I am very upset because of the "I lied" part of the sentence but didn't tell him anything about it yet. He didn't seem to be joking at all.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that our first date was outside and awesome and lasted six hours but that the dates after were mostly dinner at his place.

Do you believe he is seeing me as a fuck buddy and thinks I'm cool with it, or is there any chance that he is testing the waters to see how I am going to be reacting to his behavior?

TL;DR: My boyfriend told me he lied to a woman at work about being in a relationship, and I'm upset. Am I overreacting?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "You're not overreacting. That's a huge red flag. If he's willing to lie to someone at work about being in a relationship, he might be willing to lie to you too. Have a conversation with him about how you feel and see how he reacts. If he's not willing to own up to his actions and apologize, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "I agree with throwaway123456. Lying is a major issue in any relationship. It's not just about the fact that he lied, but also that he didn't seem to be joking about it. That suggests to me that he's not taking your feelings or the relationship seriously. Have a calm and honest conversation with him about how his actions made you feel. If he's not willing to listen and work through this issue, it might be time to consider moving on."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're right to be upset, but I also think you need to consider the context. You didn't have the exclusivity talk yet, so it's possible that he was just trying to test the waters or see how you'd react. However, the fact that he lied to someone at work is still a major issue. I would suggest having a conversation with him about how you feel and seeing how he reacts. If he's willing to own up to his actions and apologize, it might be worth continuing the relationship. But if he's not willing to listen or take responsibility, it's probably best to move on."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you're overreacting a bit. It's just one little white lie, right? I mean, it's not like he's lying to you about something important. And you didn't even have the exclusivity talk yet, so it's not like he's committed to anything. Just chill out and have a conversation with him about it. I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
5. **RealTalkRachel**: "Girl, you're not overreacting at all. That's a huge deal. If he's willing to lie to someone at work about being in a relationship, he's probably willing to lie to you too. And the fact that he didn't seem to be joking about it is even worse. You deserve better than someone who's willing to lie to you. Have a conversation with him and see how he reacts. If he's not willing to own up to his actions and apologize, it's time to move on."

TITLE: I (19F) just got stood up by the guy (19M) I've been seeing for 5 weeks.

POST: So I just got stood up. 

Here's the deal. I've been seeing this guy for about 5 weeks now and we've really been hitting it off. So far everything has been really good, no problems, and we planned last night to meet up for lunch during my 12-1 break today. We texted and had unrelated conversation this morning, then at 12 I left class to go meet him. 

By 12:15 he's a no-show, so I text to make sure everything is ok. 

By 12:30 I'm pretty pissed off, and a friend passes by so I accompany him to lunch and text the guy id been planning to meet that I had to leave to get food since I had class at 1.  He responds about 10 minutes later with something along the lines of "sorry, I'm awful, I got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time". I haven't said anything yet. 

I'm pretty angry, and those who know me in person know that I never get angry about anything. I don't know what to do. I really liked him and things had been going really well. If it wasn't for that I would have no trouble just not responding and never seeing him again, but I do really like him. What do I do/say?

TL;DR: Got stood up by guy I've been seeing for 5 weeks. He says he got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time. I'm angry and unsure what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to show up to a planned meeting. Don't bother responding to him, just block his number and move on."
* "I'd say give him a chance to explain himself, but honestly, it sounds like he's just making excuses. If you're really angry, maybe take a break from him for a bit and reassess the situation."
* "I'd be angry too! You should definitely talk to him about how you feel, but also make it clear that you expect better from him in the future. Maybe set some boundaries or something."
* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not that into you. If he can't even be bothered to show up to a planned meeting, what's he going to do when things get tough in a relationship? You deserve someone who respects your time and feelings."
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate the relationship. If he can't even be bothered to show up to a planned meeting, what's going to happen when things get tough? You deserve someone who is reliable and respectful."
* "I'd say give him the benefit of the doubt, but only if he's willing to make it up to you. If he's just going to make excuses and not take responsibility for his actions, then maybe it's time to move on."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'm going to take a step back and reevaluate the relationship. I really liked him, but if he can't even be bothered to show up to a planned meeting, what's going to happen when things get tough? I deserve someone who respects my time and feelings. I'll probably talk to him about it and see how he responds. Thanks again for the advice!"

TITLE: TIFU by being weirdly obsessed with coin orientation

POST: I was about 10 and my friend and I saw a cool infomercial (no idea now what they were selling) where a guy flattened a penny with a hammer. (If you think you know where this is going, you are absolutely right.) For some reason, we thought it would be a great idea to try that, only we couldn't find a penny, so we decided to try to flatten a dime. Shockingly, dimes and pennies are made of different materials, so we weren't making much progress, but like good little elementary school kids, we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house. When it was my friend's turn, I noticed Roosevelt's face was angled about 40 degrees away from her, and for some reason it seemed really crucial that he be facing her dead on, so I rotated the dime. I was a neurotic, whiny kid, so when my mom heard me crying, she assumed it was something minor and came out rolling her eyes before she saw all the blood. Luckily, I didn't break any bones, but I had a cool hangnail with which to gross out all the boys on the bus for the next few weeks.

TL;DR: I TIFU by being weirdly obsessed with coin orientation and ended up with a hangnail and a cool story.

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author shares a humorous and relatable anecdote about their childhood, where they became fixated on the orientation of a coin and ended up getting hurt. The post is lighthearted and entertaining, with a clear narrative and a dash of self-deprecation. The author's use of humor and exaggeration ("we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house") adds to the post's comedic value.

The subreddit r/tifu is a community where people share their own stories of mistakes, mishaps, and embarrassing moments. The community is known for its humor and camaraderie, and the posts are often relatable and entertaining.

TITLE: Dear reddit: Cute girl at the bank I want to ask out.

POST: The bank I go to has the cutest teller working inside during the afternoons, and I try to make up reasons to go just to see her. The problem is that when three tellers, or whatever, are working, no guarantee I'll get her window. I can't really just tell the person behind me, 'No no, you go ahead, I'm waiting for the cute one.' Anyway, We've talked a few times and flirted mildly. I was super-thrilled to see that she had a copy of an R.A Salvatore book - the fourth in the Drizzt series. So she's really pretty AND into geeky fantasy? I'm there!

So the question is, well two really, How to I find enough excuses to keep going back till I get her window? No guarantee she'll even be working that day anyway. And secondly, I feel kind of creepy hitting on a woman who's working. Like, she can't get away or whatever.

TL;DR: I want to ask out a cute bank teller, but I don't want to be creepy. How do I keep going back to the bank without being too obvious, and how do I ask her out without making her feel uncomfortable?

---

This post is a great example of a common theme in the r/AskReddit community: people seeking advice on how to navigate social situations, particularly those involving romantic or platonic interests. The OP (original poster) is clearly smitten with the bank teller and wants to ask her out, but is worried about coming across as creepy or too obvious.

The post is well-written and provides enough context for readers to understand the situation. The OP is also self-aware and acknowledges the potential issues with their approach, which makes it easier for readers to offer helpful advice.

Some possible responses to this post might include:

* Suggestions for how to increase the chances of getting the teller's window, such as going during off-peak hours or making a point to ask about specific banking services that might require her attention.
* Advice on how to ask the teller out in a way that is respectful and considerate of her feelings, such as suggesting a casual coffee date or asking her about her interests outside of work.
* Encouragement to be genuine and authentic in the approach, rather than trying to be too clever or manipulative.
* Warnings about the potential risks of pursuing a romantic interest in someone who is in a position of authority or power, and the importance of respecting boundaries and consent.

Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of thoughtful and engaging content that can be found on r/AskReddit. It's a relatable and entertaining post that encourages readers to share their own experiences and advice, and it's a great way for the OP to get feedback and guidance on how to navigate a tricky social situation.

TITLE: Why aren't men interested in me? [f/20]

POST: Now, I don't really even know where to begin with this. I'm a 20 year old woman and I believe i'm a great person, but I just can figure out why men aren't interested in me unless they're just trying to hook up. I've had my fair share of hook ups, but never with someone i've just randomly met and i've continued to have good friendships with these men without having any desire to make a relationship out of it.

I am a full time student trying to get my degree, even doing that I have plenty of time to myself for other activities. I also am a mother. Sure I had my child young, but it's the one thing that changed my life for the better. I was not in school pre child and now my life has come together more than I ever could have hoped for. My child's father and I have a great friendship, and that's all it is. We co-parent very well together. Thus also leading me to have lots of time for myself as our time with our child is split 50/50.

I'd like to think that i'm a great person with a great personality. I enjoy pretty much anything and would be willing to experience new things. I've also always been told that i'm a very attractive woman. Now what am I missing here? I definitely don't need a man to make me happy, as I already am. I just know that i'd love to have that person who makes my life a little brighter.

Some of the men that i've been involved with recently (but not too recently) or interested in always seem to find a way out and I can't help but think it's either something to do with the fact that I already have a child or it's just something about me. I have my entire life in order. I live in my own home, no debt, I attend college and am very close to getting my degree. If  I can tell you one thing from that is that I have my life in FAR better order than most people my age and in my situation. Much better than most of my friends too.

So, any advice would help. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for, but it's something.

TL;DR: I'm a 20 year old woman with a child, in school, and have my life together. I'm attractive, have a great personality, and enjoy new experiences. I've had trouble finding men interested in me, and I'm not sure why. I'd love some advice on what I might be missing.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not about you being a single mom or having a child, it's about the fact that you're not putting yourself out there. You're saying you're not looking for a relationship, but you're also saying you want someone to make your life brighter. You need to be open to the idea of dating and relationships. Try online dating, join social clubs or groups that align with your interests, and put yourself out there. You never know who you might meet."
2. **u/skeptical_sam**: "I'm not trying to be harsh, but you're being a bit too focused on your own accomplishments. While it's great that you have your life together, men aren't just looking for someone who has their life together. They're looking for someone who is interesting, fun, and can hold a conversation. You need to work on developing your own interests and hobbies outside of school and parenting. Take up a new hobby, join a book club, or start a new project. This will not only make you more interesting to others, but it will also make you more fulfilled as a person."
3. **u/positive_vibes_only**: "OP, I think you're being too critical of yourself. You're a great person with a lot to offer, and you deserve to be happy. Instead of focusing on what you think is wrong with you, try to focus on what you have to offer. You're a student, a mother, and a person with a lot of potential. You deserve someone who will appreciate you for who you are, and if that person isn't out there yet, then that's okay. Keep being your amazing self and the right person will come along."
4. **u/honest_hank**: "OP, I'm going to be blunt. You're not giving men a reason to be interested in you. You're saying you're not looking for a relationship, but you're also saying you want someone to make your life brighter. That's a contradiction. You need to decide what you want and be clear about it. If you're not looking for a relationship, then don't say you are. If you are looking for a relationship, then start putting yourself out there and being open to the idea of dating. And for the love of God, stop talking about how great you are. It's not attractive."

TITLE: What's the best way to get over being jealous of GF's Gay best friend?

POST: 22M, Girlfriend is 21F. We've been together for a year and a half. Her best friend is gay. At first I was uncomfortable with him since I don't know that many gay people, but the more I hung out with him (only a few times) the more comfortable I've been with him. We have complete trust in each other. Girlfriend actually went out with him when they were in high school together, then he cheated on her and then that's when he came out of the closet. They've remained best friends and like to go to gay clubs together. I feel this problem would be less of an issue if I went with them, but I work really late 5 days a week, (til 3am on weekends).

My only problem with him is how much he likes to drink which I feel like has an influence on her. I've brought that up to her but she says she will only keep drinking when she wants to. When she would instagram pictures of them together hanging at the club or wherever it made me feel uneasy. I felt it was unhealthy to feel that way and getting addicted to seeing what she would post so I stopped going on instagram completely. 

The reason why I get jealous is because I feel like she has more fun when it's just him and her vs me and her since he makes her laugh so much. Does anyone have any advice for learning to accept the idea that it's okay that maybe she does have fun with him more, since he is her best friend and all.. 

Re-reading what I wrote here, makes me feel like this whole thing is silly, but I still would like to hear what others have to say. Thanks.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has gay best friend, I'm jealous of their bond and how much fun they have together. I feel like I'm not included in their fun times and it makes me feel uneasy. I've tried to talk to her about it but she says she only drinks when she wants to. I've stopped going on Instagram to avoid seeing pictures of them together. I want to learn to accept that it's okay that she has fun with him more.

---

This post is a great example of how social media can exacerbate feelings of jealousy and insecurity in a relationship. The OP (original poster) is feeling left out and uneasy about his girlfriend's close bond with her gay best friend, and is using social media to fuel his feelings of jealousy. By stopping going on Instagram, the OP is taking a step towards avoiding triggers that make him feel bad, but it's not addressing the underlying issue.

The OP's concerns about his girlfriend's drinking habits and the influence it may have on her are valid, but it's not directly related to his jealousy. It's possible that the OP is using this as a way to justify his feelings of jealousy, rather than addressing the root cause.

The best way for the OP to get over his jealousy is to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings. He should express his concerns and listen to her perspective, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. It's also important for the OP to focus on building a stronger connection with his girlfriend and finding ways to include her in his life, rather than comparing himself to her best friend.

In terms of advice, the OP could try the following:

* Have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns.
* Focus on building a stronger connection with his girlfriend and finding ways to include her in his life.

TITLE: Fresh out of college and can't seem to land a programming job

POST: I graduated in Dec. 2010, and since then have been unable to get a programming job in my area.  Since my area is the state of Mississippi I decided to look elsewhere.  New Orleans is close by but all my attempts have given me nothing.  I have a friend in San Francisco and have started looking for work there, but so far nothing.  I haven't applied to many places in SF though because I'm unsure of the quality of many of the places.

I'm worried that no REAL work experience is hurting me.  Only experience I've got under my belt is fixing computers and setting up networks for local businesses.  I did that for money since high school.  I've placed in two competitions for innovative design for two projects at school -- one of which won first place ($3500).  Other than these things I don't really have much else.

If anyone has any pointers or knows of some places to submit a resume to I'm ALL EARS.  I'm currently working a minimum wage job helping out a friend, and am getting tired of looking like the town idiot who has a degree but no job.

TL;DR: Fresh out of college, can't get a programming job, looking for advice and job leads.

COMMENT 1:

Hey OP, I feel your pain. I was in a similar situation after graduating. Here's a piece of advice: don't be afraid to take on internships or freelance work to get your foot in the door. It may not pay as much, but it'll give you some experience and a portfolio to show potential employers. Also, consider moving to a city with a stronger tech industry. San Francisco is a great place to be, but it's super competitive. You might have better luck in a smaller city with a growing tech scene.

COMMENT 2:

I'm from Mississippi too, and I know how tough it can be to find a job in the tech industry. I'd recommend looking into online job boards like We Work Remotely or Remote OK. They have a lot of programming jobs that can be done remotely, which might be a good option for you. Also, consider reaching out to companies directly and asking if they have any openings. Sometimes companies don't advertise their job openings publicly, so it's worth a shot.

COMMENT 3:

OP, I'm a developer in SF and I'd be happy to take a look at your resume and give you some feedback. I've been in your shoes before, and I know how tough it can be to get started. Send me your resume and I'll give you some advice on how to improve it and make it more attractive to potential employers.

COMMENT 4:

I'm not a programmer, but I'm a recruiter and I've worked with a lot of developers. One thing that's important to remember is that many companies are looking for people with specific skills, like Java or Python. If you're not familiar with those languages, it might be worth taking some online courses to learn them. Also, make sure your resume is tailored to the specific job you're applying for. Don't just send out the same resume to every job you see. Take the time to customize it and highlight your relevant skills.

COMMENT 5:

OP, I'm a developer in New Orleans and I'd be happy to chat with you about job opportunities in the area. We have a growing tech industry here, and there are a lot of companies that are looking for talented developers. If you're interested, send me a message and we can set up a time to talk.

The comments on this post are a great example of the helpful and supportive community that exists on Reddit. The OP is seeking advice and job leads, and the commenters are happy to provide them. The comments offer a range of advice, from taking on internships or freelance work to reaching out to companies directly and customizing one's resume. The commenters also offer to help the OP in various ways, such as reviewing their resume or providing job leads in specific cities. Overall, the comments on this post demonstrate the value of online communities like Reddit in providing support and resources to people who are looking for help.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband [40 M] of three years, weirded out by friendship with co-worker

POST: This is my second marriage, his first.  We have two kids.  For a couple of years, I've gotten a bad vibe from one of his female co-workers.  They are good friends, and get along really well.  They're both musicians.  He really likes her and wants to be able to hang out with her after work, like grabbing a beer with her.  I know he texts her sometimes outside of work hours but not sure how often or what about (he's pretty secretive with his phone).  It makes me super uncomfortable and he knows this. 

 We had a pretty big blowout a few months ago when she was throwing a party and I asked him not to go.  He thinks I'm totally irrational about her and gets angry whenever I try to talk to him about this.  He was going to go to the party regardless of how I felt about it so we ended up going together and it was fine.  

I have tried to just drop it since the party.  I feel like he knows how I feel and that's all I can really do.  He hasn't been going for drinks with her or anything, which I appreciate.   I have recently found out, though, that this woman has a reputation for being a "home wrecker."  My husband said it's because she went one a date with her married friend while he was separated from his wife.  This is making me feel even more uneasy about her and my husband's friendship.  I know rumor mills can get carried away, especially in a small town.  But I can't help but feel a little justified in wanting them to not be friends now that I know this.

More relevant information.... My first marriage ended because he met someone else.  So it's entirely possible I'm over reacting about this situation because of that.  I've been in therapy for over three years and feel like I've made great strides.  My husband occasionally goes to therapy with me but it hasn't been very helpful.  He gets impatient taking about the same thing over and over (his words).

TL;DR: Husband's female co-worker is a "home wrecker" with a reputation for being a bit of a troublemaker.  I'm uncomfortable with their friendship and feel like he's not taking my concerns seriously.  I'm not sure what to do or how to make him understand where I'm coming from.

This post is a great example of how a subreddit like r/relationships can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their concerns and receive advice from others who have gone through similar experiences. The OP (original poster) is clearly uncomfortable with her husband's friendship with his co-worker, and is seeking reassurance that her feelings are valid.

The post is well-written and provides a lot of relevant information, including the OP's history with her first marriage and her current therapy sessions. This helps to give context to her concerns and makes it easier for readers to understand where she's coming from.

The comments on this post are also very helpful and supportive. Many readers offer words of encouragement and validation, telling the OP that her feelings are normal and that she's not overreacting. Others provide advice on how to approach the situation, such as having an open and honest conversation with her husband about her concerns.

Overall, this post is a great example of how a subreddit like r/relationships can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their concerns and receive advice from others who have gone through similar experiences.

TITLE: I [20 M] have been dating a girl [19 F] for about two weeks; her crazy ex has been threatening the both of us.

POST: I met a girl on Tinder for a casual hookup. There ended up being good chemistry between the two of us and we transitioned into dating. We've had five dates so far and everything has been quite well except for her abusive ex of 8 months getting involved. She had broken up with him about 4 months ago and I was her first venture back into the dating scene. As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.

Shortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number. The two times we've spoken he told me in a very threatening manner that he happens to have friends in various biker gangs and doesn't appreciate me seeing her. He then gave me an ultimatum to either stop seeing her OR to not set foot into "his city". I've only talked to him for 30 minutes or so; but I've come to the conclusion that he isn't the most mentally stable individual.

I'm not a fan of getting involved in situations like this; I tend to avoid conflicts because my time and effort is better spent doing more productive things. And because of my lack of experience dealing with threats and unstable individuals, I'm reaching out to you /r/relationships. She has told me that he has never followed through with any of his threats over the past few months of being broken up, but I feel as if him seeing her with a significant other might be enough to give him initiative to actually do something.

So, what would my best course of action be? I really do like this girl, and have a date in the city planned with her on Sunday. But on the other side of things I'd rather not put myself in a situation where I may be at risk.

TL;DR: I'm dating a girl who has a crazy ex who's been threatening us both. He's been calling her phone, leaving threatening voice-mails, and even got my number and gave me an ultimatum. I'm not sure what to do, and I'm worried about my safety.

**Comments:**

* "OP, you need to take this seriously. Threats are not empty words, especially when they're coming from someone who's already shown a pattern of abuse. I would suggest talking to the police about this and getting a restraining order. It's not worth risking your safety for a relationship."
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to prioritize your safety and well-being. If the girl is willing to take on this risk, that's her decision, but you shouldn't be putting yourself in harm's way. Consider ending the relationship or taking a break until this situation is resolved."
* "I'm not sure if you're aware, but it's not uncommon for abusers to use threats and intimidation to control their victims. It's possible that this guy is just trying to exert control over your girlfriend and is using you as a way to do so. You need to be careful and not get drawn into his drama."
* "I think you should talk to your girlfriend about this and see how she feels about the situation. If she's willing to work with you to get a restraining order and take steps to protect herself, then maybe it's worth continuing the relationship. But if she's not taking this seriously or is downplaying the threats, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I'm a lawyer and I would advise you to seek legal advice about this situation. A restraining order could be a good option, and it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to threats and violence." (This comment was removed by the OP due to being off-topic)

**OP's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice and concerns. I'll definitely be talking to my girlfriend about this and seeing how she feels about the situation. I'm not sure if I'm ready to end the relationship just yet, but I do need to prioritize my safety. I'll also look into getting a restraining order, just in case. Thanks again for all the help and support." (Edit: I've talked to my girlfriend and she's willing to work with me to get a restraining order and take steps to protect herself. We're going to continue the relationship, but with a lot more caution and awareness of the situation.)"

TITLE: I caught her with another guy by using the Find My iPhone website. Not sure if ill ever trust her again.

POST: 30 year old male here about to break up with the girl I saw myself marrying.
So I have had issues trusting my gf, we have been together for 2.5 years now. in march of 2010 I caught her coming home (we have lived in my place together for entire relationship) and she was out drinking with an ex boyfriend. I sucked it up and accepted her apology and have been dealing with it ever since. This is about the time I registered her phone with the Find My Iphone service.
Fast forward to Monday night- I get texts form her saying she was going out to pick us up some food. I come home from work late around 7pm and she is not home. she wont answer my calls or texts. I know where she is cause I pulled up Find My Iphone website and she is at the local bar down the street. I wait for 3 hours and finally get a text of her saying she was at her girlfriends house and she will be home soon. LIAR! I had enough and stormed off to confront her at the bar. Didn't see the car she was driving in the parking lot so I'm starting to think im wrong, But there it is parked IN THE BACK. as if to hide from me.
I found her and a guy she works with (restaurant, typical for sleeping with coworkers).
Now we are a mess and Im about to throw her out and start my life over, Sucks cause I wanted to marry this one.
She doesn't know I tracked her with the iPhone. And I don't think Ill ever trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex? In my eyes she lied to be with another guy while i was at work and that's cheating in my book.
Any advice is appreciated.
Also this is my first ever post to reddit and im using a throwaway account.

TL;DR: Caught my girlfriend with another guy at a bar using Find My iPhone. She lied about where she was and I'm struggling to trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex?

**Top comments:**

* "Dude, you're not a stalker. You're a concerned partner who wants to know where his girlfriend is. And yeah, it's still cheating even if you didn't catch them having sex. She lied to you and put herself in a situation where she could be with someone else. You deserve better than that."
* "I'm not saying it's okay to track someone's phone, but I do think you have a right to know where your partner is. And yeah, it's still cheating. You're not a fool for wanting to know what's going on in your relationship."
* "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what happened. Don't accuse her of cheating, but express how you feel and why you're upset. You might be surprised at what she has to say. And yeah, it's still cheating, but it's also a sign of deeper issues in your relationship."
* "I'm not sure if I would have done what you did, but I do think you have a right to know where your partner is. And yeah, it's still cheating. You deserve better than someone who can't be honest with you."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you felt the need to track your girlfriend's phone. Is it because you don't trust her? Is it because you're feeling insecure? You need to address these feelings before you can move forward in your relationship."

**Subreddit community response:**

Overall, the community response was mixed, but most users agreed that the OP's girlfriend's behavior was unacceptable and that it was important for him to prioritize his own emotional well-being and consider seeking counseling to work through their issues.

TITLE: Finally got a date with a crush of 7 years, but it comes with a catch.

POST: So me of 21 finally got a confirmation that the girl(21), will allow me to take her on a "date".  That made me extremely happy was finally able to "grow the balls" and ask. Which in return she said yes. Things are going great so far as a long distance relationship.

There are two major problems though. The first is that I'm currently in Germany on a tour for another 4 months. So the next time I'll be able to see her and actually take her on the date will be when I come home for PCS leave(In the army). We talk every day Via Phone and Skype etc, which is nice even though I've known her for 7 years this is really the first time I have been able to see her personality for what it is, and it is amazing. She really is Liking the LDR, because she says the last couple of boy friends she has been with sex has been really involved and obscured what she has really wanted. She says she brags about me all the time about how I'm Sweet and charming and thing of the like. What are your problems, success stories to help motivate me in that way. 

The second thing is as much as I like her, she has HSV-1. With the amount of research I've done on this topic I'm skeptical about it. I am clean. I just don't know what to do. I like her...way to much for my own good, just to drop it off because of cold sores down below. As i mentioned above do you guys have any success stories, problems with a situation like this? I would really like some advice and other out looks then the obvious one of dude shes got the herp, just leave it, don't ever touch it.

TL;DR: Got a date with a crush of 7 years, but it comes with a catch. I'm in Germany for 4 months, and she has HSV-1. I'm unsure what to do.

TITLE: (22/M) Just recently out of a relationship with a (22/F), looking for a silver lining if it exists. Please help

POST: I dated a girl (22) for a year and a half. We split in summer because I moved to Florida for summer. She got a job in Panama city, right when I came home from Florida. 

I'll spare the details but she met up with a boy who she met after knowing on the Internet for 6 years. He lived 3.5 hours away from her. The day they met in real life he asked her out. She said yes. 

Fast forward 1 month... he moved in with her and they say I love you to eachother and I only found this out after creeping on her tumblr. Big mistake. But she'll text me every fucking week trying to be friendly I want nothing to do with her. But I still love her and haven't moved on. I was hoping she would eventually come back up to philly and we would work on things. Because I thought her behavior was extreme and just a front and irrational.

 How could a relationship with a stranger from the Internet work when he lives 3.5 hours away? Well after two or three weeks they live together and say I love you to eachother. Now I'm really depressed and feel like shit. Can anyone help, or try and explain what's going on?

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend met a guy online, moved in with him after a month, and says I love you. I'm still in love with her and feel like I got played. Help me find a silver lining or move on.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you gotta let go. She's moved on and you're still stuck in the past. You deserve better than someone who's gonna play you like that."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's tough to accept that someone you loved is gone, but you gotta focus on yourself now. Take some time to heal and find what makes you happy again."
* "I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. You can't control how others feel or behave. You did what you thought was right, and now it's time to move on. Don't waste your time trying to get her back or prove a point. Just focus on your own happiness."
* "I'm a bit of a cynic, but I think you're just not over her yet. Give it some time, and you'll realize that she's not worth your time and energy. You deserve someone who's gonna treat you with respect and honesty."
* "I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, but it sounds like your ex was always planning on leaving you. She met someone online and was already looking for an escape route. You can't blame yourself for not seeing it coming, but you gotta accept that it's over and move on."
* "I think you're being too focused on what she did and not enough on what you can do to improve yourself. Take this as an opportunity to work on yourself and become a better person. You never know what's around the corner."

This post is a great example of how people on Reddit's r/relationships subreddit can provide helpful and supportive advice to those going through a tough time. The OP (original poster) is clearly still reeling from the breakup and is struggling to come to terms with his ex's new relationship. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from the harsh reality check ("Dude, you gotta let go") to the more empathetic and supportive ("I'm so sorry you're going through this").

Some common themes that emerge from the comments include:

* The importance of moving on and focusing on one's own happiness
* The need to accept that relationships end and that it's not always possible to change the outcome
* The importance of self-reflection and personal growth in the aftermath of a breakup
* The need to prioritize one's own emotional well-being and not get caught up in trying to prove a point or get revenge

Overall, the comments on this post demonstrate the value of online support communities like r/relationships, where people can share their experiences and receive helpful advice and guidance from others who have been through similar situations.

TITLE: [F29] Is there something in between casual sex and LTR?

POST: Three years ago I ended a 6 yr relationship, and it left me with a lot of trust issues. A few months after the split, my ex felt he needed to "clear the air" so that we could have a chance at reconciling. That involved my learning I had been completely oblivious to cheating, lying, and an arrest (yup, he went to jail for a few days and I had no idea). I know what you're thinking, that I am just super dumb. I wish that was the case, I'm college educated and have a professional career, just plain old gullible. In the aftermath, I have spent a year having exclusive relationships, the next having one night stands, and the last online dating. For the record online dating does nothing to improve trust issues, I had on guy tell me he slept with Cameron Diaz and another try to steal a set of golf clubs (and those are just the gems). 

This afternoon the guy I have been seeing on and off for the last six months finally agreed to keep things casual. Now, I am free to date and see whomever I choose, and am contemplating whether I want to go the online route again. My casual relationships thus far have involved ignoring lies because the details aren't important. This isn't one sided, I fib about where I am when I'm out with other guys. Unfortunately, when I notice them my history and fear makes ignoring feel self-deprecating, and I struggle to forgive myself for ages after the bad ones.  On the other hand, I am just not ready for the LTR I want, one missed text or phone call and I flip, but I'm not attracted to someone who caters to my every wish in the long term. So Reddit, I need suggestions on what to do next. 

- Side Note – During this last relationship I was in a place to tell my SO about how scared of lies I am and it got a lot better, so I know that in time it will get easier.

TL;DR: I'm a 29-year-old woman who has been struggling with trust issues after a toxic relationship. I've tried exclusive relationships, one-night stands, and online dating, but nothing seems to work for me. I'm considering going back to online dating, but I'm unsure if I'm ready for it. I'm looking for suggestions on what to do next.

TITLE: What alarming/unusual thing has happened to you to make you rethink certain travel destinations?

POST: A couple months ago I went to Miami with a female friend of mine. Little did I know I would encounter creeps everywhere - literally men waiting on the side of the road to approach us at night. On the second day there, we were walking to the parking lot to add more time for the space. It was about 6PM and there was a lot of foot/road traffic in the area. I can't remember if I was looking down at my phone or not, but my friend was walking a few feet ahead of me. Suddenly, a couple of guys pass me pretty close and I hear an aerosol spray and smell nothing but ether/paint thinner (no idea). Almost instantly I feel nauseous and have a strong head-to-toe light headed feeling, like I'm passing out. When I caught my breath I turned around and saw the two guys lingering by a parking meter watching me, then they walked away. My friend didn't see/hear anything happen, and I didn't tell anybody else walking around. I instantly felt freaked out and didn't feel right for the next hour. Needless to say, I left that night. I felt like I was in Taken 2 and there was no Liam Neeson to save my ass. I'll probably never go back to seedy Miami.

TL;DR: I went to Miami with a friend and encountered creeps everywhere. One night, I was sprayed with an unknown substance that made me feel nauseous and light-headed. I left the city immediately and won't be going back.

TITLE: What's the most unsettling experience you've had while traveling?

POST: I was backpacking through Eastern Europe with a group of friends. We were in a small town in Poland, and we decided to take a night bus to a nearby city. We got to the bus station, and it was pretty deserted. We found our bus and got on, but as we were settling in, I noticed that the driver seemed really sketchy. He was muttering to himself, and his eyes kept darting back and forth. I tried to brush it off, but my friends and I were all getting a little uneasy.

As we hit the road, the driver started making some really weird turns. We were going down these tiny, winding roads that seemed to go nowhere. I was starting to get really worried, and my friends were all freaking out. We asked the driver where we were going, and he just kept saying "soon, soon" over and over again.

After what felt like an eternity, the bus finally stopped at a random gas station. The driver got out, and we were all like "okay, we're getting off here." But then he came back on the bus and started yelling at us in Polish. We had no idea what he was saying, but it was clear he was getting really aggressive. We were all terrified, and we didn't know what to do.

Luckily, another passenger on the bus spoke some English and translated for us. He told us that the driver was trying to get us to get off the bus and go to some random hotel with him. We were all like "no way, we're getting off this bus and finding a real hotel." So we grabbed our stuff and got off the bus.

We ended up having to spend the night in a weird, rundown hotel that was literally in the middle of nowhere. It was definitely an unsettling experience, but we were all just relieved to be safe. We never took that bus again, and we made sure to research our transportation options a lot more thoroughly after that.

TL;DR: I was on a night bus in Poland with a group of friends, and the driver seemed really sketchy. He took us on a weird route, and we were all getting really worried. He tried to get us to get off the bus and go to a random hotel with him, but we refused and ended up spending the night in a weird hotel in the middle of nowhere. It was definitely an unsettling experience, but we were all just relieved to be safe.

TITLE: Why would anyone want to call themselves a gamer? (Rant)

POST: I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying "I'm a TV watcher" or "music listener." Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with "gamers."

"CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell." 

This hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because "that's what casuals play." The whole PC master race also irritates me. Who really gives a shit what someones console preference is?

I can't even finish my rant. It frustrates me that I ever called myself a gamer as a kid anyway. It's just so dumb.

TL;DR: I play video games but refuse to call myself a gamer because it's become too mainstream and I think the culture surrounding it is ridiculous.

COMMENTS:

* "I feel the same way, I play games but I don't identify as a gamer. I think it's because I don't fit the stereotype of what a gamer is supposed to be."
* "I used to call myself a gamer but then I realized that it's just a label. I play games because I enjoy them, not because I want to be part of some subculture."
* "I think you're being a bit harsh. Gaming is a hobby and it's okay to enjoy it. You don't have to identify as a gamer to play games."
* "I agree with you, the gaming community can be pretty toxic and pretentious. I prefer to just play games and not worry about what others think."
* "I think you're missing the point. Gaming is about more than just playing games. It's about the community, the culture, and the passion. You can't just dismiss it as'mainstream' and expect to be taken seriously."
* "I'm a gamer and I don't care what you think. I play games because I enjoy them and I'm not going to let your opinions dictate how I identify myself."
* "I think you're being a bit too critical. Gaming is a hobby and it's okay to have fun. You don't have to take it so seriously."
* "I agree with you, the gaming community can be pretty toxic and pretentious. I prefer to just play games and not worry about what others think."

This post and its comments highlight the ongoing debate within the gaming community about what it means to be a "gamer." Some people identify strongly with the label and see it as a badge of honor, while others view it as a shallow or pretentious label that doesn't accurately reflect their passion for gaming. The post's author is particularly critical of the gaming community's obsession with mainstream games and its tendency to look down on those who don't fit the stereotype of what a "gamer" is supposed to be. The comments section is filled with a mix of agreement and disagreement, with some people defending the label and others dismissing it as unnecessary or pretentious. Overall, the post and its comments reflect the ongoing debate within the gaming community about what it means to be a "gamer" and whether the label is still relevant in the modern gaming landscape.

TITLE: Me [16M] am in love for the first time and it hurts.

POST: Hello, 

I'm a 16y/o male and im in love with a girl [16]. This is the first time i'm in love and it is really exchausting. I am 100% sure i am not ready for a relation yet and i don't want it either. I almost never talk with her so our relationship is non existing. Another thing is that someone else also likes her and it keeps getting in my head because they regularly chill with each other. I am at a point were i am so in love that i can't  focus on school anymore. I never had this feeling before and its a first time for me. The feeling i get is really exchausting. My heart rate goes up really high and i get a weird feeling in my stomach.

I started to like her about 5 months ago and i am really in love since 1 week ago. I don't know what to do and i don't think this will go away soon.

(Sorry for the really bad english grammar i'm not native.)

TL;DR: I'm 16 and in love for the first time, it's exhausting and I don't know what to do. I'm not ready for a relationship and someone else likes her too.

---

**Comments:**

* "Hey, it's normal to feel overwhelmed by your first love. Take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to do to make it work. Remember that you're 16 and still in school, so prioritize your education too." - u/relationshipadvice
* "I was in a similar situation when I was 16. I ended up talking to the girl and we became friends. It was a good way to get to know her without putting too much pressure on the relationship. Maybe try talking to her and see where it goes?" - u/firstlove
* "Don't worry about the other guy, focus on yourself and what you want. If you're not ready for a relationship, it's okay to take a step back and focus on yourself. Remember that you're not alone and there are people who care about you." - u/relationshipgoals
* "I'm not a relationship expert, but I think you should take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to do to make it work. Maybe try talking to a trusted adult, like a teacher or a counselor, for some advice." - u/unsure

TITLE: M25 needs help asking F23 out on a date. But it's more complicated than that.

POST: Hello! I'[M] 25 and single. I was wondering if you guys could please help me out with some advice on asking a girl out. I met this [F23], Elizabeth (pseudonym), last year at university while she and I were in a one year program together - we never met prior to this. We spent the better part of a year in close proximity, having mutual friends and hanging out. From the moment I saw her I was attracted - she was smart and pretty. Unfortunately, I could never get myself to ask her out. A part of me kept saying she's not interested because I never talked to her everyday, just whenever there was the occasional get together with mutual friends would there be some small talk. With the program over since last December 2014, I have never been able to get her off my mind. I have her on Facebook and I have her cell phone number, but I've never messaged her. I really want to ask her out, but I don't know what to do. Also, she lives in a different city than I do (~45 mins away). What should I do? Your help is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: M25 wants to ask F23 out on a date, but has been too afraid to do so. They've known each other for a year, but never really talked one-on-one. They're unsure of how to approach her and are seeking advice.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. You've known her for a year, so she probably knows you're interested. Just pick a time and place where you both feel comfortable and have a conversation. Don't overthink it too much."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "OP, I think you're making this way more complicated than it needs to be. You've known her for a year, and you've never had a chance to talk to her one-on-one? That's not a good sign. Maybe it's time to move on and find someone who is interested in you. You deserve better than someone who doesn't even notice you."
3. **u/throwaway789**: "OP, I think you should try to get to know her better before asking her out. You've known her for a year, but you've never really talked to her one-on-one. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about something you both like, and see if there's a connection there. If you feel like there's a connection, then you can ask her out. But if not, then maybe it's not meant to be."
4. **u/throwaway321**: "OP, I think you should just be yourself and be honest with her. If she's not interested, then that's okay. You can't force someone to like you. But if she is interested, then you'll know and you can take it from there. Just remember to respect her boundaries and don't pressure her if she says no."
5. **u/throwaway456**: "OP, I think you should try to get to know her better before asking her out. You've known her for a year, but you've never really talked to her one-on-one. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about something you both like, and see if there's a connection there. If you feel like there's a connection, then you can ask her out. But if not, then maybe it's not meant to be."

Overall, the responses are encouraging OP to be honest and open with Elizabeth, and to not overthink the situation. Some users suggest getting to know her better before asking her out, while others advise just being oneself and being honest about one's feelings. There is no clear consensus on the best approach, but the majority of users seem to be supportive of OP's desire to ask Elizabeth out.

TITLE: Am I wrong in my convictions about jealousy?

POST: 24,M / 23,F

In two of my previous relationships, I was the jealous type and have greatly learned my lesson from being that way. I am currently in a 2 year relationship in which my girlfriend and I live together. I love her, but because of things I've experienced, I am no longer the jealous type. I won't let myself behave like that again. She gets upset with me because I don't get jealous. Don't get me wrong, if a guy were to touch her I'd knock him out. But she tells me that it makes her feel like I don't take pride in her or value her because I don't get jealous that another guy might think she's attractive or something. Am I downplaying jealousy too much? I don't feel that there is anything healthy about jealousy in a relationship, but it seems she does.

TL;DR: I used to be jealous in past relationships, but I've learned my lesson and don't get jealous anymore. My girlfriend gets upset with me because I don't get jealous, saying it makes her feel unvalued. Am I wrong in my convictions about jealousy?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I think you're being too harsh on yourself. It's okay to have some level of jealousy, it's natural. But it sounds like you're not just not jealous, you're not even acknowledging the possibility that someone else might be interested in her. That can be hurtful to her. Maybe try to find a middle ground where you're not consumed by jealousy, but you're also showing her that you care about her and value her.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: I think you're misunderstanding what your girlfriend is saying. She's not saying you should be jealous, but that you should show her that you care about her and value her. Jealousy is not the only way to do that. Maybe try having open and honest conversations with her about how you feel and what you're trying to do. It might help you both understand each other better.
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I think you're being too quick to dismiss jealousy as "unhealthy". Jealousy can be a natural response to feeling threatened or insecure in a relationship. It's not always about being controlling or possessive. Maybe try to understand where your girlfriend is coming from and why she feels the way she does.
4. **u/throwaway456789**: I think you're being too focused on your own feelings and not considering your girlfriend's. Just because you don't feel jealous doesn't mean she doesn't feel insecure or threatened. Maybe try to be more empathetic and understanding of her feelings, even if you don't share them.

**TL;DR:** The commenters are suggesting that the OP is being too harsh on himself and that it's okay to have some level of jealousy, but also that he should try to find a middle ground and show his girlfriend that he cares about her and values her. They also suggest that he should try to understand where his girlfriend is coming from and why she feels the way she does. Some commenters are also suggesting that he should be more empathetic and understanding of his girlfriend's feelings, even if he doesn't share them.

TITLE: [26 M] My girlfriend is coming over to break up with me in 2 hours please help me find the words to make her change her mind.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. She is my best friend, and she is about to leave me. She went on a trip out of town for 12 days and barely called me. When she got home she was distant, hanging out with friends avoiding me. I grew angry and confronted her. I've always felt like I was second string to her friends, but I don't care about any of that now. I just want her to not leave a relationship we both loved and cherished for 5 years over a cold fight that lasted a little over 6 days. I've loved her since the moment I saw her, I just want her to give this more time.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is coming over to break up with me in 2 hours, I want to make her change her mind. Help me find the words to make her stay.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. But honestly, if she's already made up her mind, it's probably best to just let her go. You deserve someone who will fight for you and your relationship. Don't waste your time trying to change her mind, it's not worth the emotional toll it'll take on you."
* "I think you're being a bit too optimistic. If she's already decided to break up with you, it's probably because she's already made up her mind. You can't force someone to stay in a relationship they don't want to be in. Instead, focus on moving on and finding someone who truly loves and appreciates you."
* "I'm not sure if you're aware, but it sounds like your girlfriend has been distant and avoiding you for a while now. Maybe this break-up isn't just about the fight you had. Maybe it's about the underlying issues in your relationship. Have you considered counseling or talking to her about what's been going on?"
* "I think you should take this opportunity to reflect on your own feelings and needs. Are you staying in this relationship because you truly love and want to be with your girlfriend, or are you staying because you're scared of being alone? Take some time to figure that out and then make a decision that's best for you."
* "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, dude. If your girlfriend is coming over to break up with you, it's probably because she's already made up her mind. But hey, it's worth a shot to try to talk to her and see if there's anything you can do to salvage the relationship. Just be prepared for the possibility that it might not work out."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys. I think I'm going to take your words to heart and try to have an open and honest conversation with my girlfriend. I'm not going to force her to stay in the relationship if she doesn't want to, but I do want to try to understand what's going on and see if there's anything we can do to work through our issues. Thanks for the support and advice."

TITLE: Girl [25 F] with Male [28 M] can you go back to the getting to know phase once you have had sex?

POST: I wanted the internets opinion because my co-worker and I argued at length about this and got nowhere. 

So guy meets girl and they exchange numbers, talk and flirt all that jazz. They keep trying to organise a date but both are really busy. She suddenly decides to comes cover to guys house late one night, stays the night because he lives close to her work. They have sex.  

Now my question is can they go back to being a cute and trying to arrange a date and get to know each other or is she now a fuck buddy?

My view is she is now a fuck buddy. My co-worker says if he is really keen on her he will still take her out on a date because now he knows he will definitely get some.  I think he is just saying that just because.

TL;DR: Girl comes over to guys house, they have sex, can they go back to getting to know each other or is she now a fuck buddy?

---

**Top comments:**

* "I think it's a bit of both. She's already crossed the line by sleeping over, but if he's still interested in getting to know her as a person, he can still try to make it work. It's up to him to decide if he wants to keep it casual or try to build something more."
* "I think your co-worker has a point. If he's really into her, he'll still take her out on a date and try to get to know her better. But if he's just looking for a quick hookup, then yeah, she's probably just a fuck buddy now."
* "I think it's up to the girl to decide how she wants to proceed. If she's still interested in getting to know him, she can suggest going out on a date or doing something else that's not just about sex. But if she's only interested in the sex, then yeah, it's probably just a casual thing."
* "I think it's a bit of a gray area. If they're both on the same page and still want to get to know each other, then yeah, they can definitely go back to the getting-to-know-you phase. But if one of them is only looking for sex, then it's probably not going to work out."
* "I think the key is communication. They need to have an open and honest conversation about what they both want and expect from each other. If they're both on the same page, then they can definitely make it work. But if they're not, then it's probably best to just be honest and move on."

TITLE: Do American kids have a "dinosaur phase"?

POST: I'm from New Zealand. It's pretty much a secular country, ie politicians speaking about God is a big no-no. A lot of people are Christian but for the most part they are not fundamentalists, and most of them believe in evolution. Evolution is taught in science class in high school.

As a kid in New Zealand, pretty much every boy (and probably some girls) go through a "dinosaur phase", where they are really into dinosaurs. Their parents buy them dinosaur toys and book and computer games. The primary appeal is obviously the fact that dinosaurs are awesome giant scary monsters, but they also end up learning about the Cretaceous period and the Jurassic period and how many millions of years ago the dinosaurs lived.

So I read that [almost half of the American population doesn't believe in evolution] Coming from a scientific background, this just seems absolutely insane to me. Regardless of what you believe, the [body of evidence for evolution] is enormous enough that a person who denies it is denying fact and reason. But I don't want this is to turn into an evolution debate.

My question is, if a large portion of America doesn't believe in evolution, then do they still let their kids learn about dinosaurs? Do the kids still have a "dinosaur phase"? I know Creationists have a few ways of [justifying dinosaurs without evolution] but it just seems to me that the topic of dinosaurs is something that most Creationist parents would want to sweep under the carpet. I don't know.

Caveat: I know things are different in different states and different communities. If you don't want to generalise, tell me about your specific upbringing.

TL;DR: Do American kids still have a "dinosaur phase" if their parents don't believe in evolution?

---

This post is an interesting example of a cross-cultural comparison, where the author is trying to understand the differences in how children are raised and educated in the United States compared to New Zealand. The author is curious about whether American children still go through a "dinosaur phase" if their parents do not believe in evolution. The post is also a good example of how cultural and religious beliefs can influence the way children learn about science and the natural world.

The comments on this post are varied and interesting, with some people sharing their own experiences of having a "dinosaur phase" as children, while others discuss the ways in which creationist beliefs can influence the way children learn about science. Some people also share their own experiences of teaching children about dinosaurs and evolution, and how they try to balance their own beliefs with the need to teach children about the scientific method and the evidence for evolution.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the AskReddit community can facilitate interesting and informative discussions about cultural and scientific topics. It also highlights the importance of considering the cultural and religious beliefs of others when discussing scientific topics, and the need for open-mindedness and respect in these discussions.

TITLE: Me [32F] with my BF [35M] three years, he broke up with me suddenly via email and then asked to stay together still.

POST: Up until last week everything seemed fine to me. We were not fighting and there were no major issues. Then seemingly out of the blue he was depressed/upset for a few days, then he broke it off with me via email. A day later he asked to talk about it and he decided he wants to stay together to work on the problems together (apparently he felt like he was losing himself and it was all about me, although he said I did nothing to make him feel that way, it was his mindset).

I ended up taking him back but I am not sure if I am ignoring a huge red flag here. This was completely out of character and I feel like everyone makes mistakes, but am I being a doormat?

TL;DR: BF broke up with me via email, then asked to stay together to work on problems, I took him back. Am I ignoring a huge red flag?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I would say you're ignoring a huge red flag. If he was feeling so lost and unhappy, why didn't he talk to you about it before breaking up with you via email? It sounds like he was looking for an easy way out and then changed his mind when he realized he couldn't find someone else. I would take some time to think about whether you really want to be with someone who can't even have a real conversation with you when things get tough."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're being a doormat. If someone can't even be bothered to have a real conversation with you when they're unhappy, they're not worth your time. You deserve better than someone who can just email you and then expect you to take them back without even trying to work through the issues together. Take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want in a relationship."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I think you're being a bit too harsh. It sounds like your BF was going through a tough time and didn't know how to deal with his emotions. Maybe he was scared of losing you and didn't know how to express himself. It's not uncommon for people to make mistakes in relationships. If you're willing to work through the issues together, maybe it's worth giving it another shot. Just make sure to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and concerns."
4. **RedFlagRanger**: "I agree with the others, this is a huge red flag. If someone can't even have a real conversation with you when they're unhappy, it's a sign of deeper issues. You deserve someone who can communicate openly and honestly with you, even when things get tough. Take some time to think about whether you really want to be with someone who can't even be bothered to have a real conversation with you."
5. **LoveIsABlindness**: "I think you're being too quick to judge. Maybe your BF was going through a tough time and didn't know how to deal with his emotions. Maybe he was scared of losing you and didn't know how to express himself. It's not uncommon for people to make mistakes in relationships. If you're willing to work through the issues together, maybe it's worth giving it another shot. Just make sure to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and concerns." (Note: This comment is similar to the previous one, but with a slightly different tone.)

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are divided, with some users advising the OP to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship, while others suggest that the OP should give the relationship another chance. The common thread among the comments is that the OP should prioritize open and honest communication in the relationship. The post highlights the importance of communication in relationships and the potential consequences of ignoring red flags. It also shows how people can have different perspectives on the same situation, and how it's important to consider multiple viewpoints when making decisions about one's relationships.

TITLE: [Realtionships] Me [21 F] with my husband [31 M] of 1 1/2 years, keeps trying to suckle my breasts during sex and doesnt really respect my boundaries.

POST: We were intimate after I apologized for being very nitpicky and argumentative lately and he said he really wanted to suck on my breasts (which I know he loves and I do let him do sometimes) He attempted to once and I stopped him and continued but once the second time came around (attempting to do it again) I pushed his face away got upset and stopped sex. I asked what he was doing and he claims he was not trying to do this and "doesnt know" what he was trying to do.  He also got upset that he didnt climax and I got upset that I felt I was disrespected and made to feel uncomfortable and then guilty on top off that.

TL;DR: Husband of 1 1/2 years keeps trying to suckle my breasts during sex, doesn't respect my boundaries, and gets upset when I stop him.

---

**Community Response:**

* Many users express shock and concern for the OP's situation, with some sharing their own experiences with similar issues.
* Some users suggest that the husband's behavior may be a sign of deeper issues, such as a lack of respect or a need for control.
* Others recommend that the OP have an open and honest conversation with her husband about her feelings and boundaries, and that she should not feel guilty for setting those boundaries.
* A few users suggest that the husband's behavior may be a form of sexual entitlement, and that the OP should prioritize her own comfort and consent.

**Notable Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your husband is not respecting your boundaries and is prioritizing his own desires over your comfort. You deserve so much better than that."
* "It's not okay for him to try to do that without your consent, and it's even worse that he gets upset when you stop him. You need to have a serious conversation with him about this and make it clear that it's not okay."
* "I've been in similar situations before, and it's so important to prioritize your own comfort and consent. Don't feel guilty for setting boundaries - it's okay to say no and it's okay to prioritize yourself."
* "This sounds like a classic case of sexual entitlement. Your husband needs to learn that sex is a mutual experience and that you have the right to say no to anything that makes you uncomfortable."

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of one year, I can't figure out if we should stay together or not.

POST: So I have no doubt that I love my boyfriend. We've had a really tough first year. Lots of short break ups. I've been dealing with a new anxiety problem and its been tough on both of us. 

At one point we broke up long enough that I met someone very interesting, went on a date, had the best sex of my life. I remembered what it felt like to be lusted after or wanted.

Ever since that break I can't decide if I want to be with him or be single. What I love about being single is feeling wanted. I know my bf loves me but he never lusts for me. If I ever have doubts he never fights for our relationship. He tells me he just wants me to be happy, but if he showed some passion towards being with me it would fufil that need to be wanted. 

Also our relationship is kind of stagnate. Were both in the same exact situation as last year. I'm worried that he isn't focused enough on becoming successful. 

But our relationship provides love, comfort, support, the best friendship I've ever had, openness. These things I know I won't find from dating. And these things are so important for me. 

For some reason feeling wanted makes me feel like I'm at my best. I'm the most confident I can be. I feel good. And this need is enough to make me doubt wanting to be in my relationship. I literally cannot decide which is more important to me.

TL;DR: I'm 20F, been with my 22M boyfriend for a year, we've had a tough year, I've had doubts, met someone interesting, feel wanted when single, but our relationship provides love, comfort, support, and friendship.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of insecurity and a desire for validation. It's normal to feel this way, especially in a long-term relationship. Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your needs and desires. Remember that it's okay to communicate your feelings and needs to your partner, and it's okay if they don't meet them all the time."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It sounds like you're torn between the comfort and security of your current relationship and the thrill and excitement of being single. It's a tough decision, but it might be helpful to think about what you want from your relationship. Do you want to feel wanted and desired, or do you want to feel loved and supported? It's possible to have both, but it might require some effort and communication from your partner."
3. **u/anonymous123456**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on your boyfriend to meet your needs. It's not his job to make you feel wanted or desired. You need to work on building your own self-confidence and self-worth. It's okay to feel insecure sometimes, but it's not your partner's responsibility to fix it. Maybe try focusing on your own personal growth and development instead of relying on your partner to make you feel good about yourself."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "It sounds like you're struggling with a common issue in long-term relationships - feeling like you're stuck in a rut. It's normal to feel this way, especially when you're not feeling challenged or stimulated in your relationship. Have you talked to your boyfriend about your feelings and desires? It might be helpful to have a conversation about what you both want from your relationship and how you can work together to make it more exciting and fulfilling."
5. **u/throwaway789012**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to feel uncertain and unsure about your relationship. It's normal to have doubts and fears. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and what you do have, rather than what you don't have. Remember that relationships are about compromise and communication. It's okay if you don't have everything you want, but it's important to communicate your needs and desires to your partner."

TITLE: Me [29/M] with my girlfriend [32/F] 2 years, her ex-boyfriends family.

POST: my current girlfriend of two years as a close relationship with her ex-boyfriends family. And she wants to go hang out with them (ex won't be present) me personally don't like the idea and I think is wrong and disrespectful. She knows I don't like it that's why she has not seen them since we been together but still talks to them biweekly at least once. She invited me to come with her but I don't think that's a good idea and it will be really awkward. But she says she's going to see them soon with or without me and I don't know how to deal with this. What would you do if you are in this position? Also do you think it's worth leaving somebody over it?

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to hang out with her ex-boyfriend's family, I don't like the idea and think it's wrong. She wants me to come with her, but I don't think it's a good idea and it will be awkward. What would you do in this situation?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's her decision who she wants to hang out with, but it's also your decision who you want to be with. If you're not comfortable with her spending time with her ex's family, you need to have an open and honest conversation with her about it. It's not about being controlling or possessive, it's about being honest about your feelings and boundaries. If she's not willing to respect your boundaries, then it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable about this situation. However, it's important to remember that your girlfriend's relationships with her ex's family are not a reflection of her feelings for you. It's possible that she's just trying to maintain a connection with them for her own reasons. That being said, it's still important to communicate your feelings and boundaries with her. You could try saying something like, 'Hey, I understand that you want to stay in touch with your ex's family, but it makes me uncomfortable. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?'"
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure why you're so opposed to her hanging out with her ex's family. It's not like she's going to fall in love with them again or anything. It's just a social visit. If you're really that uncomfortable, maybe you should have a conversation with her about it. But honestly, it seems like you're just being a bit controlling. Let her do what she wants and focus on your own relationships with your own family and friends."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should try to understand where your girlfriend is coming from. Maybe she's trying to maintain a connection with her ex's family because they were important to her during a difficult time in her life. It's not about you, it's about her. If you're really that uncomfortable, maybe you should have a conversation with her about it. But don't be too quick to judge her for wanting to stay in touch with her ex's family. It's not a reflection of her feelings for you."
5. **RealisticRuth**: "Look, relationships are all about compromise. If you're really that uncomfortable with your girlfriend hanging out with her ex's family, then maybe you should have a conversation with her about it. But don't expect her to cut ties with them completely. It's not realistic. Maybe you could suggest doing something else together instead, like going out with friends or trying a new restaurant. It's all about finding a compromise that works for both of you."

TITLE: My coworkers do not ask me[f21] to go to lunch with them

POST: I am a 21 year old female programmer intern at a very small company. This is my second time working here after interning in a previous semester. I get along well with a majority of my coworkers but I'm timid and I dont know how to say "Can I go to lunch with you guys?" When a group of them leaves to get food together. Every day one of the guys who started working here while I was gone comes in and asks a few of the guys to come to lunch with him. But no one ever asks me if I'd like to join. 

There are also 2 other interns. One of them makes it very clear, indirectly, he has no desire to interact with me socially (He was here last time). The other one is new and I havent said more than 10 words to him since we started, but I would like to try to be more social with my coworkers by going out to lunch with them and I dont know how to approach this situation without coming off needy or something? 

sorry if this is the wrong place; direct me to the right subreddit if there is a better one?

TL;DR: I'm a 21 year old female programmer intern who wants to go to lunch with her coworkers but is too shy to ask. She's worried about coming off needy and doesn't know how to approach the situation.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations where I wanted to socialize with my coworkers but was too afraid to ask. Here's what I did: I started small. I'd say something like 'Hey, are you guys going to grab lunch soon?' or 'Do you guys usually go out for lunch?' It's a low-key way to show interest and see if anyone is interested in including you. If they say no, don't take it personally and just focus on your work. But if they say yes, you can start to build a rapport with them. Just remember, it's okay to be a little awkward at first. People are more likely to include you if you show genuine interest and don't come on too strong."

TITLE: How do I [24M] move forward with live-in SO [34F]?

POST: The points: 

* I work in IT and am a pretty solitary guy, having her in my life makes me so much more at ease.  I have general anxiety so this is important.  

* I've never really felt "love" from anyone but her, I had a messed up childhood so having someone this close to me is new and exciting

* My college days were relatively intense, I'm yearning for the excitement of being single again but don't want to hurt SO, I'm constantly thinking about peers my age, eyes always wandering, not sexually attracted to SO anymore

* She's from another country on a student visa, been living with me for 8 months.  she moved in because she was living with 6 other girls in a 2br place, all worked at the same whip-wielding restaurant to pay for school

* Obviously hurting someone sucks and the feeling of being alone is terrifying (new city, no close friends)... but I do feel trapped, like I could be growing a lot more.  Was formerly polyamorous, jumped into this on impulse.  

* I told her I never intend on getting married or having kids.  She accepted that, we've been monogamous for 18 months 

* she doesn't know many other people so I offer some level of security, but taking that away by breaking up would ruin a big part of her life, she might go back home

TL;DR: I'm 24, live with 34F SO, have anxiety, never felt love before, but now I'm feeling trapped and restless, wondering if I should break up with her or find a way to make it work.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're 24 and you're feeling trapped? That's a normal feeling for anyone at that age. You're still figuring out who you are and what you want. Don't make any rash decisions. Have an open and honest conversation with your SO about how you're feeling. It's better to be honest and work through this together than to break up and potentially ruin her life."
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "I think you're feeling trapped because you're not being honest with yourself about your feelings. You said you're not sexually attracted to her anymore, but you're still living with her. That's not fair to either of you. You need to have a real talk with yourself about what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. If you're not attracted to her, it's not fair to keep her in a relationship just because you feel guilty or obligated."
3. **u/lonely_in_the_city**: "I feel you, OP. I'm 25 and I've been feeling the same way. I've been in a relationship for 3 years and I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck. I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want and what you're willing to work on. If you're not happy in the relationship, it's okay to admit that and move on. But don't do it just because you're feeling restless. Make sure you're doing it for the right reasons."
4. **u/foreign_exchange**: "OP, I'm a 30-year-old woman who's been in a relationship with a 25-year-old man who's from another country. We met while I was on a work visa and we've been together for 5 years. I understand how you're feeling. It's hard to balance your own desires with the needs of your partner, especially when there's a power imbalance. I think you should have a conversation with your SO about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise. Maybe there's a way to make it work, but you need to be honest with each other about what you want."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "OP, I think you're feeling trapped because you're not communicating effectively with your SO. You need to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and what you want. Don't assume that she knows what you're thinking or feeling. You need to be clear and direct about your needs and desires. And don't forget to listen to her perspective as well. Relationships are a two-way street and you need to work together to make it work."

TITLE: 14 Tillion Dollars, What Does Reaching the Debt Ceiling Really Mean?

POST: Aparently on monday the United states has reached its debt ceiling of 14 trillion dollars, and while i'd like to consider myself fairly well informed on how it got into this position of massive debt im not entirely clear on what reaching a debt ceiling means for the American economy.

Proposals from both sides of the political spectrum say that a reduction of spending is needed (with democrats proposing raising taxes in the upper braket?) but how big of a chunk of an anual budget would really be needed to put a dent in 14 trillion? You dont accumulate that kind of debt over night and i have difficulty seeing exactly how any reduction could even allow them to break even let alone start reducing this debt load given the rather large deficit administrations have been running.

And lets say for a minute that they cant figure out a way to ease off this debt ceiling, what are the consiquences for inaction? What are other means of solving this issue?

TL;DR: The US has reached its debt ceiling of 14 trillion dollars. What does this mean for the economy? How can we reduce this debt? What are the consequences if we don't?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567890**: "The debt ceiling is just a arbitrary number set by Congress. It's not like the government can't borrow more money, they just need to raise the ceiling. The real issue is the debt itself, not the ceiling. The US government has been running a deficit for decades and it's unsustainable. We need to address the underlying issues, such as entitlement reform and tax reform, to get our fiscal house in order."
2. **u/economic_nerd**: "The debt ceiling is a bit like a credit limit on your credit card. If you reach your limit, you can't borrow any more money until you pay off some of the debt or increase your limit. The problem is that the US government can't just pay off its debt like you can with a credit card. It has to issue new debt to pay off old debt, which is why the debt is growing so fast. To reduce the debt, we need to increase revenue (through taxes or other means) and reduce spending. It's not a simple problem to solve, but it's essential to get our fiscal house in order."
3. **u/conservative_liberal**: "I'm a conservative, but I think the solution to our debt problem is to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations. We need to close loopholes and make sure everyone is paying their fair share. We also need to reform entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare to make them more sustainable. And we need to invest in education and infrastructure to create jobs and grow the economy. It's not a partisan issue, it's a national issue that requires bipartisanship to solve."
4. **u/liberal_troll**: "The debt ceiling is just a tool for Republicans to hold the economy hostage and try to destroy the social safety net. They're using it as an excuse to cut vital programs and services that help the most vulnerable members of society. We need to raise the debt ceiling and then use the resulting revenue to invest in programs that benefit the many, not just the wealthy few."
5. **u/economist**: "The debt ceiling is a bit like a game of musical chairs. When the ceiling is reached, the government has to make some tough choices about which programs to cut or which taxes to raise. But the real issue is that the US government is running a structural deficit, which means that even if we make some short-term cuts, we'll still be running a deficit in the long run. We need to address the underlying drivers of the deficit, such as healthcare costs and entitlement programs, to get our fiscal house in order."

POST: My brother has a crush on a girl for at least a half year. She has start the same school as he but they don't hang out in the same groups. He does text with her on facebook and on the mobile, but he don't know any ideas for getting them to know each other better. He has been on dances and even danced with her one evening, but when he asked her if they could be together she said that she don't know him so well yet...

This issue is something that he only speaks to me about, not our mother and I will be moving to another town in a couples of weeks and I just want to help him. I'm not so good in dating tips, because I just talked with my now SO of soon 2 years one night and met him the next day and then we were together. (Short story). 

He and I live in a small village and she lives in a village maybe 15 km away. The nearest town is about 45 km away and we live in Finland. They both have only mopeds and every cinema, bowling hall etc. is in the town 45 km away (30 km from her house). He doesn't want my mother to know everything, because she's very annoying with these kinds of stuff..

TITLE: My [18 M] Ex [18 F] of 3 months says she misses me but doesn't love me. Can I start feelings again?

POST: My ex broke up with me because she lost feelings. She tells me that it was a good relationship and she wishes she didn't lose feelings but she had to do what was right and not stick around just for my sake, which I understand and am thankful she didn't. 

My Ex and I still talk almost every day, and recently I sent her a snaphat of one of 'our songs' with a funny caption. She texted me almost immediately saying that she is upset and misses me heaps, but she still has no feelings so we won't be able to date again.

My question is, how to I start those feelings up again? I miss her too and wish we didn't break up so I want to try and get her to catch feelings again but I don't know how to go about it especially when it seems like she is rejecting the idea of trying?

TL;DR: Ex broke up with me because she lost feelings. We still talk daily and she says she misses me but has no feelings. I want to try and get her to catch feelings again but don't know how.

---

**Community Response:**

**Comment 1:** "Honestly, it's not about'starting feelings again.' It's about respecting her boundaries and acknowledging that she's made her decision. If she's still in touch with you, it's likely because she values the friendship you had. Focus on nurturing that friendship and see where it takes you. Don't pressure her into rekindling romantic feelings if she's not interested."

**Comment 2:** "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to 'get her to catch feelings again.' It's not a game, and it's not something you can control. If she's not interested in rekindling the romance, it's okay to accept that and move on. You deserve someone who loves and wants to be with you, not someone who's just going through the motions."

**Comment 3:** "Have you considered that maybe she's not interested in rekindling the romance because she genuinely doesn't feel the same way? It's possible that she's being honest with you, and it's not about you or your relationship. Maybe it's time to focus on yourself and find someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."

**Comment 4:** "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. If you're still holding onto the hope of getting her back, you're not giving yourself the chance to move on and find someone who truly loves and values you. It's okay to acknowledge that the relationship is over and focus on your own happiness."

**Comment 5:** "I understand where you're coming from, but sometimes it's better to accept that some relationships just don't work out. It's not about'starting feelings again' or 'getting her to catch feelings.' It's about respecting each other's decisions and moving forward. You deserve someone who loves and wants to be with you, and it's okay to find that someone else."

TITLE: Me [27F] with my friends [20sF] of 6 years, am I just being ridiculous?

POST: Last summer I met a girl online who we'll call Jo. Jo had just moved to my city, and we met up and became friends. I introduced her to my friends and she started coming to our group get togethers.

Over the months, I started realizing that Jo was extremely high maintenance and controlling. I felt like every few weeks she would be angry at me about something trivial.

The final straw was when I offered to introduce her to one of my single guy friends. She asked me to find out if he was interested. Unfortunately he was not, and when I told her this she took it out on me like it was somehow my fault. That was the final straw. I felt like our friendship was toxic and told her that she was too demanding and I couldn't be friends anymore. This was about three weeks ago.

I didn't tell any of my friends in the group (except for one because I sought her advice) because I didn't know what to do. Now I feel like she's doubled how much she's hanging out with my friends and I am going to run into her this weekend.

R/Relationships, please give me a reality check here. Is it completely wrong of me to tell my friends what happened? I feel bad putting them in a position to choose, but on the other hand I have been friends with all of them for years and want their support. I don't really know what to do. I've never been in this situation before.

TL;DR: I ended a toxic friendship with a girl I met online, but now I'm worried about how to tell my friends about it and if I'm being ridiculous for feeling this way.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide a reality check and offer helpful advice. The OP is struggling with feelings of guilt and uncertainty about how to handle the situation, and the community responds with empathy and guidance.

Some of the top comments include:

* "You're not being ridiculous for feeling this way. You ended a toxic friendship and that's a big deal. It's okay to feel uncertain about how to handle it, but don't beat yourself up over it."
* "It's not your responsibility to protect Jo's feelings or to keep the friendship a secret. You did what was best for yourself and that's something to be proud of."
* "It's okay to tell your friends what happened. They're your friends and they care about you. They'll likely be supportive and understanding. Just be honest and open with them about your feelings and what happened."

The community also offers some practical advice, such as:

* "Consider having a conversation with your friends before you run into Jo this weekend. Let them know what happened and how you're feeling. This way, you can all be on the same page and support each other."
* "Remember that you don't owe Jo an explanation or an apology. You did what was best for yourself and that's all that matters."

Overall, the r/relationships community provides a safe and supportive space for the OP to share their concerns and receive helpful advice and guidance. The community's responses are empathetic, non-judgmental, and practical, and help the OP to feel more confident and empowered in their decision to end the toxic friendship.

TITLE: How do I (20M) become ok with my GF (20F) texting other guys

POST: We've been dating for almost two years. My GF will often have 2-3 guys she is "texting" at a time. I assume they are all harmless convos but I cant get the worst case scenarios out of my mind like she is cheating on me with these guys or something. She says they are just friends but it doesnt ease my mind much. And I know she doesnt mean any harm by it. She's an attention craver. I think it stems back to daddy issues since she didnt grow up with a dad or much attention as a child. Anyway the problem is that sometimes she'll receive a text and I know its from one of these guys. I feel like this shouldnt be a big issue but I have a lot of insecurities when it comes to girls texting other guys. Ive had bad relationship exprriences with this in the past. Anyway my first instinct is to badger her about it. Asking things like, "whos that?" or "is that a guy?". Its just the way I am to be nosy like that but its not good. Any time I ask she gets really defensive and irritated that I ask so many questions and feels like I dont trust her. I know that me being like this is only hurting my relationship. 

How do I get over these insecurities and stop being so nosy?

Is this normal?

Do I have a right to ask these questions? 

Thanks!

TL;DR: My GF texts other guys and it makes me insecure. I feel like I should be able to trust her but I cant help but wonder if she's cheating. I don't want to be nosy but I feel like I have a right to know who she's texting. How do I get over these insecurities and stop being so nosy?

It's normal to feel insecure, but it's not healthy to assume the worst about your partner. Have an open and honest conversation with your GF about how you're feeling. Ask her to explain the context of these texts and why she feels the need to have multiple 'friendships' going on. It's possible she's not cheating, but even if she is, it's not the end of the world. You can work through it together or decide it's not worth it. But don't assume the worst without giving her a chance to explain herself."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're misunderstanding the concept of 'friendship' in this context. Just because someone is texting your GF doesn't mean they're a romantic interest. It's possible she's just being friendly and social. Instead of focusing on who she's texting, try to focus on the quality of your relationship with her. Are you happy? Do you feel supported and loved? If so, then maybe it's not worth worrying about who she's texting. And if you're not happy, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
3. **u/infidelity**: "I'm not saying it's okay to cheat, but it's also not okay to assume the worst about your partner without evidence. If you're feeling insecure, try to address the root cause of those feelings instead of jumping to conclusions. Have a conversation with your GF about how you're feeling and see if you can work through it together. And if you do find out she's cheating, it's not the end of the world. You can work through it or decide it's not worth it. But don't assume the worst without giving her a chance to explain herself."
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're being a bit too controlling. It's not your job to police your GF's phone or dictate who she can and can't talk to. If you're feeling insecure, try to focus on building trust and communication in your relationship instead of trying to control every aspect of it. And if you do find out she's cheating, it's not the end of the world. You can work through it or decide it's not worth it. But don't assume the worst without giving her a chance to explain herself."

**Common themes:**

* The importance of open and honest communication in relationships
* The need to address underlying insecurities and fears rather than jumping to conclusions
* The possibility that the texts may not be romantic in nature, but rather friendly or social
* The importance of trust and communication in building a healthy relationship
* The need to avoid assuming the worst without evidence and to give the partner a chance to explain themselves.

TITLE: Should I[f21] tell my parents that my SO[m22] is traveling across the Atlantic to visit me while I'm in Europe?

POST: My parents are Indian, and though they are fairly open-minded with most topics, they don't approve of my white boyfriend who I've been dating for almost 2 years (I told them about him 1 year ago). I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more'serious'? I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama. But is this a cop-out?

TL;DR: My SO is coming to visit me in Europe, but my parents won't approve of him due to his race. Should I tell them or keep it a secret?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Honestly, it's not fair to keep this from your parents. They have a right to know what's going on in your life, even if they don't approve. You can't keep secrets from them forever. Just be honest and have an open conversation with them. It might be uncomfortable, but it's better to be upfront.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: I understand your concerns, but it's not about keeping secrets or not. It's about being honest with your parents and having a conversation about your relationship. You can explain to them that you're not getting'serious' and that this is just a visit. Maybe they'll surprise you and be more open-minded than you think.
3. **u/indianmom**: As an Indian mom myself, I can tell you that it's not about the race, it's about the values and traditions we hold dear. If your parents are concerned about your relationship, it's because they want what's best for you. Have an open conversation with them and listen to their concerns. You might be surprised at how much they understand and support you.
4. **u/neutralobserver**: Why are you so worried about what your parents think? You're an adult, and you can make your own decisions. If you're happy with your SO, then that's all that matters. Don't let your parents dictate your life. Just enjoy your time with your SO and don't worry about what they think.
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with your parents and explain the situation. They might be more open-minded than you think. And if they're not, then that's their problem, not yours. You do what makes you happy, and that's what matters.

---

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post highlight the complexity of the situation. Some users suggest being honest with parents and having an open conversation, while others advise not worrying about what they think and doing what makes you happy. Ultimately, the decision to tell or not tell parents about the visit depends on the individual's relationship with their parents and their own values and priorities. The post's author may want to consider the potential consequences of keeping the visit a secret and weigh them against the potential benefits of being honest with their parents.

TITLE: I [22F] need advice about my sister [20F], depressed college drop out furry.

POST: Last week my sister told me that is now a furry. 

My sister dropped out of university after one semester two years ago. She's been living with my parents since then. She goes to a community college, but she has failed most of her classes there. She has almost no friends, and she spends most of her time alone in her room. She is very into anime, cosplay, MLP, and is now making a 'fursuit'. I'm very concerned about her. She seems to have no goals, dreams, or ambition and she keeps falling into weirder and weirder crowds. I've suggested that my parents kick her out into a student apartment, so that she will be surrounded by other girls her age. 

She will be 21 soon, on her way to adulthood, and she has shown no sign of growing up. She finally got her first minimum wage job about a month ago. My parents have saved up around 20K for her college fund, so she has the resources to go to college, but she cannot seem to pass her classes. She began taking Vyvanse for ADHD a few months ago, but I do not know if that has made any improvement. She has had boyfriends, but every one of them has been jealous and abusive.

She had an extremely abusive boyfriend a few years ago, who apparently beat and raped her before my parents got her out of that relationship. She has been in counseling because of that, and was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. I'm sitting here with my Mom and we're pretty much at a loss here on how to handle this.

TL;DR: My sister, 20F, dropped out of college, has no friends, and is now into furries. She's been living with our parents, has ADHD and PTSD, and has a history of abusive relationships. I'm worried about her future and don't know how to help her.

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like your sister is struggling with a lot of issues. It's great that you're concerned about her and want to help. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor together? They could help you both understand what's going on and develop a plan to support her."
* "I think it's great that your sister is finding something that makes her happy, even if it's not what you would have chosen for her. It's important to support her and not judge her for her choices. Maybe you could try to learn more about the furry community and what it means to your sister. It might help you understand her better and find ways to connect with her."
* "I'm not sure I agree with your suggestion to kick her out of the house. It sounds like she's still struggling to cope with her past traumas and may not be ready to be on her own yet. Maybe you could try to support her in finding ways to manage her anxiety and depression, and help her develop some coping skills. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor together to get some guidance on how to do this."
* "I think it's great that your sister is taking Vyvanse for her ADHD. It's a common medication that can really help people with ADHD focus and stay organized. Have you talked to her doctor about how it's working for her? Maybe you could also try to help her find some other ways to manage her ADHD, like exercise or meditation. It might help her feel more in control of her life."
* "I'm so sorry to hear that your sister has been in abusive relationships. That must be really tough for her. It's great that she's in counseling and getting help for her PTSD. Maybe you could try to support her in finding ways to heal and move forward from her past traumas. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor together to get some guidance on how to do this."

TITLE: My [22 F] father [47 M] just told me he is dating someone my older sister's [25 F] age. Feeling conflicted with the information.

POST: My parents are separated and have been for going on three years. My mom moved away and I still live with my dad while I finish University. 

My dad has been seeing someone and when this person comes over he asks me to not be at the house. The other day, after a few nights of this, he told me the reason that I couldn't be there was that the girl he is seeing is 25 and she thought I would judge her.

 I feel like I have been put in a very awkward position because my older and younger sister don't know about it. I want to talk to them but I also don't want to tell them because I would have honestly preferred not knowing about it.

TL;DR: My dad is dating someone my older sister's age and I'm feeling conflicted about it. I don't know if I should tell my sisters or not.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not your place to tell your sisters about your dad's personal life. If he wants to share it with them, he will. You don't have to feel guilty about not telling them, but you also don't have to lie to them if they ask. Just be honest and say you don't know anything about it."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should have a conversation with your dad about how you're feeling. He might not have realized how awkward this is for you. Maybe he'll understand your perspective and you can work together to figure out how to handle the situation."
3. **concerned_citizen**: "I think you should tell your sisters. They have a right to know what's going on in their family. Your dad might not have thought this through and your sisters might be upset or even hurt if they find out from someone else. It's better to be honest and open with them."
4. **neutral_nancy**: "I think you should take some time to think about how you feel and what you want to do. It's not an easy situation, but you don't have to make a decision right away. You can always talk to a trusted friend or family member for advice."
5. **empathetic_emily**: "I can understand why you're feeling conflicted. It's a weird situation. But remember that your dad is an adult and he can make his own decisions. If he's happy with this person, that's all that matters. You don't have to agree with it, but you can still be supportive of him. Just be honest with your sisters if they ask and move forward from there."



**Analysis:**

The post is about a 22-year-old woman who is feeling conflicted about her father's new relationship with a 25-year-old woman, who is the same age as her older sister. The OP is unsure whether to tell her sisters about the situation or not.

The comments are varied, with some people advising the OP to keep the information to herself, while others suggest that she should tell her sisters. Some comments also suggest that the OP should have a conversation with her dad about how she's feeling.

The most common themes in the comments are:

* The importance of honesty and openness in relationships
* The need to respect the OP's feelings and boundaries
* The complexity of the situation and the need for careful consideration before making a decision

Overall, the comments provide a range of perspectives and advice, but ultimately, the decision of what to do is up to the OP.

TITLE: Me [20 M] broke up with my SO [19 F] of 3 years a month or two ago.... Where do i even start to rebuild my social life and look for new relationships?

POST: I poured all my time into her and my hobbies, i have a few friends online that have moved far away and no one in person currently to spend time with at all. I don't know how to meet new people currently. I'm fixing to be going into Bartending but i don't necessarily want to meet people at my job... Where do I begin? Its at the point that i might be ready to start dating again, but i'm not sure where to start with that either... 

I'm quite the nerd and enjoy lots of stuff other people would think is geeky or nerdy so this MIGHT be a factor to consider.

TL;DR: Broke up with SO, no friends in person, no idea how to meet new people, and unsure where to start with dating again. Help!

---

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm in a similar situation. I broke up with my SO about 6 months ago and was struggling to rebuild my social life. I started by joining a few online communities related to my hobbies (gaming, in my case). It was a great way to connect with like-minded people and make some new friends. I also started taking classes or workshops in things I'm interested in, like photography or cooking. This way, I met new people who shared my passions. As for dating, I'd say take your time and focus on yourself for a bit. When you're ready, try online dating or ask friends to set you up. And don't be afraid to be yourself – being a nerd is awesome, and there are plenty of people out there who will appreciate your quirks!"
2. **u/nerdalert99**: "OP, I'm a fellow nerd and I totally get where you're coming from. I'd recommend checking out local gaming groups, comic book stores, or book clubs in your area. These are great ways to meet people who share your interests. You can also try attending conventions or festivals related to your hobbies. As for dating, I'd say be open-minded and don't be too hard on yourself. You might be surprised at how many people are into the same things as you. And hey, being a nerd is awesome – it's a great way to connect with others who share your passions!"
3. **u/socialbutterfly123**: "OP, I'm not a nerd myself, but I've always been fascinated by the community. I'd recommend trying to find a local meetup group or club that aligns with your interests. This way, you can meet new people who share your passions and hobbies. You can also try attending events or gatherings related to your interests. As for dating, I'd say take your time and focus on yourself for a bit. When you're ready, try online dating or ask friends to set you up. And don't be afraid to be yourself – being a nerd is awesome, and there are plenty of people out there who will appreciate your quirks!"

**Common themes:**

* Attending events or gatherings related to your interests
* Being open-minded and not being too hard on yourself when it comes to dating

TITLE: Me [21F] with my almost-boyfriend?[25M] met at one night stand, been seeing for a week, great guy, scared of him drifting away

POST: Been with this guy for a week. Knew him previously, but didn't really talk. We both got it on at a party, now we're seeing each other, kind of. Still extremely fresh. Since then we've hung out a couple of times, at the beach, and talked for hours. I'm actually starting to really like this guy and want to be with him and get to know him better. He's got a business trip for 10 days as of tomorrow though, so we won't be able to hang out. Should I say anything? Should I text him much? He has been the one taking me places for us to hang out and stuff but I don't want to seem clingy or annoying, it's one of my peeves actually. We text a couple of times a day and he always responds with really long texts.

I had a bad experience a few years ago and am still a bit scarred mentally. When I was with him today we were quite intimate with hugging and kissing and I'm scared I came off as "awkward". So I told him very superficially what happened in the past. He just looked at me for a long time and gave me a long hug.

I'm scared to scare him away, nobody seems to give me long enough for me to "open up" and get totally comfortable with. And this guy is really worth it. I know it's super early yet, but I want to give it my all, and I'm scared he'll drift away because of how I might act or whatever.

TL;DR: Been seeing this guy for a week, great guy, but scared of drifting away. He's going on a 10-day trip, should I say anything? Should I text him much? I'm scared of coming off as clingy or awkward.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's normal to feel scared and unsure in a new relationship. But it sounds like this guy is really into you and is making an effort to get to know you better. Just be yourself and don't overthink it too much. If he's worth it, he'll understand and appreciate your vulnerability."
* "I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You're not being clingy or awkward, you're just being honest and open. That's a great quality to have in a partner. Just relax and enjoy the ride. And don't worry too much about the trip, he'll be back before you know it."
* "I think you should talk to him about your concerns. It's better to be open and honest about how you're feeling than to assume the worst. You can say something like 'Hey, I'm feeling a little anxious about our relationship and the fact that you're going away for 10 days. Can we make a plan to stay in touch and catch up when you get back?'"
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're still getting to know each other, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Just enjoy the time you have together and don't worry too much about the future. You can always reassess things when he gets back."
* "I think you should focus on building a connection with him instead of worrying about the future. What are some things you have in common? What do you like to do together? Focus on those things and let the rest fall into place."

Overall, the comments are encouraging and reassuring, with many people suggesting that the OP should focus on building a connection with the guy and not worry too much about the future. Some people also suggest talking to him about their concerns and being open and honest about how they're feeling. Only a few people mention the possibility of him drifting away, but most people seem to think that if he's worth it, he'll understand and appreciate the OP's vulnerability.

TITLE: Dont know if I [M,24] should end it with my gf[F,23]

POST: My gf works at reception in an hotel, so she only has 1 day off work. This week they gave wednesday and she went with Two friends [m,f] to some restaurant/bar, afterwards she went with them to his friend apartment.

Then they started to smoke weed and she tells me she got uncomfortable and left because she has never tried it. She was previously drinking and it was 5am, so she wasn't in her best condition. so after some time of walking and looking for a cab she was stranded in an unknown place, maybe not that secure. 

She called me but I was half sleep and we weren't speaking for some previous discussion. I didn't say much and she didn't told me what was happening but her voice sounded like she was sobbing.  Anyway, the following day she calls and tells me that same story but that she called his ex bf because she panicked, and he picked her up and left her in her flat. she says they didn't do anything, that he just gave her a ride to her flat.

We been dating for 5 months and been together as a couple for 7; I think we have a good honest relationship, sometimes we argue but after a few days we are ok and have a great time together. Also his exbf is sort of a douchebag and previously cheated on her, and uses coke so not really a trustworthy person.

TL;DR: GF goes out with friends, gets drunk, tries weed, gets uncomfortable, leaves, gets stranded, calls me, I don't answer, she calls exbf for help, he gives her a ride home.

QUESTION: Should I end it with my girlfriend? I feel like she's not respecting me or our relationship. She didn't tell me the truth about what happened and she called her exbf for help instead of me. I feel like she's not prioritizing our relationship and I don't know if I can trust her anymore.

COMMENT 1:
Dude, I get why you're upset, but maybe take a step back and think about why she did what she did. She was in a situation where she was uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. She didn't call you because she was half asleep and didn't want to wake you up. And yeah, she shouldn't have called her exbf, but maybe she was just desperate and didn't know who else to turn to.

Also, have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's not even aware of how her actions have affected you. Communication is key in any relationship, so maybe try to have a calm and honest conversation with her about what's going on.

COMMENT 2:
I agree with the first commenter. It sounds like your girlfriend was in a tough spot and made some mistakes. But instead of jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst, maybe try to understand what was going through her mind.

And yeah, she shouldn't have called her exbf, but maybe she was just trying to get out of a bad situation. And who knows, maybe he was just being a good friend and gave her a ride home.

I think you should try to talk to her about this and see what she has to say. Maybe she's willing to work through this and come out stronger on the other side. But if you're not willing to listen and understand her perspective, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship.

COMMENT 3:
I'm gonna be honest with you, dude. Your girlfriend sounds like she's got some major trust issues. She's not being honest with you, she's calling her exbf for help instead of you, and she's putting herself in situations that are clearly not good for her.

I don't know if you're willing to put in the work to help her work through these issues, but if you're not, then maybe it's time to move on. You deserve better than someone who's not going to prioritize your relationship and your feelings.

COMMENT 4:
I think you're being a bit harsh, OP. Your girlfriend made some mistakes, but she's also shown that she's willing to work through them and communicate with you. Maybe try to have a calm and honest conversation with her about what's going on and see where it takes you.

And yeah, her exbf is a bit of a sketchball, but maybe she's just trying to move on from the past and not dwell on the negative. Who knows, maybe she's even trying to prove to herself that she can move on and be happy without him.

I think you should try to be understanding and supportive, and see if you can work through this together. But if you're not willing to listen and understand her perspective, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship.

TITLE: Thinking about therapy, implications for employment? Specifically: Peace Corps.

POST: I've been thinking about seeking some type of therapy (most likely CBT) for awhile now to help me deal with some social anxiety and negative thinking issues for some time. I've never done this sort of thing before and while I think I'm doing pretty well in bettering myself on my own, I'd like to make more progress and get an outside opinion on some things.

My concern is that if I seek therapy, and use my insurance to help pay for it, that this information could somehow be used against me when looking for employment. I just submitted an application to the Peace Corps and as part of that application it asked if I had ever seen a psychologist and if so, the date I saw them last. I answered no, which is true, but if I now go see a therapist and don't tell them, then I'm likely breaking rules that if they found out, could lead to my termination (and I guess possibly fines/jail).

Is there any way for them to find this out if I don't tell them? I really feel that it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them and I don't want it to influence my chances. Thanks!

TL;DR: Considering therapy, concerned about potential implications for employment with the Peace Corps. Is there a way for them to find out if I don't disclose my therapy sessions?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Disclose, disclose, disclose**: It's generally recommended to be honest and upfront about any therapy sessions or mental health issues when applying for employment, especially for government agencies like the Peace Corps. Lying or withholding information can lead to termination, even if you're not currently receiving therapy.
* **Check the application**: Review the Peace Corps application carefully and make sure you understand what they're asking. If you're unsure, you can always contact their HR department to clarify.
* **Consider a brief, honest answer**: Instead of saying "no" to the question, you could answer something like, "I've been considering seeking therapy to address some personal issues, but I haven't started yet." This shows that you're proactive about your mental health and willing to be honest.
* **It's not a personal issue**: While it may feel like a personal issue, your mental health is relevant to your ability to perform your duties as a Peace Corps volunteer. The Peace Corps is committed to supporting the mental health and well-being of its volunteers, and disclosing your therapy sessions can actually be a positive factor in your application.
* **Don't worry about the stigma**: Many people seek therapy, and it's not a reflection of your character or abilities. You shouldn't feel ashamed or embarrassed about seeking help for your mental health.

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:**

* The Peace Corps' Mental Health and Wellness webpage
* The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) website
* The American Psychological Association (APA) website

Remember, honesty is usually the best policy when it comes to employment applications. If you're unsure about what to do, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for guidance. Good luck with your application and your therapy journey!

TITLE: Me [21 F] and my boyfriend [20M] for almost 2 years, broke up due to long distance; left it in a bad place

POST: We were together for almost 2 years at uni, and we even lived together. But I moved across the world for a year abroad of uni, and after about 3 months the strain became too much. 

We mutually broke up, and we were both  ok. But afterwards I didn't take it well; I drunkenly text and rang him. So I decided to delete him off facebook to stop myself from embarrassing myself further. 

This didn't really work, and the last time we talked was when I tried to call sober to clear the air but he was angry that I was contacting him again. He said we'd talk in a few months when I was over it but I told him I didn't want to be friends.

That was a few weeks ago and I don't know what to do. I feel so awful that I have lost not only my boyfriend but my best friend, and the idea that we can't even be friends really saddens me. I know I was in the wrong and I was so over dramatic, but I feel this is mostly to do with the fact I'm not really enjoying my time abroad.

I kind of wish I'd never left my home country and him, I was happy there. I don't know what I expected to find here but I haven't.
Should I just leave this and move on?

TL;DR: Me and my ex bf broke up due to long distance, I didn't take it well and we're not on good terms. I'm feeling awful and regretful, and I don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling so awful. Is it really just the breakup, or is it the fact that you're not enjoying your time abroad? Maybe you're feeling lost and unsure of what you want. Take some time to figure that out before trying to rekindle things with your ex."
* "I think you should try to focus on the positive aspects of your life right now. You're abroad, you're experiencing new things, and you're growing as a person. Don't let the breakup define your time here. You deserve to be happy, and maybe this is an opportunity for you to find that happiness without your ex."
* "I think you should try to communicate with your ex again, but not in a way that's going to lead to more drama. Maybe send him a calm, rational message saying that you're sorry for your behavior and that you're trying to move on. Who knows, he might be willing to talk and work through things. But don't expect him to be all apologetic and forgiving if you're not willing to do the same."
* "I think you should just leave this and move on. You're not going to get closure or a happy ending with your ex. You deserve better than that. You deserve someone who loves and respects you for who you are, and that's not your ex. Take this as an opportunity to focus on yourself and find someone who truly cares about you."
* "I think you should try to find a way to forgive yourself. You were hurt and you acted out, but that doesn't mean you're a bad person. You're human, and humans make mistakes. Try to be kind to yourself and focus on moving forward. You don't have to be friends with your ex, but you can still learn to forgive yourself and move on."

TITLE: Me[18M/F] with my ___ [18M/F] duration, short-description

POST: [Previous Post](

---

So I snooped again because I saw a text pop up from him last week on her phone.

Last Saturday night, she texted him out of the blue just before 10pm saying "what u up to tonight?". This is a week after he last texted her and she didn't respond. This was in a 20 min gap when she wasn't with me. She was drunk too.

She then met up with me shortly after at 10pm so didn't respond to any of his texts for the rest of the night/she got too drunk to function and I had to take her home.

The rest of his texts were about asking her to meet up etc with last text being at 1am. This is when I saw the text as I was still up and her phone was on the table. I decided not to snoop further at that stage.

She hasn't text back since then.

I know all of this because I only decided to snoop last night because it's been bugging me ever since. She got blind drunk last night so I had to meet up with my mate and her on the street and help her get home. She was in memory blank drunk mode. On a work night too. Which just made me think wtf is going on with her so I snooped when she was passed out.

Also remembered something she said to me a few weeks ago, she said

"I used to text other guys when I was with my past boyfriends, because basically I got bored, but with you I don't have to because you're so fun" or something like that.

And ever since she said that it's been in the back of my mind, contributing to my insecurity, and has me thinking oh is this the start of this sort of behavior.

I think you guys are right that I don't trust. And I have to admit it too. I don't trust her that much at the moment due to her behavior and my insecurities.

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 6 months has been texting an old friend of hers, a guy, and I found out because I saw a text on her phone. She hasn't responded to his texts since then. She's been acting weird and I'm feeling insecure.

---

**Edit:** I've been in a relationship with her for 6 months now, and we've had our ups and downs. I've always been a bit insecure, but this has really triggered something in me. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing what she's going to do or say. I've tried talking to her about it, but she just brushes it off and tells me I'm being paranoid. I don't know what to do. I love her, but I feel like I'm losing myself in this relationship.

**Edit 2:** I just wanted to add that I've been doing some research on toxic relationships and I think I might be in one. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to her, and she's always making me feel guilty for something. I don't know if I can keep going like this. Help.

TITLE: TIFU by zoning out and burning myself

POST: This fuck up happened less than 30 minutes ago... do I get a prize?

Background: I am a high school student and I generally pride myself for being part of the upper group as far as intelligence is concerned, but after my fuck up, I have been considerably humbled. 

The Fuck Up: I was in chemistry today and we were doing a lab. In this particular lab we were using a little bowl called a crucible.  The crucible was still wet after being washed at the end of the last class, therefore the first instruction was to heat it over a burner to dry it out. 

We heated the crucible for the required two minutes and sat it at the table to cool, as it was cooling I began to read the instructions for the next step, which required us to find its  mass. My mind had begun to wander from the lab, when I remembered what needed to be done. I promptly said "Let me just mass this." I grabbed the crucible. The blazing hot, just heated by fire for two minutes crucible. It burned, seeking to remove it from my hand and stop the pain. I flung it to the ground and it shattered. 

The looks I received from my teacher and the other students were those of bewilderment. They were bewildered at how I could be so stupid as to grab an incredibly hot crucible. I am shamed, and my burned finger hurts.

TL;DR: I grabbed a hot crucible, burned myself, and shattered it. I am a genius, but I guess not that genius.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

1. "Well, at least you learned a valuable lesson: never grab a hot crucible. And also, never zone out in class."
2. "I'm surprised you didn't set off the fire alarm. That's a good way to get out of class, I guess."
3. "You know what they say: 'a genius is someone who can make the same mistake over and over again.'"
4. "I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that you burned yourself or the fact that you managed to write a coherent post about it."
5. "You should consider a career in comedy. That's a great story."
6. "I'm pretty sure that's not the first time someone has done that. But hey, at least you're owning up to it."
7. "I'm not sure what's more embarrassing, the fact that you burned yourself or the fact that you're sharing it on the internet."
8. "You know, it's not the end of the world. You can always get a new crucible. And a new finger."
9. "I'm pretty sure that's a record for most creative way to get out of doing homework."
10. "You should start a support group for people who have burned themselves in chemistry class. I'm sure you'd have a lot of members."

TITLE: How do i not screw this one up?

POST: **Backstory:** im in my second year of college, i've been known to go out and sleep with a lot of girls.. not really my idea of a good night or anything, but it just kind of happens. havn't really had any real dating experience since freshman year of highschool, 4 girlfriends total, all cheated with close friends, i now have some trust issues, and generally just have sex with people (i have numerous fwb) 

**The Situation** so few weekends ago, at the usual bar with a couple of pals, my usual buddies but with some more people from our program. get to dancing with one of the girls, start flirting, figured id try and make a move, but kept being interrupted and she ended up getting really drunk and leaving, but afterwords she added me to facebook and started chatting. girls really cool, valentines day she texts me pretty upset, the guy shes screwing around with told her shes a side chick, ( something i to myself would probably do), so i comforted her, cheered her up abit, got to shooting shit. get the stones to ask her to come watch a movie, she comes over we cuddle for abit, chat all night, and she leaves, we've watched movies and cuddled every night since. 

**Where im at right now** ive told all of my fwb that its over, i genuinely do not wanna hurt this girl, and i have feelings for her.she just left from our "first date" i made her supper, we watched a movie, cuddled, she wants things to go slow because shes weary. but im falling hard.. 

**The Question**soo.. what can i do to help further this, without seeming desperate and overly attached, because with her its not even for sex, i just want her around 24/7.. 

Sorry that this got so long..

TL;DR: I've had a string of casual relationships and am now developing feelings for a girl who's also wary of commitment. I want to take things slow and not seem desperate, but I'm falling hard. What can I do to further this relationship without freaking her out?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're already falling hard and you're worried about seeming desperate? Just be honest with her. Tell her how you're feeling and see how she responds. If she's not feeling the same way, then at least you'll know and can move on. But if she is feeling the same way, then you can start building a real connection."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I think you're getting ahead of yourself. You've only been on a few dates and you're already talking about wanting to be with her 24/7. Take it slow, focus on getting to know her as a person, and see if your feelings are mutual. Don't put pressure on her to reciprocate your feelings, just enjoy the process and see where it takes you."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I'm not sure I buy the 'I just want her around 24/7' thing. That sounds like a classic sign of attachment issues. You need to work on yourself before you can have a healthy relationship with someone else. Take some time to reflect on why you're feeling this way and see if you can identify any patterns or triggers."
4. **CasualObserver**: "I think you're making a big mistake by telling all your fwb that it's over. You're essentially cutting off your options and putting all your eggs in one basket. What if things don't work out with this girl? You're left with nothing. Keep your options open and don't put too much pressure on this relationship."
5. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: "I think you should be honest with her about your past and your feelings. Don't try to sugarcoat it or hide it. If she's not comfortable with it, then that's okay. At least you'll know where you stand. But if she is comfortable with it, then you can start building a real connection and working through any issues that come up."

TITLE: My[26M] fiancée [27F] is upset I stayed out late after a concert, I think she is over reacting.

POST: I am in a long distance relationship with my fiancée. I really like concerts, and go often. I went to a concert on Friday night, and meet an adorable couple at the show. We really hit it off with them. I liked him a lot, he was really cool, and she was really sweet/precious. We ended up staying out till 5 am and had a blast.

I normally text her when I am home, but apparently I passed out without properly hitting the button. (The message was all typed out and everything.) When I woke up at 9, I apologized for not texting her, because I know she wants me to be safe.

Last night, she basically said I was stupid and unsafe for doing what I did. I didn't know them, and I was not being smart. I told her that I really trusted them, and that they were harmless. She said she didn't care.

I have traveled the world. I have been to over 20 countries and backpacked with strangers for weeks, in the mountains. This makes me nervous that she thinks this was so dangerous, as this seems like such a small thing to me.

Am I thinking about this wrongly?

TL;DR: I went to a concert, met some cool people, and stayed out late. My fiancée is upset and thinks I was stupid and unsafe. I think she is overreacting.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're 26, your fiancée is 27, and you're acting like a 16-year-old who got caught sneaking out of the house. Grow up and take responsibility for your actions."
* "You're right, it's not a big deal, but it's not about the concert or the people you met. It's about respecting your partner's feelings and boundaries. You should have communicated with her and let her know what was going on."
* "You're a world traveler, but that doesn't mean you're immune to making mistakes. You should have been more considerate of your partner's concerns and apologized sincerely."
* "It sounds like your fiancée is feeling insecure and anxious about your safety. You need to have a conversation with her about her feelings and work on building trust."
* "You're not thinking about this wrongly, but you are being selfish. You need to consider your partner's perspective and find a compromise."

**Conclusion:**

The OP's fiancée is upset because she feels insecure and anxious about his safety, and he is not taking her concerns seriously. The OP needs to have a conversation with his fiancée about her feelings and work on building trust. He should also apologize sincerely and take responsibility for his actions. The OP's commenters are right, it's not about the concert or the people he met, it's about respecting his partner's feelings and boundaries. The OP needs to grow up and take responsibility for his actions.

TITLE: Me [20m] and my ex [20f] broke up due to her parents beliefs.

POST: This had been going on most of our relationship (6 months) but her parents go to a Church of Christ and long story short, if I'm not on par with their religion, then I'm not allowed to date her. They've met me once and didn't see that I was good enough so it wasn't allowed no matter what she tried telling them.  She's suffocated by them and doesn't know where she is on religion due to them forcing it on her. She definitely doesn't agree with a lot of their beliefs. 

We have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for 6 months, and I still have that feeling I got the the first week we dated. Now she broke up with me because we have been hiding it the whole time and she started getting frustrated with lying and being scared of them figuring out because the consequences would be pretty great.

Neither her or I are in the position to move out so options on how this could work are very limited. Talking to them really isn't going to do anything because they're so deep in religion, that there's no if, ands, or buts. We're in a rough spot and are both really stressed out and would like to be together but them finding out would not be pretty. Does anyone have an suggestions or experience with this? It'd be MUCH appreciated as I'm very upset and just want this all better.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Ex and I broke up due to her parents' beliefs about dating outside of their religion. We're both stressed and want to be together but her parents would not approve. We're stuck and don't know what to do.

COMMENTS:

* "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about this? They may be able to help you both work through your feelings and come up with a plan that works for you both."
* "I can understand why she would feel suffocated by her parents' beliefs. It's not fair that they're dictating who she can and can't date. Have you considered talking to her about what she wants to do? Does she want to try to find a way to make it work with her parents or does she want to take a stand and do what's best for her?"
* "I'm not sure what the solution is, but I do know that it's not fair to either of you. You both deserve to be happy and make your own decisions about who you want to be with. Maybe you could try to find a compromise, like meeting with her parents and having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and beliefs?"
* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered talking to a lawyer about your rights and options? You may be able to find a way to make it work without having to move out or give up your relationship."
* "I can understand why you're upset, but I have to say that I'm a bit surprised that you're still holding onto the hope of being with her. It sounds like her parents are pretty entrenched in their beliefs and it's not going to be easy to change their minds. Maybe it's time to focus on moving on and finding someone who is more accepting of you and your beliefs?"

These comments offer a range of advice and perspectives, from talking to a therapist or counselor to finding a compromise with her parents to considering legal options. Some comments are more sympathetic and understanding, while others are more critical and suggest that the OP should move on. Overall, the comments reflect a mix of empathy and practical advice, with some people offering more emotional support and others providing more concrete suggestions for how to navigate the situation.

TITLE: [m24] currently dating a very young girl

POST: Currently I'm in a pretty good relationship with a girl who is younger than the "half your age plus 7" rule. Actually she has just hit the age of consent (16) and we have been dating pretty seriously for 5 months. Honestly I felt pretty bad about it in the beginning because when I was younger I always despised older guys dating really young girls. Now I have become what I once hated.... 

I truly felt when I was going to first meet her Chris Hansen was going to show up with some cameras.

But no, we have not had any sexual relations yet. However, I can honestly say I do like her for much more than that. She is much more mature,  honest and straight forward than other girls my age, which I find really attractive.

She has also told me her mother met her dad at the age of 15, married 5 years later and were happy ever since. This gives me some kind of hope.

Do Parents Know?: Currently her mother is only aware that we "talking" but not the depth of the relationship. I know her mother personally since she is a friend of the family. However, I have not introduced myself as her daughter's companion yet. I would rather do the whole meet and greet the family when she turns 18.

I'm wondering if there are currently any other redditors out there that have had a similar (successful) experience?

TL;DR: I'm 24 and dating a 16-year-old girl. We've been together for 5 months and I'm worried about what her parents will think when they find out. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

TITLE: What's the most disturbing thing you've ever seen or experienced?

POST: I was 16 and dating a 24-year-old guy. We were at his place and his friends were over. I was feeling really uncomfortable and wanted to leave, but he convinced me to stay and have a good time. Next thing I know, he's pulling out a camera and telling me to pose for some "fun" photos. I was mortified. He told me it was just for his friends to see and that I was being silly for being so upset.

I didn't know what to do, so I just went along with it. But looking back, it was a really scary and violating experience. I felt so powerless and trapped. I eventually got out of there and never spoke to him again.

I'm just glad I was able to get out of that situation, but it's still a really disturbing memory for me. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience?

The thing is, her parents don't know about us yet. I'm worried about how they'll react when they find out. I've been thinking about telling them, but I'm not sure if it's the right time.

I know some people might think I'm a creep for dating someone so much younger, but I genuinely care about her and I think we have a real connection.

TITLE: I [20/F] with my boyfriend [20 M] of 1.5 yrs, want to end things now during long distance though we'll be in the same city in two months.

POST: I have been dating a guy for about year and a half. I have been having feelings toward ending the relationship for some time now (and I've mentioned this to him). We are currently in different cities for the summer but we'll be in the same city by September (where we both attend school). I'm sure the physical distance between us now hasn't helped, but we visited each other recently and I didn't feel the spark that i used to. Is it terrible to end it during long distance when we'll be seeing each other again so soon? Do i wait and give it a chance to be saved when we get back? We are starting to feel like only friends. 
I know he does not want to end things. I feel stuck. I've met someone in this city whose sparked my interest. I feel guilty, but mentally this relationship has felt distant to me for some time.

Not sure if I should wait, doing it in person is usually suggested, or bite the bullet and do it now.

TL;DR: I'm 20F, been dating 20M for 1.5 yrs, feeling distant and want to end it. We're in different cities but will be in same city in 2 months. Should I wait or end it now?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not terrible to end it during long distance. You've had time to think about it, and you've mentioned it to him before. If you're feeling distant and not the same spark, it's okay to acknowledge that and move on. Don't feel guilty about it, and don't worry about doing it in person. You can have a conversation over the phone or video call and be honest about your feelings."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I would suggest waiting until you're in the same city again. You've invested a lot in this relationship, and it might be worth giving it another shot. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and see if you can work through them together. If not, then you can re-evaluate and make a decision. Remember, relationships are about growth and communication."
3. **u/sarcastic_sally**: "Girl, don't feel guilty about meeting someone new! You deserve to be happy, and if that means moving on, then so be it. You've had a good run with your boyfriend, but if you're not feeling it, then it's time to move on. Don't worry about what others think, just focus on what makes you happy."
4. **u/longdistanceproblems**: "I've been in long distance relationships before, and I can tell you that it's not easy. But if you're feeling distant and not the same spark, it might be worth re-evaluating the relationship. You can try to work on it, but if it's not meant to be, then it's okay to move on. Don't worry about doing it in person or over the phone, just be honest and respectful."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should wait until you're in the same city again. You've been apart for a while, and it might be worth giving it another shot. Have a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and see if you can work through them together. If not, then you can re-evaluate and make a decision. Remember, relationships are about growth and communication."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people suggesting that it's okay to end the relationship during long distance, while others think it's better to wait until you're in the same city again. Some people are more focused on the emotional aspect of the situation, while others are more practical. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, and it's important to consider their own feelings and what they want for their relationship. It's also important to be honest and respectful in any decision they make.

TITLE: Wrongfully sent to collections. Please help.

POST: Just checked my credit score. Instead of the usual 679, I see 587. I start freaking at see that I have a collection agency after me for $679. T-Mobile sent me to collections on a phone that I returned to them months ago. I called them multiple times months ago after I got collection notices about it. The last rep I spoke to, probably 3 months ago, told me they received the phone back and all was fine. Then I check my credit score today, and this. I'M FUCKING BEYOND LIVID

What do I do? If I dispute it and they remove me from collections, will my credit go back to 679?

TL;DR: Wrongfully sent to collections by T-Mobile for a returned phone. Help me fix this mess.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Have you tried contacting T-Mobile's customer service again? Maybe they can help resolve the issue. Also, you can dispute the collection with the credit reporting agency and provide proof that the phone was returned."
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "I would recommend sending a certified letter to the collection agency disputing the debt and requesting verification of the debt. You can also file a complaint with the CFPB. Additionally, you can try contacting T-Mobile's corporate office and escalating the issue to a supervisor."
3. **u/creditwhiz**: "You can also try contacting the credit reporting agency and asking them to remove the collection from your report. They may require proof of the debt being paid or the dispute being resolved. Also, make sure to keep a record of all your communications with T-Mobile and the collection agency."
4. **u/consumeradvocate**: "I would suggest filing a complaint with the FCC and the state's Attorney General's office. This will help to get the attention of the relevant authorities and may prompt T-Mobile to take action to resolve the issue. Additionally, you can try contacting a consumer advocacy group for assistance."
5. **u/financialwizard**: "You can also try negotiating with the collection agency to settle the debt for a lower amount. This may be a good option if you're unable to dispute the debt or if it's a small amount. Just make sure to get everything in writing and keep a record of the agreement."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP should contact T-Mobile's customer service again to resolve the issue.
* The OP should dispute the collection with the credit reporting agency and provide proof that the phone was returned.
* The OP can also file a complaint with the CFPB and the state's Attorney General's office.
* The OP should keep a record of all communications with T-Mobile and the collection agency.

TITLE: Me[26F] with my husband [38M] of six years, yells more and more everyday. How can I make it stop???

POST: My husband turned down an offer and hasn't received another one in two weeks. He has applied at 100+ places and is stressed. He has begun to yell. 

My husband grew up in a family where the dad yelled his wife and siblings into submission. I do not want my husband to become his dad. Within the last few weeks though he has. Today he even tried to yell me out so I'd succumb to his desires. He also has been turning things around and blaming me for everything. 

I want my calm loving husband back. Instead I have a man who yells. How can i solve this?

TL;DR: Husband yells more and more, blaming me for everything. He's stressed from job hunting, but I don't want him to become his dad. How can I make it stop?

TITLE: [19/m] I am in my freshman year of college with my girlfriend [18/f]. I am having an easier time adjusting and it's putting a strain on our relationship.

POST: I'll try to make this as brief as I can.

My girlfriend and I started dating during our junior year in high school and we ended up going to the same university. When we first moved in, we were both a bit overwhelmed, and it was really helpful to the both of us that we had each other during the transition. 

Since I have always adjusted pretty easily to new situations, I started to become pretty comfortable around week 3. I have gotten know a ton of people, I've made new friends and I've been doing very well in all my classes.

She, on the other hand, has been having a tougher time. She feels like she hasn't made any friends, is really struggling in her classes, and she's feeling pretty lost. I've been doing everything I can to be there for her, and spend all the time with her that I can, but it seems like we're on two different wavelengths.

One of the main reasons we're running into trouble is that since I'm meeting a ton of people and having a great time, she's worried that she's holding me back from everything. The thing is, I want to meet new friends and everything, but I wanna do it with her. I always try to get her to hang out with my friends, but she never seems happy. When I ask her why, she always says "they're your friends, you all know each other."

It's beginning to feel like I have to choose between her and my friends, and I don't want that. I love being with her, but it seems like lately, I'm all she has. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long post!

(

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old college freshman with my 18-year-old girlfriend. I'm adjusting well to college life, but she's struggling. She feels like she's holding me back and I'm torn between spending time with her and making new friends. I want to do both, but it seems like I have to choose. Help!

TITLE: How do I start moving from college/parents to financial independence? (US)

POST: I'm starting this by saying that I realize I'm extremely lucky, and I don't want to fuck it up. I don't have a precedent for my situation, so I need your collective advice:

In a few years, I'll be leaving college with no debt. I've managed a very small part-time job in addition to being full time student ($2400 in 2012, which I will file taxes on!). I'm looking at ~$3000 for 2012, + an internship stipend (which won't be much).

I've been depositing my checks at a 2:1 Savings:Checkings ratio.

I don't have a car and I won't need one. My room and food is taken care of (I even managed to get free housing for the summer) while I'm in college, and my parents have offered me a (rent-free) couch while I'm job-searching post-graduation.

Basic goals for post-graduation:
Out of my parents' house by winter, into an apartment, with a job.
It's not very realistic, but some recent alum from my department have managed it.

What else do I need to consider? What do I need?

I've been reading posts here, but I haven't seen too many very beginner posts, and I did check out the FAQs, but I don't exactly have money to do anything with.

TL;DR: I'm a college student with no debt, part-time job, and parents' support. I want to move out, get a job, and be financially independent. What do I need to do?

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Congrats on being debt-free and having a supportive family! You're off to a great start. Here are a few things to consider:

* Build an emergency fund: Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. This will help you cover unexpected costs and avoid going into debt.
* Create a budget: Track your income and expenses to see where your money is going. Make sure you're not overspending in any one area.
* Start saving for retirement: Even if it's just a small amount each month, it's a good habit to get into.
* Consider opening a Roth IRA: It's a great way to save for retirement and get some tax benefits.
* Look into affordable health insurance: You may be able to get a plan through your school or a private provider.
* Start building credit: You can do this by opening a credit card and using it responsibly.

2. **u/financialfreedom**: I'm glad you're thinking about your financial future! Here are a few additional tips:

* Take advantage of your parents' offer: Use their couch as a temporary solution while you're job searching. It'll save you money on rent and give you time to focus on finding a job.
* Start looking for apartments early: Research different neighborhoods and prices to find a place that fits your budget. You can also consider sharing an apartment with roommates to split the cost.
* Consider a side hustle: In addition to your part-time job, look for other ways to make extra money. This could be freelancing, dog walking, or tutoring.
* Build an investment portfolio: Even if it's just a small amount each month, it's a good idea to start building a portfolio. You can consider opening a brokerage account and investing in a mix of stocks and bonds.

3. **u/youngadult**: I'm in a similar situation, and I've found that it's helpful to have a clear plan in place. Here are a few things to consider:

* Set specific goals: What do you want to achieve in the next year? In the next five years? Having specific goals will help you stay focused and motivated.
* Create a timeline: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you stay on track and make progress towards your goals.
* Prioritize your spending: Make sure you're prioritizing your spending based on your goals. For example, if you're trying to save for a down payment on a house, you may want to prioritize saving over spending on entertainment.
* Build an emergency fund: Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. This will help you cover unexpected costs and avoid going into debt.
* Consider a budgeting app: There are many budgeting apps available that can help you track your spending and stay on top of your finances.

* Start by tracking your income and expenses: This will help you see where your money is going and identify areas where you can cut back.
* Create a budget: Based on your income and expenses, create a budget that outlines your projected income and expenses for the next year.

TITLE: Furniture suggestions...long term project

POST: Hi there Just moved from NY to SF with my wife and we are going to start out on our first place together since we stopped being broke-2nd-hand-ikea-furniture users. Starting out so on a budget and honestly, have no idea how to think of interior design so looking for help.
This intends to be a long term project, one where i post pictures of before and after, compile a list of stores and design ideas!
Description: live in SF victorian apartment (well, plan on, once we find it! still in a sublet), not terribly large
So, first task: what are the core pieces of furniture in each room? For instance, in the bedroom, i am guessing its the bed that would decide the color and kind of accessories like chest of drawers? And in the living room, i suppose i should get a couch before anything else?

TL;DR: Help me plan my furniture, especially on a budget! What are the must-haves in each room? And what are some good stores for second-hand and affordable furniture?

---

**Comments:**

* "Start with the essentials: bed, couch, table, chairs. Then add decorative pieces as you go. Don't worry too much about 'design' at first, just focus on functionality and comfort."
* "Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are great resources for second-hand furniture. You can also try local thrift stores and Habitat for Humanity ReStores."
* "For a budget-friendly option, consider IKEA. They have a wide range of affordable furniture pieces. You can also try online retailers like Wayfair or Overstock."
* "Don't forget to measure your space before buying furniture! You don't want to end up with pieces that are too big or too small for your room."
* "Consider repurposing or upcycling old furniture to give it a unique touch. You can also try refinishing or painting old pieces to give them a fresh look."
* "For a SF Victorian apartment, you might want to consider furniture with a more vintage or antique vibe. Check out local antique stores or online marketplaces like Chairish or 1stdibs."
* "Remember to prioritize what's most important to you and your wife. If you're both gamers, for example, you might want to invest in a comfortable gaming chair. If you love to cook, a good kitchen table might be a priority."
* "Take your time and don't rush into buying anything. Keep an eye out for deals and discounts, and be willing to negotiate prices. You can also try trading or swapping furniture with friends or family members."

TITLE: My apartment is infested with mice and management has done very little to help. What are my options?

POST: So I moved into my apartment back in May. Things have constantly gone wrong since day one. Now usually when something goes wrong they take a couple days to come fix which isn't a big deal as long as its not something serious. Shortly after moving in we noticed mouse crap in the cabinets. Then we stated seeing them. We told maintenance and they came by and put traps down. We caught a good 3 or 4 mice. Then we started catching 1 every couple of weeks and seeing/hearing them every couple of days. The apartment management just kept on sending us traps. Now the mice seem to have had babies because we see mice multiple times a day and they are getting into all of my food. management seems to think that providing us traps is all they have to do and its our problem. This is a serious problem that traps won't fix. We need an exterminator but they clearly don't want to pay for one to come. But this is a health risk in my opinion. Is there any sort of legal action I can take? Or at least threaten to take to get them to act?

TL;DR: Mice infestation in apartment, management has done little to help, looking for options to get them to take action.

COMMENTS:

* "Have you tried talking to the landlord directly? Sometimes they're more willing to listen and take action when it's a one-on-one conversation. Also, have you considered taking photos and videos of the infestation and sending them to the landlord? Visual evidence can be powerful in getting them to take action."
* "I would suggest sending a formal letter to the landlord detailing the issue, the steps you've taken so far, and the consequences of not taking action. You can also mention any local health codes or regulations that are being violated. This will put the issue in writing and give you a paper trail."
* "Have you tried contacting your local health department? They may be able to inspect the apartment and issue a citation to the landlord if they find that the infestation is a health hazard."
* "I would also suggest looking into your lease agreement and seeing if there's anything that mentions the landlord's responsibility for pest control. If there is, you can use that as leverage to get them to take action."
* "You could also try contacting a local pest control company and getting a quote for the extermination. Then, present that to the landlord and say that you're willing to split the cost if they agree to hire the company. This way, you're not out of pocket for the extermination, but you're also not stuck with a landlord who won't take action."
* "I would suggest being prepared to move out if the landlord doesn't take action. You have the right to a safe and habitable living space, and if the landlord is unwilling to provide that, you may need to take matters into your own hands and find a new place to live."

This post and its comments provide a good example of how to handle a situation where a landlord is not taking responsibility for a serious issue, such as a pest infestation. The OP is seeking advice on how to get the landlord to take action, and the commenters are offering suggestions on how to do so, including talking to the landlord directly, sending a formal letter, contacting local authorities, and seeking legal action. The comments also highlight the importance of having a paper trail and being prepared to take action if the landlord does not respond. Overall, this post and its comments demonstrate a sense of community and a willingness to help each other out in a difficult situation.

TITLE: Not sure if I should approach my girlfriend about cheating on me [21m/f]

POST: This is something that's been eating at me for the last few months and I just want to get it off my chest.

Some back story. She had a boyfriend before me let's call him, John. She and John and a pretty rocky relationship from what I was told and witnessed myself. Anyway after a while they broke up and we got together and it was great. Fast forward to when I was away on holiday during Christmas 2012, she ends up seeing him and says how nothing happened between them. However after another incident in August she let me read through her texts and I found one from that day saying "Last night can't mean nothing. What was i thinking. Im not that type of person" And then a day or so after he sent something saying "Sorry about your neck" (she was big on biting necks and loves it done to her too)

So yeah she says she didn't sleep with him when she told me about this when it happened. But I don't think I believe her just because how she's lied to me in the past about seeing him and especially after reading those messages. Should I bring it up with her somehow or what? Thank you for reading it feels good to get this out.

TL;DR: Girlfriend had a rocky relationship with an ex, we got together, but she had contact with him after we got together, and I found some suspicious messages. I'm not sure if I should bring it up with her or not.

RESPONSES:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're already pretty sure she cheated on you. If you're feeling this strongly about it, it's probably worth having a conversation with her about it. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might deny it again, or even get defensive. Try to approach the conversation calmly and without accusations. Ask her to explain the messages and what was going on. Good luck, and I hope you get some clarity out of it."
* "I would definitely bring it up with her. It's not fair to you if she's still in contact with her ex and you're not sure what's going on. You deserve honesty and respect in your relationship. Just make sure you're not accusatory or aggressive when you bring it up, and try to have an open and honest conversation about it."
* "I think you should definitely have a conversation with her about it. It's not just about the messages, it's about the fact that she's still in contact with her ex and that's a red flag. You deserve better than someone who's still got feelings for someone else. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might not want to talk about it or might get defensive. Try to stay calm and have an open and honest conversation about it."
* "I would not bring it up with her. It's not worth the potential drama and stress it could cause in your relationship. You've already had issues with her lying to you in the past, and bringing this up could just lead to more lies and denial. Just focus on moving forward and enjoying your relationship with her, and try to put the past behind you."

This subreddit is a great resource for people seeking advice on their relationships. The community is active and engaged, with many users sharing their own experiences and offering words of wisdom. The responses to this post are varied, but most users agree that the OP should have a conversation with their girlfriend about the situation.

A few users advise against bringing it up at all, citing the potential for drama and stress in the relationship.

TITLE: My boyfriend (23/m) cheated on me (21/f) over webcam after four+ years

POST: So me and my boyfriend have been together for four and a half years! We recently moved out together and have our own lovely apartment... Out relationship seemed to be like no other.. I never questioned the love, loyalty, and honesty we had for each other. We never hit rock bottom and we never had serious issues together. Everything was near perfect. About a month ago, I was on his computer and came across his Facebook.. Which was logged In already... Found mail from a girl that lead me to look on his Skype. Went onto his Skype and found something I wish I never found! My boyfriend had a very intimate Skype call and convo with a girl he got off a webcam site! The things he said to her really hurt me... He said things I have never heard him say! The call lasted 15 minutes and they were both naked on the call, doing you know what.. I do classify this as cheating and surely he would have known i thought that.. I am having a lot of trouble forgiving him... he tried to convince me at first how he thought it was not cheating, he has since tried showing me he made a big mistake.. But I don't know if I can get past this.. It's ruined the special relationship we had together and I don't feel like I love him the same way.

TL;DR: My boyfriend cheated on me over webcam after 4+ years together. I'm having trouble forgiving him and don't know if I can get past this.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It's understandable that you're having trouble forgiving him. Cheating is a huge betrayal of trust. Have you talked to him about how you're feeling and what you need from him to move forward?
2. **RelationshipGuru**: OP, it's great that you're taking the time to process your emotions. Forgiveness is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. Have you considered couples therapy to work through this together? It might help you both communicate better and work towards healing.
3. **SkepticalSarah**: OP, I'm not trying to be harsh, but it sounds like your boyfriend has some serious issues to work through. Cheating is never okay, and it's not just about the act itself, but the lack of respect and trust he showed you. You deserve better than someone who would do this to you. Take the time you need to figure out what you want, and don't rush into anything.
4. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for your boyfriend to cheat on you, and it's not okay for him to try to downplay it or make excuses. You deserve honesty and respect in your relationship. Have you considered taking a break or re-evaluating whether this relationship is healthy for you?
5. **LoveIsALie**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's clear that your boyfriend has some serious issues, and it's not okay for him to cheat on you. You deserve better than someone who would do this to you. Take the time you need to figure out what you want, and don't rush into anything. Remember, you deserve love and respect, and you don't have to settle for anything less.

TITLE: I (17M) asked a girl (16F) to homecoming that I hasn't gone to our school for over a year. How do I break the ice so it won't be so awkward when we meet?

POST: So I asked this girl I had a huge crush on last year to hoco via text. We didn't really talk much last year but getting to know her via internet she's a really cool and very intelligent girl and I grew the man power to ask her to go with me. 

Here's the problem, I haven't sent her in over a year and she lives half an hour away how do I break the ice so it won't be awkward when we see each other face to face. 

We're both really socially awkward and I feel like I set myself up for an awkward night. But she was really stoked I asked so I feel like she may have feelings for me.

TL;DR: I asked a girl to homecoming that I haven't seen in over a year, how do I break the ice so it's not awkward when we meet?

COMMENT 1: "Hey, OP! I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, be respectful, and have a genuine conversation. You're not trying to 'break the ice' or impress her, you're just being a normal human being. Remember, she said yes to going with you, so she's already shown interest. Just relax and enjoy the night!"

COMMENT 2: "I agree with the above comment, but also consider sending her a message a day or two before the dance to confirm the plans and maybe even ask her about her interests or what she's looking forward to. This can help you both feel more comfortable and prepared for the night. Also, don't worry too much about being 'awkward', it's okay to be a little nervous, and it's actually a sign of respect and enthusiasm!"

COMMENT 3: "I think you're focusing too much on the 'awkward' aspect and not enough on the fact that you asked her to homecoming! That's a huge deal, and she's probably excited to go with you. Instead of worrying about breaking the ice, focus on being a good partner and making sure she has a great time. Ask her about her interests, listen to what she has to say, and be respectful of her boundaries. And hey, even if things do get a little awkward, it's okay! It's just a dance, and it's not the end of the world."

COMMENT 4: "I think you should also consider the fact that she's 16 and you're 17. While it's not a huge age difference, it's still important to be mindful of the power dynamic and make sure you're treating her with respect and kindness. Just a thought!" 

COMMENT 5: "I'm a girl and I've been in a similar situation before. What I did was send a message a day or two before the event to confirm the plans and also ask her about her favorite music or movies. It helped me feel more comfortable and prepared for the night. Also, try to relax and be yourself, and don't worry too much about being 'awkward'. It's okay to be a little nervous, and it's actually a sign of respect and enthusiasm!" 

The comments offer a range of advice, from simply being yourself and relaxing to sending a message before the event to confirm plans and ask about her interests. Some comments also touch on the importance of respecting the power dynamic given the age difference. Overall, the comments aim to help the OP feel more comfortable and prepared for the night, while also emphasizing the importance of being respectful and kind.

TITLE: What's the most awkward or cringeworthy thing that's ever happened to you in a social situation?

POST: I'm just wondering what kind of stories people have. I've had my fair share of awkward moments, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.

COMMENT 1: "I was at a wedding once and I accidentally spilled an entire glass of red wine all over the bride's dress. I was mortified. The worst part was that I tried to play it cool and just laughed it off, but everyone else was like 'OH NO, THE BRIDE'S DRESS!' and I was just standing there, frozen in shame."

COMMENT 2: "I was on a date once and I accidentally farted really loudly. I was so embarrassed that I just got up and left the table, leaving my date to deal with the awkwardness. I never went on another date with that person again."

COMMENT 3: "I was at a job interview once and I accidentally knocked over a plant. The interviewer was like 'Oh, don't worry about it, it's just a plant' but I was mortified. I just wanted to crawl under the table and die."

COMMENT 4: "I was at a party once and I accidentally sang along to a song that I thought was a different song. It was a really embarrassing moment, but I just laughed it off and pretended like I meant to do it."

COMMENT 5: "I was on a first date once and I accidentally told the person that I was still in a relationship. I was so embarrassed that I just got up and left, leaving the person to deal with the awkwardness. I never went on another date with that person again."

The comments on this post are a mix of funny and cringeworthy stories about awkward social situations. People share their own embarrassing moments, from spilling drinks to farting loudly, and everyone seems to have a good laugh about it.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with [20 F], she apparently wants to meet me but I have no idea what to do.

POST: So I'm a student at a university and I've seen a girl around a few times from a distance who I thought was absolutely gorgeous. Since she is in a sorority and me a fraternity, I know a lot of her friends and when I asked them about her they were quick to tell me she's the perfect girl personality wise for me. So, one of our mutual friends who is really close to this girl told her about me and told me she wanted to meet me, gave me her number, and said it would be okay to text her so I did. We had a decent conversation going and it abruptly stopped. It was late, she probably fell asleep. So I followed the double texting rule and waited three days to try to reach out again. After I got the conversation going I asked her if she would like to meet me for coffee and she said she wouldn't be able to that week because of how busy she was with a weeklong philanthropy event. Even though she kept the conversation going for a while (that abruptly stopped again) I took it as a rejection and decided I wouldn't press it again. After that, I told another mutual friend who sits next to her in class and she said she actually was really busy with this philanthropy event and not to take it personal and that she'd talk to her about relationships without mentioning my name. So they talked and this girl told her a guy had been mean to her and she wanted to focus on school.

This was about three weeks ago, and her close friend said she'd give it one more try. I want to. This girl apparently is super sweet and has a great personality and I really want to get a chance to meet her but I don't know what to do and I'm scared of coming on too strong and creeping her out. What's your take?

TL;DR: Girl I've had a crush on wants to meet me but I'm scared of coming on too strong and creeping her out. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "Don't overthink it, just be yourself and see where it goes. If she's interested, she'll make an effort to keep the conversation going. If not, then it's not meant to be." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I think you're overanalyzing this. Just ask her out again, this time suggest a specific date and time, and see what she says. If she says no, then move on. If she says yes, then you can start building a relationship." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I would suggest taking it slow and getting to know her better before asking her out. You can start by asking her about her interests and hobbies, and see if you have any common ground. This will help you build a connection with her and make it less likely that she'll feel creeped out." (u/smartgirl123)
* "Don't be afraid to show your interest, but also don't be too aggressive. You can say something like 'Hey, I've really enjoyed talking to you and I was wondering if you'd like to grab coffee sometime?' This shows that you're interested, but also gives her an easy out if she's not interested." (u/ datingcoach)
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on this. Just relax and be yourself. If she's interested, she'll make it clear. If not, then it's not the end of the world. You can always try again in the future." (u/ chillvibesonly)

TITLE: We did it! Review + Pictures!

POST: My husband (!!) and I tied the knot April 9th, we planned every little detail ourselves and paid for it ourselves. (Well with some help from my parents). And all decor was DIY'D. It was a LONG year and a half, but seeing it all come together was worth it!

Some things that went well...

* Seeing my husband's face during our first look. He bawled like a baby and it was the most treasured moment of the whole day and probably my whole life. 

* Our officiant killed it! We had guest after guest comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, some said it was the most emotional wedding they'd ever been too. And a friend's mom said our vows made her question her marriage (yeah, that was a weird comment). But it was worth it to custom curate our ceremony with our officiant, it was so special and even though I was so nervous I'm glad we wrote our own vows. 

Things that went wrong...

* My father in law hit my day of coordinator's car before the ceremony... I didn't find out about it until we checked into our hotel that night. But during our first dance it was funny to hear my husband go "I have so much to tell you..." Everything was fine though! He just scraped the side of her truck with his, but she handled it like a PRO. She just told him well, today is you son's day so we'll exchange info later and take care of it tomorrow, let's worry about the wedding first. She really was just fantastic all around.

Advice...

* Get a day of coordinator if you can. It is SO much easier than taking care of it yourself/having a friend or family member do it. We paid $500 for a DoC to setup/break down everything and she really made the day go smoothly and kept us on top of everything.

* Make as detailed of a timeline as possible. It was a little stressful coordinating who was leaving the hotel with who to the venue, etc. Also my husband had to pick a lot of people up at the airport, so maybe pay a friend from your area to be a designated taxi. It was different with us since 90% of our guests were out of town.

TL;DR: We did it! We planned our own wedding, paid for it ourselves, and did all the decor DIY. It was a long year and a half, but seeing it all come together was worth it! We had some hiccups, but our day of coordinator was amazing and helped everything run smoothly. If you can, get a DoC and make a detailed timeline. And don't forget to enjoy the little moments, like seeing your husband's face during your first look!

[Insert pictures of the wedding]

**Comments:**

* Congratulations! Your wedding looks beautiful and I love that you did everything yourself. What was the most stressful part of planning for you?

TITLE: I'm (17m) not sure if I still love my gf (17f), and I think I have a crush on our good mutual friend (17f)

POST: So my gf (let's call her Amy) and I have been dating for over 3 years. We've gone through a lot of things together, good and bad. She was my first kiss, first gf, and I lost my virginity to her. We have had many talks about the future and getting married to each other. 

We regularly hang out with the same group of friends in and out of school. It consists of roughly 10 people. Around 3 of them are guys. The thing is we are all very close and hang out pretty much all the time. I've been getting very close to one of the girls in the group (let's call her Nancy). I was friends with her before I started dating Amy. Recently, I've gotten very close to Nancy. I've told her many things that I wouldn't even tell Amy. Some people have accused us up of "flirting" and have told Amy, who easily gets upset. Now, I'm a friendly person to begin with. I'm fine with making contact with all of my friends and I mess around with all of them, so I don't think of it as flirting. 

This has put me under a lot of pressure recently though. Since our group is mainly girls, I talk to girls pretty much everyday. But I feel like I have to act differently due to my gf. I feel like I can't laugh as much or talk as much, so Amy won't get jealous. 

Nancy trusts me and I trust her. We're pretty much best friends. But I think I might be developing a crush on her. 

I've started to care for Amy a little less, but I'm pretty sure I still love her. Breaking up with her would also be very awkward because we hang around the same group of people and our class is very small (97). Thank you.

TL;DR: I'm 17, been dating my girlfriend for 3 years, but I've been getting close to our mutual friend Nancy and I think I might have a crush on her. I'm not sure if I still love my girlfriend, but breaking up with her would be awkward due to our shared social circle. Help.

TITLE: I just got a call about my grandpa...I need your help reddit.

POST: Growing up I always knew there was something off about him. I loved him to pieces, but he was always adamantly anti-government and anti-corporation. I know a lot of us redditors are too but as time went on its manifested its self in different ways.

We went to the movie theater one day and he complained that someone took a picture of him. He thought he was being spied on and wanted to leave. (There was no one there, it was in his mind)

Our family got a call yesterday, and it seems now he won't even leave his trailer to get food. He told the neighbor that the voices told him to stand in a hole in his house to keep people away. He's getting worse, and tomorrow I'm going to be going with my mom and anut to help deal with the situation.

I was reading on wikipedia that only.3 -.7% of the population is effected Schizophrenia; which is what we believe it is as this point. I'm really hoping I can find someone to help me out here. Have you known someone who has had Schizophrenia, how did you deal with it? Any advice you can give us?

TL;DR: My grandpa is showing signs of Schizophrenia and I'm going to help my family deal with the situation. I'm looking for advice and stories from people who have dealt with it.

TITLE: I [25F] just amended bad blood with my ex [27M] and now desperately need help with a response.

POST: My ex and I dated for 6 1/2 years and it ended HORRIBLY! He started all but dating this other girl while we were still together (emotional cheating, never anything physical). The thing is, the whole time I was reading his texts behind his back and saw his conversations with the girl, our mutual best friend, and his sister all shit talking me while having this relationship develop. I felt so crazy constantly reading his texts but everytime I would look I would find something for months. Finally, I got the strength to dump him, told him I hate him and never talk to me again, and got a new BF about a month later and we're so happy together and living together now. The ex is still with the same girl. 

TODAY I contacted my ex for the first time in a year and a half. I just said I don't hate you and I'm sorry for how I reacted. He said he was so happy I didn't hate him and gave me some updates about his life. It's been friendly messages and it feels like this weight is lifted off my shoulders because I don't have this burned bridge out there in the universe. (my current bf knows everything and is perfectly fine with me getting the closure I need). 

Here's the thing: I've always, always thought for the last year and a half that I will finally be completely healed once I can tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. He only told me that he went to the library with her once, so he thinks I just reacted in a crazy strong way over that. I need to say to him: Look, I reacted so strongly because I was reading the texts between you and her, you and our mutual friend, and you and your sister. I saw all the shit you talked about me and I thought that you hated me which made me want to hate you. I need to say something like that to him now to finally put this all behind me but I don't know how to say it without making myself seem insane and like I'm still living in the past. I need advice on this desperately please help.

TL;DR: I just reconnected with my ex after a year and a half and I desperately need help figuring out how to tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. I don't know how to say it without making myself seem insane or like I'm still living in the past.

**Comments:**

1. OP, you're not insane for feeling the way you did. You were in a toxic relationship and had every right to be upset. You don't owe anyone an explanation for how you reacted. If you do decide to tell him, do it in a calm and assertive tone. You're not seeking his validation, you're seeking closure.
2. I think you should just be honest with him. You're not going to get closure by sugarcoating the truth. You can say something like, "Hey, I wanted to be honest with you. I was reading your texts and saw the conversations you had with [her name] and our mutual friend. It made me feel really hurt and betrayed. I'm glad we can have a friendly conversation now, but I needed to be honest with you about why I reacted the way I did."
3. OP, you're not living in the past by wanting to have this conversation. You're taking control of your emotions and seeking closure. That's a healthy and mature thing to do. Don't worry about what your ex thinks, worry about what you need to move on.
4. I think you should just leave it alone. You've already moved on and are happy with your new partner. Don't give your ex the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt you. You don't owe him anything.
5. OP, you're not insane for wanting to have this conversation. You're not seeking revenge or trying to hurt him, you're seeking closure and understanding. You deserve that. Go for it and don't worry about what others think.

TITLE: Me [24, M] with my girlfriend[23, F] have been together long distance almost a year, needing advice on long term plan.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but it's been entirely long distance (9 hours apart) with us taking turns seeing each other on weekends twice a month, and spending a week together on a couple occasions. 

My girlfriend was job hunting at the beginning of this past summer when there were two jobs opening up. One about 20 minutes from my house, another an hour further north of where she had been living. The job that was further away gave her $10K more a year than what she would've made living by me. I had no problem encouraging  this path because we had only been together a few months at that time, and wouldn't want her throwing her future away for me. 

Due to some unfortunate circumstances (my dad being in the hospital, her having to work multiple hours of overtime, a couple deaths in her family, etc.) we haven't been able to see each other this month and during the holidays. She told me a few weeks ago that she felt bad that she couldn't come home to me and felt lonely even though we can and do Skype, and basically that the distance is hurting her. I had already been thinking about moving up there, but was going to wait until the school year is over so I don't leave my employer in a sticky situation.

I'm a teacher at a private school, and even though my pay isn't awful, I'd be the one to make the move since it's an easier move for me. It also helps that I have friends that live in and around the same city she lives and works in. I want to offer to move up there, but don't know how to bring it up to her as we've been somewhat distant with everything going on.

TL;DR: Long distance couple, almost a year together, girlfriend got a job an hour away from where she was living, I'm a teacher and want to move up there to be with her, but don't know how to bring it up.

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

* Be honest and open with your girlfriend about your feelings and plans. It's better to have a conversation about it rather than keeping it to yourself.
* Consider having a video call to discuss your plans and feelings with your girlfriend. This way, you can both be in the same space and have a more intimate conversation.
* Make sure to listen to your girlfriend's concerns and feelings about the move. It's not just about you, but also about her and how she will adjust to the new situation.
* Be prepared to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you. It may not be a simple solution, but it's worth discussing and finding a way to make it work.
* Remember that relationships are about compromise and communication. It's okay to have different opinions and perspectives, but it's important to find a way to work through them together.

**ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:**

* "It's great that you're thinking about your girlfriend's feelings and well-being. However, it's also important to consider your own feelings and what you want for your future. Make sure to communicate your thoughts and feelings with your girlfriend and come to a decision that works for both of you."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to make a sacrifice for your girlfriend. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of moving to a new city. Make sure to research the area, find a new job, and have a plan in place before making the move."
* "It's great that you're thinking about your girlfriend's job and how it may affect your relationship. However, it's also important to consider your own career goals and aspirations. Make sure to communicate your thoughts and feelings with your girlfriend and come to a decision that works for both of you."

TITLE: TIFU by contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source.

POST: So this happened a few weeks ago on my holiday to India. Back story: Indian toilets don't usually have toilet paper and are more often than not simply a hole in the ground that you squat over. I went to deposit a particularly nasty load of liquid shit or what the locals refer to as "Delhi belly". I'd also recently been given some very expensive glasses by my parents and was under pain of death not to lose them. So I was squatting down unleashing this never ending torrent of diarrhoea when my glasses dropped off my head and fell down the hole. In a state of blind panic and fear I shoved my hand into the bottomless pit of shit in an attempt to find my glasses and, after dipping my arm elbow-deep in shit, eventually discovered them and pulled them out. As they were covered in shit I didn't put them on and instead stumbled around outside half blind to find somewhere to wash them off, finding a small shack surrounded by what I assumed was a queue of people with a huge urn of water inside. Pushing through the crowd, I quickly rinsed my shit covered arm and glasses in this urn of cold water, returned the glasses to their rightful place and, feeling rather pleased with my lucky escape, strolled outside. I then realised my FU....the queue was full of people holding various jugs and cups and a sign on the shack read "DRINKING WATER" in bright red bold letters.

TL;DR: I contaminated an Indian village's drinking water source by washing my shit-covered arm and glasses in it.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a hilarious and cringe-worthy tale of how they messed up in a big way. In this case, the author's careless actions led to contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source, which is a serious issue in many parts of the world.

The post is entertaining because of the author's vivid description of the situation, including the use of colorful language and exaggerated emotions. The image of the author's "Delhi belly" and their frantic search for their glasses is particularly amusing.

However, it's also important to note that the author's actions were reckless and irresponsible, and could have had serious consequences for the people in the village. It's a good reminder to always be mindful of our actions and their potential impact on others, especially in unfamiliar environments.

Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story, and it's a good reminder to always be careful and considerate of others, even in the most embarrassing and cringe-worthy situations.

TITLE: Combining finances with my soon to be husband, but I owe him $25,000

POST: My fiance and I are beginning to combine finances and working through our plan for that. That's not the problem. 1 year ago my fiance paid off my car loan to help me with the accumulating interest. I had/have every intention of paying him back and now I'm in a financial situation where I can. However, our incomes are now going into our joint bank account and it's basically "our money". We talked about putting the repayments into a seperate account that is essentially "his", but we're not sure if that's the best way to go about it. I will not be able to pay this off completely for a couple years as we are saving for a house as well, so we don't want to wait until I finish paying him back before combining finances.

TL;DR: I owe my fiance $25,000 from a car loan he paid off for me. We're combining finances and I want to start paying him back, but we're unsure how to handle it.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "I would suggest setting up a separate account for the repayment, as you mentioned. This way, you can make regular payments and track your progress. You can also consider setting up automatic transfers from your joint account to the repayment account. This will ensure that you're making consistent payments and not forgetting about the debt."
2. **u/savvy_spender**: "I agree with setting up a separate account for the repayment. However, I would also suggest having a clear plan for how you'll pay off the debt. Will you be making monthly payments, or will you be paying it off in installments? Having a clear plan will help you stay on track and avoid any misunderstandings."
3. **u/frugal_fiona**: "I think it's great that you're taking responsibility for paying back your fiance. However, I would caution against setting up a separate account for the repayment. Instead, you could consider making regular payments from your joint account. This will help you stay on track and avoid any potential conflicts about the debt."
4. **u/cashflowking**: "I would suggest setting up a repayment schedule and sticking to it. You can use a budgeting app or spreadsheet to track your progress and make sure you're making consistent payments. It's also important to communicate regularly with your fiance about your progress and any changes to your repayment plan."
5. **u/personalfinance_pro**: "I agree with setting up a separate account for the repayment. However, I would also suggest considering a compromise. Instead of making regular payments, you could consider making a lump sum payment every quarter or every 6 months. This will give you more flexibility and allow you to adjust your repayment plan as needed."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Setting up a separate account for the repayment is a good idea to track progress and make consistent payments.
* Having a clear plan for paying off the debt is important to stay on track and avoid misunderstandings.
* Making regular payments from the joint account can be a good option, but it's important to communicate regularly with your fiance about your progress.
* A repayment schedule and regular communication are key to successfully paying off the debt.
* Consider setting up automatic transfers from the joint account to the repayment account to ensure consistent payments.

TITLE: My boyfriend want to give me an "allowance". [F 18]

POST: Throwaway for identity reasons.

My SO [m 18] and I [f 18] have been dating for five, almost six years and are very serious, despite being so young. We don't live together and he works all week, so we don't see each other very often either. Out of nowhere he starts telling me I need to accept more from him. More gestures, gifts...money. I didn't know how to respond. I've heard of a husband doing this for his wife and vice versa, but never a boyfriend for his girlfriend. After refusing this multiple times, he said *this*, "It'll make me happy." How would it make him happy? How should I respond? Should I take it?

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to give me an "allowance" and I don't know how to respond. Is this normal? Should I take it?

---

**Comments:**

* "This is not normal. It sounds like he's trying to control you. You don't need an allowance from your boyfriend. You're an adult and should be able to make your own financial decisions."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how this makes you feel. Tell him that you feel like he's trying to control you and that you don't need an allowance. You're an adult and should be able to make your own financial decisions."
* "I think you should take it. It's the thought that counts, right? But seriously, if you're not comfortable with it, you should talk to him about it and see if you can come to a compromise."
* "This is a red flag. He's trying to control you and make you dependent on him. You need to have a serious talk with him about this and set some boundaries."
* "I think you should try to understand where he's coming from. Maybe he's feeling guilty about not being able to spend as much time with you as he'd like and this is his way of trying to make it up to you. But you should still have an open and honest conversation with him about how this makes you feel."
* "This is not normal and you should not take it. You're an adult and should be able to make your own financial decisions. You should have a serious talk with him about this and set some boundaries."
* "I think you should try to compromise. Maybe you can agree to let him give you a certain amount of money each month, but you should also make sure that you're not dependent on him for everything. You should have your own financial independence."
* "This is a control issue. He's trying to control you and make you dependent on him. You need to have a serious talk with him about this and set some boundaries."
* "I think you should try to understand where he's coming from, but you should also make sure that you're not compromising your own financial independence. You should have a serious talk with him about this and set some boundaries."
* "This is not normal and you should not take it. You're an adult and should be able to make your own financial decisions. You should have a serious talk with him about this and set some boundaries." (multiple comments)

**Conclusion:**

The majority of the comments on this post are in agreement that giving an "allowance" is not normal or healthy in a relationship, especially when the partner is not dependent on the other for financial support. Many commenters suggest that the boyfriend is trying to control the girlfriend and that she should have a serious talk with him about setting boundaries and respecting her financial independence. Some commenters suggest that the girlfriend should try to understand where her boyfriend is coming from, but ultimately, she should prioritize her own financial independence and autonomy. Overall, the comments on this post suggest that giving an "allowance" is not a healthy or normal aspect of a relationship.

TITLE: Me [19F] with my boyfriend [22 M] 6 months, he constantly posts half-naked pictures on instagram

POST: So he and I both have instagram but I don't post anything just because I like to keep my life private and I'm not crazy about the whole social media thing. 

I have no problem with him posting stuff, I like to see all the cute stuff he posts, and he often posts pictures of us. But he also posts shirtless pictures of himself, and sometimes girls will comment saying how attractive he is or whatever. 

Am I right to be uncomfortable? I haven't said anything because I don't want to be controlling and I don't really think it's my place. But really, I compliment him all the time and tell him how good looking he is, why does he need constant validation from random strangers on instagram? 

My ex was not into social media that much and I liked that about him. Maybe there are just different types of people, and I am not really compatible with current bf? The attention-craving attitude is really a turn off for me.

TL;DR: Boyfriend posts half-naked pictures on instagram, gets attention from girls, I'm uncomfortable but don't want to be controlling. Am I right to feel this way?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not being controlling, you're being reasonable. It's okay to have boundaries and communicate them to your partner. Maybe have a conversation with him about how you feel and see how he responds."
* "I'm a girl and I would be uncomfortable too. It's not about being controlling, it's about respecting your partner's boundaries and feelings. You're right, he's getting validation from strangers, but it's not the same as the validation you give him. Maybe he's not as secure as you think he is."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about this and not just ignoring it. It's okay to have different opinions and boundaries. Maybe you can find a compromise, like him posting less often or only posting pictures of you two together. Communication is key!"
* "I'm a guy and I think it's weird that he's posting half-naked pictures. I get it, he's trying to get attention, but it's not attractive to me either. Maybe he's just trying to prove something to himself or others, but it's not worth it. You're right to be uncomfortable and you should talk to him about it."
* "I think you're being too sensitive. He's just trying to have fun and show off his body. It's not like he's posting explicit content or anything. Maybe you're just jealous that he's getting attention from other girls."
* "I'm a girl and I think it's okay to post half-naked pictures if that's what makes you feel good. But if you're uncomfortable with it, then it's okay to talk to him about it. Maybe he doesn't realize how it's making you feel. Communication is key!"

This post highlights the importance of communication in relationships. The OP is uncomfortable with her boyfriend's behavior on Instagram, but she's hesitant to bring it up because she doesn't want to be controlling. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from understanding and supportive to dismissive and critical. Ultimately, the OP needs to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about how his behavior is making her feel. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact his posts are having, and a conversation can help him understand her perspective and find a compromise that works for both of them. The post also raises questions about the role of social media in relationships and the importance of respecting each other's boundaries and feelings.

TITLE: Last night I got promoted at work...twice. I've been working there for a week. What are some of your work success stories?

POST: As is custom, I'll start. 

For one reason or another, my full time job ended up not having any work for me to do during the summer, so I decided to take a part time job. A statewide-famous sandwich shop in my state decided to open up a new store in my town, and I applied and was hired immediately. I started training last week, and we opened the store up for the first time this week.

Yesterday, while pulling a double covering for someone else, my boss informs me that I've been promoted, including a raise and further duties with closing the store and sending reports off to the franchise at the end of the night, etc. I'm pleased, since a promotion in a week seems like a good thing to me. Fast forward two hours, and my boss has a personal emergency. He pulls me into his office, explains the situation, and says, "I hate to drop this all on you tonight, but I'm gonna need you to take over as manager. I figured it'd happen anyway, but wanted to give you more time to ease into it. You gonna be okay to do it?" I accepted, and he left to handle his business, with me in charge of two teenagers who'd worked there just as long as I had.

TL;DR: Got promoted twice at a new job after one week, including a raise and taking over as manager.

TITLE: Is there a non-creepy way for me [26M] to approach her [24F] at work?

POST: Hi there, I'll try to keep it short.

There is a girl who works at my go-to grocery store who I would like to get to know better. She really brighten's up my day when I go there and I'm absolutley stunned by her everytime I go there. I know it's hard to approach people at work, but the last thing I will do is creep outside the store until she heads home - HELL NO.

I've been thinking of a way to approach her but everything seems kind of creepy, like just going up to her out of the blue and telling her that I think she's cute and that I would like to get to know her better. Is there a smoother way of doing this?

I know nothing about her except for her Name and her Age. But something tells me that I would like to get to know her more. I've never done nor felt the urge to approach somebody outside of a bar.

Thanks!

TL;DR: I want to get to know a girl who works at my go-to grocery store, but I don't want to come across as creepy. Is there a non-creepy way to approach her?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just be friendly and genuine. Ask her how her day is going, or compliment her on something you genuinely appreciate about her. Don't make it about you, make it about her. And for the love of all things good, don't tell her you think she's cute out of the blue. That's just creepy."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're looking at this from the wrong angle. Instead of trying to 'get to know her better', try to build a connection with her based on shared interests or experiences. Ask her about her favorite books, movies, or hobbies. Show genuine interest in her life and see where it takes you. And remember, it's okay if it doesn't work out - there are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."
3. **u/awkward_situations**: "OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before and it's always nerve-wracking. But here's the thing: people can usually tell when you're being genuine or insincere. So, just be yourself and don't try to be someone you're not. If she's interested, she'll let you know. And if she's not, well, that's okay too. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your advice! I think I was overthinking things and making it way too complicated. I'll try to just be friendly and genuine, and see where it takes me. And if it doesn't work out, I'll just shrug it off and move on. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: I [24,f] want to be friends with my best friend from HS [m, 24], but don't know how to without leading him on.

POST: My friend traveled around the world in the 6 years since HS and we didn't talk much. He recently moved back to our hometown, which gave us the opportunity to hang out this weekend over the holiday. Before I saw him in person we had started texting a bit. It was pretty harmless, but it is clear that he still as feelings for me. When we hung out this weekend it was a bit awkward. I'm not sure if that's because he's not as into me as he thought (I suspect he held onto strong feelings form HS that may or may not hold now) or maybe it was uncomfortable because he does still have feelings for me. Maybe it's something else...?

So now I'm unsure about how about to handle this. I'd like to continue talking to him, but I also don't want to give him false hope. If it's possible, how do I nurture a friendship without leading him on? Do I let him be the first to call or text? If he cares about me it seems shitty to never initiate contact, but then again this may make him feel false hope... Is this even possible?

I should also note a couple things. There is another female in his life, but she is in another state and they're not in a committed relationship. Also, my partner of 7 years [m, 24] knows that we've been talking and that I hung out with him over break. He is totally find with me talking and hanging out with him.

TL;DR: I want to be friends with my HS best friend, but I don't know how to do it without leading him on. He still has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way. How do I nurture a friendship without giving him false hope?

TITLE: Me [24F] with my bf [24 M] 3 years, Am I wrong to be confused at why he didnt walk the dog?

POST: MY bf of 3 years are going through a timeoff, my intentions was for me to decide if I wanted to leave or stay. We are 5 days since he moved out. Today he offers to walk the dog while I'm at work. I told him he didnt need to, he insisted.   

So i've walked the dog at 9 am. He comes over at 3 in the afternoon, and instead of walking the dog right away he stays plays with the dog for a bit and plays computer games for 2 hours. 
He only takes the dog for a walk at close to 6 pm and only for 10 mins.   

So I asked im Why did'nt he take the dog to pee right away. He said lazy, it was hot, he played with the dog. He says im not appreciative at all that he made all this effort. I said I dont understand why you let the dog wait 8 hours to pee when you were there earlier. 

He starts saying im domineering, says fuck a lot, tells me i have to always do things my way. Tells me he doesnt deserve this treatment. If I want to do things my way,I should do it myself.

TL;DR: Bf of 3 years moves out, offers to walk the dog, but instead of doing it immediately, plays with the dog and computer games for 2 hours, then takes the dog for a 10-minute walk. I'm confused and frustrated, he says I'm domineering and unappreciative.

---

This post is a great example of how a seemingly trivial issue can escalate into a larger problem in a relationship. The OP is frustrated that her boyfriend didn't take the dog for a walk immediately, and instead spent time playing with the dog and computer games. She feels that he didn't prioritize the dog's needs and is confused as to why he didn't do it right away.

The boyfriend's response, however, reveals a deeper issue. He accuses the OP of being domineering and unappreciative, and implies that she is trying to control him. He also tells her that she should do things her way, implying that he doesn't want to compromise or communicate with her.

This exchange highlights a common problem in relationships: the lack of communication and understanding. The OP feels frustrated and confused, while the boyfriend feels belittled and unappreciated. This lack of communication can lead to feelings of resentment and anger, and can ultimately damage the relationship.

In this case, the OP is right to feel frustrated and confused, and the boyfriend is wrong to accuse her of being domineering and unappreciative. The boyfriend needs to understand that his actions have consequences and that he needs to communicate with his partner about his intentions and actions. The OP needs to understand that her boyfriend is not trying to be lazy or irresponsible, but rather is struggling with his own feelings of inadequacy and frustration.

Ultimately, this exchange highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. Couples need to be able to communicate effectively and understand each other's perspectives in order to build trust and intimacy. Without this communication, relationships can become strained and ultimately fail.

TITLE: Is it weird to find it hard to give sympathy?

POST: Kind of feeling like a psychopath here...A house burnt down in my town killing all but one survivor. I feel absolutely horrible for all involved but people in his neighborhood who saw the fire happening but aren't particularly close with the family, are up in arms, hysterical, etc. I look at them kind of wtf? They weren't primarily involved and I think it's very selfish of them to be so...affected? by something that doesn't directly have an impact on them. I understand they're upset naturally, but I feel they should be focusing on helping rather than crying. So am I some weird monster who can't feel empathy?

TL;DR: I feel bad for the family, but people in the neighborhood who aren't close to them are being super emotional and I think it's selfish. Am I a bad person for thinking this?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "You're not a bad person for thinking this, but you might be a bit... numb. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by tragedy, and people often react in different ways. It's not selfish to feel emotional, it's just a natural response to a traumatic event. You're right that people should focus on helping, but that doesn't mean they can't feel emotional about it too."
2. "I think you're misunderstanding the concept of empathy. Empathy isn't just about feeling the same emotions as someone else, it's about understanding and sharing their feelings. Just because you're not directly affected by the tragedy doesn't mean you can't feel empathy for the people who are. It's okay to acknowledge the pain and suffering of others, even if you're not experiencing it yourself."
3. "I think you're being a bit harsh on the people in the neighborhood. They're probably feeling a mix of emotions - shock, sadness, anger, etc. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by a tragedy, and it's not selfish to express those emotions. Maybe instead of focusing on what you think they should be doing, you could try to understand where they're coming from and offer support instead of judgment."
4. "I think you're missing the point of community. When something like this happens, it affects everyone in the community, not just the people directly involved. People are reacting because they're part of a community that's been shaken to its core. It's not about being selfish, it's about being human and feeling the impact of a tragedy."
5. "I think you're being a bit too critical of others. Maybe instead of focusing on what you think they should be doing, you could try to understand their perspective and offer support. Remember, everyone reacts differently to tragedy, and it's okay if you don't feel the same emotions as everyone else."

TITLE: Waiting on job offer after interview, need advice

POST: Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am having a bit of an anxiety fit over my current situation. If there is a more appropriate sub, please direct me to it.

I recently graduated from a specialized technical program and since graduating have had a ridiculous number of job offers and interview requests. I have actually turned down a number of interviews. 

I had a job lined up several months ago, but it was honestly not something I was very enthusiastic about, I only took the offer because they were the first to contact me and I was not sure what the job market in my field was like. We'll call then company A.

Long story short, I interviewed with another company last week, let's call them company B, and they exceeded all expectations and are basically a dream come true. They paid for my flight to their facility for the interview, put me up in a hotel and paid for a rental car. I had also previously turned in my notice with my current employer at the time, because company A, which I had already accepted an offer from, had expected me to start this coming week. I left the interview with company B feeling confident but without any offer in hand. Fast forward to today, I have notified company A that I won't be able to start with them and so am officially unemployed and awaiting some word from company B.

Am I insane to expect that company B is going to make some kind of offer? Should I be scrambling to find something solid? I have enough funds to keep me going for a few months if absolutely necessary.

To add some clarification, this is completely out of character for me, I have never left an employer without having a guaranteed job lined up already. I have no experience in this field but have a good amount of general management experience.

TL;DR: Had a job lined up, turned it down for a better opportunity, now waiting on an offer from that company and feeling anxious about the uncertainty.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not insane to expect an offer from company B, they went to the trouble of flying you out and putting you up in a hotel. It's likely they're serious about you joining their team."
* "I would say you're being reasonable to expect an offer, but also be prepared for the possibility that they might not come through. It's not uncommon for companies to take their time making decisions, especially if they're looking for the right fit."
* "I think you're being a bit too anxious about this. You've already turned down a job offer, so you're not in a bad position. Just take some time to relax and focus on your own job search. If company B doesn't come through, you'll find something else."
* "I would suggest following up with company B to express your interest in the position and ask about the status of your application. It's always better to be proactive and show that you're enthusiastic about the opportunity."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the uncertainty. Instead of worrying about what might happen, focus on what you can control. Keep your job search going and be prepared for any outcome. Remember that it's okay to not have a job lined up right away, it's not the end of the world."

**Advice:**

* Be prepared for the possibility that company B might not come through with an offer.
* Follow up with company B to express your interest in the position and ask about the status of your application.
* Keep your job search going and be prepared for any outcome.
* Focus on what you can control and don't get too anxious about the uncertainty.
* Remember that it's okay to not have a job lined up right away, it's not the end of the world.

TITLE: Reddit, my suite at college just got busted for a small party. I was in my room doing work not drinking, should I be reprimanded?

POST: There were approximately 15 people in the suite playing *water* pong and drinking a few beers, doing shots, playing music. All but 1 was underage. 

I was in my room doing work because I am a loser and have 3 tests on Monday to study for. 

The RA came in and said party's over and told them to dump the beer, wrote down everyones names, and told everyone who didn't live there to get out. 

She was REALLY nice about it and kept saying that we were all being really cooperative and polite and that would go on the report. 

There was a friend of ours who is an RA there who had just stopped by and got fucked by the timing. There was a girl who will probably get kicked off a sports team, and there was the guy who was 21 who could be in trouble for drinking with minors.
This is all of our first offense.

I talked to the RA personally and she said that if my roommates vouch for me not drinking and not being involved that will help my case, but I would probably get in trouble for just plain having knowledge of the party. But technically I never came out of the room for the one and a half hour that the party was going on for.

TL;DR: Suite party busted, I was in my room doing work, should I be reprimanded?

This post is an example of a common phenomenon on Reddit, where users share their personal stories and ask for advice from the community. In this case, the user is asking if they should be reprimanded for knowing about a party in their suite, even though they didn't participate in it.

The post has received a lot of engagement, with many users commenting and offering their opinions. Some users are saying that the user should be reprimanded for knowing about the party, while others are saying that they shouldn't be punished since they didn't participate in it.

Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be used as a platform for sharing personal stories and seeking advice from others. It also highlights the importance of community engagement and the value of sharing experiences with others.

TITLE: I need your help - met a 94 y/o woman who is awesome! but she does not have a shower!

POST: I was at the grocery doing some trading and while waiting for a friend started some idle conversation with an elderly lady. (my friend thought I had already gone, so we talked for a bit). Her parents lived till they were 105 - both of them! She is still kicking so much ass at life- She cooks her own meals, dresses her self, has a great short term and long term memory, still opens the window to yell at the punk kids w/ their loud music. This 94 y/o gal has been through depressions, wars, technological revolutions. she is so happy and sharp, so being a young man I asked her a few questions (how was your teens, travel, work,) one of which was "is there anything you miss" and she said well taking a shower. WTF! "I have a shower but dut to my arthritis I cant get my legs over the side of the tub, so I just use a warsh cloth... you get use to it after a few years" (she didn't smell so I guess she did a good job of it)... but this made me really sad. I talked to a guy who said if I can find out who owns the building he would call him and make the shower thing happen (walk in shower w/chair and hand rails etc). He knows most every one in town and can call in some favors. so thats where I intend to start - and if the landlord is a slum lord then I'll will find a way to acquire a walk in shower and install it myself! Can you help me find out who owns these apts? I've looked and asked around and... nothing. its gotta be public info some wheres... right?

TL;DR: Met a 94 y/o woman who is awesome, but she doesn't have a shower due to arthritis. I want to help her get a walk-in shower installed, but I don't know who owns the building. Can you help me find out?

TITLE: [15, almost 16/F] My boyfriend [17/M] and I need to find out how to sleep together in a bed.

POST: First off, I want to say that yeah, we're kinda young but we take naps together a lot. We're a lazy couple.

We're both used to sleeping on our stomachs or sides, but I'm finding it hard to find one position that works best. I hug things in my sleep, so spooning with him in the back doesn't really work unless I have an extra pillow, and we don't. However, when I'm in the back, I can't get my bottom arm under him without hurting his side (I have bony arms.) Us facing each other works for a bit, with him hugging me and me holding my arms between his and my chest, but he likes to surround me and I find myself running out of air. I can't think of any other position to sleep in except me lying on his chest, but last time we did that, we both got stomach aches. 

I'm hoping that this will help us out once he gets his own place and I start to spend the night there. If we're having troubles napping, I can only imagine how we're going to pull off sleep through the the whole night as well.

Thanks!

TL;DR: 15-year-old girl and her 17-year-old boyfriend are having trouble sleeping together in a bed due to their sleeping positions and habits.

* "Hey, I'm 16 and I've been in a similar situation with my boyfriend. We found that sleeping on our backs with our heads on the same pillow worked best for us.

TITLE: Me 18M and 17F girlfriend. Afraid to lose virginity. How can I help her not too freak out?

POST: I've been dating my girlfriend for eight months now and the topic of sex has come up quite a bit recently. She is really afraid of getting pregnant and she doesn't want to have sex yet. I'm not trying to convince her or push her or anything, I want her to be 100% comfortable when it happens. 
She is really afraid that she is going to freak out before it happens, or during. She says that it will happen and I've seen little freakouts from her if I get too close to her. I just really want to know how I can help her not freak out, or if she does, how to calm her down enough to continue and be comfortable.

Here's some background info if it helps.
 Her parents sheltered her from sex completely telling her it was bad and making it seem weird and out of place by not talking about it.

I've been helping her get over the "weirdness" of the sexual things we do and it is really hard, but we get by.

TL;DR: 18M and 17F girlfriend, afraid to lose virginity. How can I help her not freak out?

TITLE: How do you respectfully flirt with a woman?

POST: Lately I have seen a lot of posts about women getting creeped out by guys flirting with them, taking "no" to mean "yes" and similar things. I agree that women should feel more comfortable with rejecting advances, and all around should have way more freedom in our society to be individuals.

Now, I want to try and be a bit more flirtatious, my best friend who is just naturally friendly, is mock flirtatious with pretty much every guy and girl, and pretty much everyone loves him.

I'm not saying I want to try and be him. But I know that I pretty much never flirt because I feel like if I flirt at all or give any kind of compliment, it could be taken as "verbal abuse". For example, I say "Hey so and so, I love your hair, it looks really good". There was one time I actually just genuinely liked how a girl's hair looked, it was a unique color, and wanted to compliment her on it. I asked a female friend of mine who was nearby if it would be okay if I told the girl, and my friend says it would have been creepy.

TL;DR: I want to learn how to flirt respectfully and not come across as creepy. How do you do it?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think the key is to be genuine and respectful. If you're only trying to flirt because you think it's what you're supposed to do, it's going to come across as insincere. Instead, focus on finding things you genuinely appreciate about the person, and express those thoughts in a respectful and considerate way. For example, instead of saying 'you look really good in that dress', you could say 'I love the way you're expressing yourself through fashion, it's really inspiring'. This way, you're showing that you're paying attention to them as a person, rather than just their physical appearance."
2. **u/username123**: "I think it's also important to remember that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels when it comes to flirting. What might be okay for one person might not be okay for another. So, it's important to pay attention to the other person's cues and boundaries, and to respect them if they're not interested. You can also try asking someone if they're comfortable with you flirting with them, and if they say no, respect their decision and move on."
3. **u/anotherusername**: "I think it's also important to remember that flirting is not just about the other person, it's also about you. Make sure you're comfortable with yourself and your intentions before you start flirting. If you're only trying to flirt because you think it's what you're supposed to do, or because you're trying to impress someone, it's going to come across as insincere. Instead, focus on finding things you genuinely appreciate about the other person, and express those thoughts in a respectful and considerate way."
4. **u/yetanotherusername**: "I think it's also important to remember that flirting is not just about physical attraction, it's also about emotional connection. Try to find things you have in common with the other person, and express those things in a respectful and considerate way. For example, you could say 'I love your sense of humor, it's really refreshing'. This way, you're showing that you're interested in getting to know the other person as a person, rather than just their physical appearance."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's also important to remember that flirting is not a competition. It's not about trying to outdo the other person or prove something. Instead, it's about having a fun and respectful interaction with someone. So, try to relax and be yourself, and see where things go. And if the other person isn't interested, that's okay too. Just respect their decision and move on."

TITLE: [19f]Keeping an innocent (but somewhat significant) piece of information from my boyfriend of a few months [21m]...

POST: Honestly, I'm not sure how significant this piece of information is in the context of our relationship.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a few months now, and he doesn't know that the drunken dance-floor makeout we had a little over a year ago, the first time we met, was my first kiss.

I've kissed plenty of other people since then, so it's not like he's the only person I've ever kissed. I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. 

Basically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.

Should I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my "first" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. 

I'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer. The topic of first kisses may come up at some point before then, though.

TL;DR: I had my first kiss with my boyfriend at a party a year ago, but I haven't told him. Should I tell him, or keep it a secret? Would he find it funny or weird? Help me out!

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, I think it's not a big deal. You've had plenty of other kisses since then, and it's not like it's a huge secret. If he finds it weird, he's not the right guy for you."
* "I think it's a nice little tidbit to share with him, but maybe not right now. You don't want to make it seem like you're trying to make a big deal out of it. Maybe wait until you've been together for a bit longer and you can bring it up casually."
* "I would tell him. It's a fun little piece of trivia, and it shows that you're willing to be open and honest with him. Just be prepared for him to be a little surprised or even embarrassed, but I think it could bring you closer together."
* "I think it's a bit weird that you're keeping it from him. If you're not planning on making a big deal out of it, then why not just tell him? It's not like it's a huge secret or anything. Maybe you're just worried about how he'll react, but honestly, if he's the right guy for you, he'll understand and appreciate your honesty."
* "I would wait until you've been together for a bit longer. You don't want to bring it up too early in the relationship and make it seem like you're trying to make a big deal out of it. Plus, you never know how he'll react, and you don't want to risk making things awkward between you two."

TITLE: People who have posted about issues regarding SO's past: do you ever get over it?

POST: From the very beginning of our relationship a year ago, bf [25] was uncomfortable with my [23] sexual/dating history.  Complete double standards.  I've done nothing he hasn't, and he's been with a lot more people.  But he's always recognized that he's being irrational and that it's something he needs to get over.  But we don't know what to do to help him get over this, and whenever we talk about it it only makes it worse.  It's been a year and he insists he still needs more time to even know if it's possible.  At what point do I walk?

TL;DR: SO has been uncomfortable with my past sexual history for a year, despite recognizing it's irrational. We've tried talking about it, but it only makes it worse. At what point do I walk?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: I think it's great that your SO recognizes that his discomfort is irrational. That's a huge step. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation about how his behavior is affecting you? It might help him understand that his past is not the issue, but the way he's handling it is.
2. **skeptical_sarah**: I'm a bit surprised that your SO hasn't made any progress in a year. It's possible that he's not willing to work on himself and his issues. Have you considered couples therapy to help him work through his feelings and insecurities?
3. **relationship_rant**: I'm so tired of people expecting their partners to "get over" their past. It's not about the past, it's about the present and the future. If your SO is still struggling with this after a year, it's likely a sign that he's not ready for a committed relationship. You deserve better than someone who can't accept you for who you are.
4. **honest_hannah**: I think it's important to remember that everyone has their own pace and timeline for healing and growth. It's possible that your SO is still working through his own issues and needs more time. However, it's also important to prioritize your own needs and feelings. If you feel like you're stuck in this limbo and it's affecting your relationship, it might be time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you.
5. **realistic_rachel**: I think it's great that you're considering walking away. It's not fair to stay in a relationship where you're constantly feeling like you're walking on eggshells. You deserve someone who accepts and loves you for who you are, past and all. Don't settle for someone who's still struggling with their own issues. You're worth more than that.

---

**Key themes:**

1. The importance of open and honest communication in relationships
2. The need for self-reflection and personal growth in overcoming past issues
3. The importance of prioritizing one's own needs and feelings in a relationship
4. The potential for relationships to be unhealthy or toxic if one partner is not willing to work through their issues
5. The importance of self-worth and self-respect in making decisions about one's relationships.

TITLE: [24f] having trouble bringing up the status of my relationship with the older [32] guy I'm seeing

POST: So. I've been seeing a guy now for a few months. I met him right as I was getting out of a messy relationship that really fucked with my head. But he's made me so happy since I've started seeing him and I can really see a future with him. But we haven't yet talked about where we see this going. We've both said we aren't sleeping with other people, but we haven't yet said whether or not we want to be in a relationship. I'm having trouble bringing up the subject. Mostly because my last relationship ended so badly and it makes me nervous to let someone else in. I'm also worried that our age difference might be too much for him because every once in a while he'll make a joke about how young I am. 

I know that being scared to have this conversation seems stupid and most of you will probably think that I shouldn't be with someone I can't have this conversation with. But I guess I just can't decide if having this talk after only a couple months is rushing into something or if I'm going to sound crazy. I guess I just need a pep talk or something. Any advice is greatly appreciated

TL;DR: 24f dating 32m, having trouble bringing up the status of our relationship, worried about age difference and past relationship trauma

RESPONSES:

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm 25f and I've been in a similar situation with a 35m. I totally get where you're coming from. It's normal to be nervous about bringing up the subject, especially after a bad experience. But here's the thing: if you're not having this conversation, you're not going to know where you stand with him. And if you're not on the same page, it could lead to some serious misunderstandings down the line. I think it's better to be honest and upfront about your feelings and concerns. Just be prepared for him to have his own thoughts and feelings on the matter. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll know where you stand and can move on. Good luck!"

2. **skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the age difference is a big deal. I'm not saying it's impossible to make it work, but it's definitely something you should consider. Have you talked to him about how he feels about the age difference? Does he see it as a big deal or is it just a joke to him? You need to have that conversation and see where he's at. And honestly, if he's not willing to have that conversation with you, it might be a sign that he's not serious about you. Just something to think about"

3. **relationship_ruth**: "OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's normal to take time to figure things out, especially after a bad experience. And honestly, it's not like you're asking him to propose or anything. You're just having a conversation about where you stand. I think it's great that you're thinking about this and wanting to be honest with him. Just remember that it's okay to take things slow and figure things out as you go. And hey, even if it doesn't work out, you'll be better off for having had the conversation and knowing where you stand. Good luck, OP!" 

4. **jaded_jen**: "OP, I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit skeptical about this whole situation. I mean, you're 24 and he's 32 - that's a pretty big age difference. And you're worried about his jokes about your age? That's not a good sign. I think you need to take a step back and reevaluate whether this relationship is really worth your time and energy. You deserve someone who takes you seriously and doesn't make jokes about your age. Just something to think about"

5. **optimistic_olivia**: "OP, I'm so glad you're thinking about having this conversation! It's amazing that you're taking the time to consider your feelings and concerns. I think it's great that you're thinking about the future and what you want. Just remember that it's okay to be nervous, but don't let fear hold you back. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship. Go for it, OP! You got this!" 

Note: The responses are a mix of advice, concerns, and encouragement. Some users are more skeptical about the age difference, while others are more optimistic about the relationship. The OP is seeking a pep talk and advice on how to bring up the subject with their partner. The responses range from telling the OP to be honest and upfront to being more cautious and considering the potential risks of the relationship. Overall, the subreddit provides a supportive and honest space for the OP to share their concerns and receive advice from others who have been in similar situations.

TITLE: Me [32 M] with my girlfriend [30 F] of 1 1/2 years, found her online dating profile, not sure what to do

POST: I've been seeing this girl for 1 1/2 years, mostly long distance.  Recently found her facebook and while digging around I found an online dating profile with pictures of her.  After confronting her on the phone and skype, she tearfully said her sister made the profile without her knowledge.  But most of the pictures on her profile is not on her FB and the description on the profile sounds uncannily like her.  Like the writing style is like hers.

Honestly, I never thought of her as the type to cheat on me.  But when I read the profile, I didn't have any doubts it's her.  Also, why would her 26 year old sister, married with children, want to create a fake online dating profile with her older sister's photos?  I can't explain it and neither could she.

Never thought this would happen (again) in my life.  You'd think by the time people hit their 30's this shit would stop.  Why do I feel like I'm still in high school.  Fucking relationships suck ass.

Now I'm not sure what to do.  I think I should just dump her and move on.  Having a hard time believing she'd do this, but I'm also having a hard time believing her sister would do this.  I need some advice reddit.

TL;DR: Found girlfriend's online dating profile with pictures of her, she says her sister made it without her knowledge, but I'm not sure what to believe.  Help me out.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're not stupid for feeling this way. You've been hurt before, and now you're wondering if you're just a pawn in some game. I'd say take a step back and assess the situation. Ask her more questions, see if she's willing to work through this with you. But also, don't be afraid to walk away if you don't feel like you can trust her."
2. **RelationshipExpert**: "I'm a relationship expert, and I gotta say, this is a red flag. Even if her sister did make the profile without her knowledge, the fact that she didn't notice or report it is a major issue. It's like she's not taking her relationship with you seriously. I'd say take some time to think about whether you want to continue this relationship. You deserve better than someone who's not fully invested in you."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I'm not buying the'sister did it without her knowledge' excuse. If that's the case, why didn't her sister get in trouble for it? Why didn't she report it to Facebook? It sounds like a bunch of BS to me. I'd say take a hard look at your relationship and decide if you're willing to work through this. If not, it might be time to move on."
4. **HonestyIsTheBestPolicy**: "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings. Tell her how you're feeling, and ask her to explain why she didn't notice the profile or report it. If she's willing to work through this with you, then maybe you can move forward. But if she's not willing to be honest and transparent, then it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit is divided on the issue, with some users advising the OP to take a step back and assess the situation, while others are more skeptical of the girlfriend's excuse and think the OP should consider moving on. The general consensus is that honesty and transparency are essential in any relationship, and if the OP doesn't feel like he can trust his girlfriend, then it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years, have different sleep patterns - says im selfish

POST: I've been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years and we recently bought our own house and moved in at Christmas.

I've always ran on about 6 - 7 hours sleep, and prior to moving in, I'd always do my own thing when I got home.  I'd play games, learn some code until I was tired which was usually until about half 12.  

My girlfriend is always tired and wakes up early for her job, she's usually up at 7 and out of the house by 8.  She goes to bed at 10:30 so gets about 8 - 9 hours sleep a night.

I've been trying to get into this sleep pattern, but I just find myself lying awake at night or being shattered the next day from too much sleep.

I'm wanting to spend some time playing some games, and with most people my age, the only time we get is later at night - hence the reason I was usually playing games from about 10 - 12:30.

Now we're living together, she complains that I either wake her up because she's a light sleeper, and how it's unfair for me to go to bed later because I should be thinking about her.

Personally I think this is wrong to simply demand this, but she's as stubborn as they come, and trying to talk sense into her just results in an argument.  I've tried explaining the above, or using the fact that when she wakes up in the morning, her alarm wakes me up, as does her getting dressed etc so I end up waking up an hour earlier due to her.  

I should add that I work from home in a stressful job, but she uses this as an excuse as to why I should respect her sleeping hours and go to bed at the same time (even if i lie awake for hours).  I can't go to bed later, I can't use my laptop in bed to code, yet she has to have the TV on to go to sleep to (I can't stand this)

I don't really know how else to tackle it, as everything gets turned into me being the bad guy and its all about her

TL;DR: I'm 28, my girlfriend is 24, we've been together for 5 years. We have different sleep patterns. I get 6-7 hours sleep, she gets 8-9. I want to spend time playing games, but she says I'm selfish and wake her up. I've tried explaining, but she's stubborn and it always ends in an argument.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're trying to find a compromise, but she's not willing to listen. Maybe try setting boundaries and communicating your needs clearly. You can't control her sleep schedule, but you can control how you spend your time."
* "I'm a light sleeper too, and I understand how frustrating it can be. Have you tried talking to her about finding a compromise? Maybe you can find a time that works for both of you to spend together, like having a movie night or something?"
* "I think it's unfair to expect you to change your sleep schedule just because your girlfriend has a different one. You're an adult, and you should be able to make your own decisions about how you spend your time. Maybe it's time to have a serious conversation with her about what you're comfortable with and what you're not."
* "I think you're being really reasonable here. It's not selfish to want to spend time doing things you enjoy, and it's not fair to expect you to change your sleep schedule just because your girlfriend has a different one. Maybe you should try setting some boundaries and communicating your needs clearly. You can't control her sleep schedule, but you can control how you spend your time."
* "I think you should try to find a compromise. Maybe you can find a time that works for both of you to spend together, like having a movie night or something. And maybe you can try to find ways to make your girlfriend feel more comfortable with your gaming habits, like turning off the TV or using headphones."
* "I think it's time for you to have a serious conversation with your girlfriend about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. You can't control her sleep schedule, but you can control how you spend your time. Maybe it's time to set some boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice your own needs to make your girlfriend happy."

TITLE: Me [21 M] broken up about break up with girl [21 F]

POST: I have already posted about this girl previously but just for quick background, we have known each other a while, dated for about 4-5 months, although she has had feelings for about a year. A few days ago she ended things with me and I suppose I am writing this more to vent, since I was numb to the break up until today.

For a few weeks before I could tell she was pulling away. She said she felt pressured into being official, and was scared due to a very large amount of outside stress, mainly due to her grandmother being very sick in the hospital for months. About 2 weeks ago we had a large fight, where she was very iffy about making plans for a date and I was annoyed because she had been flakey about dates recently. We talked a few days ago and she said that she had intended to give it time and see where it went but after that fight she suddenly lost feelings.

Being honest, I am devastated. I had fallen hard for this girl and the idea that I had pressured her into things and caused her to lose feelings is a tough pill to swallow. That being said, I doubt there is much I can do to "fix" things and try again, and she is so guilty about hurting me I doubt she would even tell me if she did still have feelings or redeveloped them. Still, any advice, comments, words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: 21M, 21F broke up after 4-5 months, she had feelings for a year, but after a fight she lost feelings due to outside stress and pressure. I'm devastated and unsure what to do.

COMMENT 1:

Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your break up. It sounds like you two had a really tough time and it's no wonder she ended things. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your part in the fight and the pressure you may have put on her. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize that.

As for what to do, I think you should focus on taking care of yourself right now. It's okay to be devastated, but try not to dwell on what could've been or what you could've done differently. Instead, focus on what you can control - your own emotions and actions.

It might be helpful to talk to friends or family about what you're going through. Sometimes just sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can help you process and move forward. And who knows, maybe you'll find someone even better suited for you in the future.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Break ups are tough, but they're a part of life. You'll get through this, and you'll come out stronger on the other side.

TITLE: TIFU by letting my 7 year old sister crash her friend's go kart into his dad's porsche.

POST: I'll start off by giving you a little background.  I am 16, and my little sister is 7.  She was bored and wanted to go hang out at her friend's house down the street.  So I took her there.

When we got there, her friend insisted on showing me his new go kart. So I said sure.  We went to his garage, and he showed me his go kart.  I asked if I can try it out and he said sure. I rode it around for about a minute and then got off.

Then my sister asked if she can try it. I was skeptical at first because she's never driven anything like this.  But then I thought, *"It has four wheels. It's not like she's gonna flip it or anything."*

So I told her she can. I showed her all the controls. How to steer, how to go, and how to brake. Then I step away and let her go.

She then proceeded to drive straight into a Porsche. Her friend's dad's Porsche.  Everyone freaked out, and ran inside to tell him.  And to make matters worse, they exaggerated a lot and told him the scratch was ***huge*** and she was going ***super fast*** when she crashed into it.

The dad was super nice about it, but I felt guilty as fuck. I said sorry multiple times. And I told my sister to apologize but she never did.

Then about 20 minutes later as we were leaving, I told my sister to go say thank you for all the snacks they gave her and for being so cool about everything.  But instead of saying thank you, she started crying because she didn't want to go. The crying then turned into screaming and yelling and calling me names.  I finally had to carry her out of there because she refused to leave.  I kept on apologizing as we were leaving.

I've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life.

TL;DR: I let my 7 year old sister drive a go kart and she crashed it into her friend's dad's Porsche. I felt super guilty and embarrassed.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a story about a mistake they made and how it turned out badly. In this case, the author's 7-year-old sister crashed a go-kart into her friend's dad's Porsche, causing a scene and leaving the author feeling guilty and embarrassed. The post is relatable and entertaining, and the author's self-deprecation and willingness to share their mistake make it a great example of a TIFU story.

TITLE: GF of 5 years probably moving away, wants me to go but I said no.

POST: A little bit of history: I'm 23/m she's 22/f and we have been together on and off for 5-6 years now. This girl is my best friend and I will probably always love her no matter how things end up. She graduates from school in a few months and has this really great chance for a 1yr + internship in Boston, NY, or NJ (we currently live on the western part of the country) and may end up staying out of state beyond the 1yr if she finds a grad school she likes out there. Now the hard thing is that she wants me to move with her to where ever she ends up going and I flat out told her I wasn't comfortable with that **at all!** I don't even feel comfortable with moving in with her right now let alone leaving everything else behind to move across the country. I told her to go if she gets the opportunity because I'll be damned if I'm the thing to hold her back. The hard part about this is that we already tried the long distance thing at the beginning of her schooling 4 years ago and ended up breaking up for the first year that she was gone. She wants to go and would be willing to try the long distance thing again and keeps asking about my thoughts on doing LDR again. She also wants to try even though she seem hopeful it would work based on past experience and quite frankly I don't even want to try a LDR again (horrible shit). Every time she brings it up she basically leaves the decision on me about what we are going to do and I don't know what to do Reddit. Every time I think about it, something in me can't help but start counting down to the (final) end of our relationship even though I don't want it to end. Any advice? (sorry for the giant wall of text) and I will be happy to clarify anything if need be. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: GF of 5 years wants me to move with her to the East Coast for a 1yr internship, but I'm not comfortable with it. She's also open to trying long distance again, but I don't want to. I feel like I'm being put in a tough spot and don't know what to do.

RESPONSES:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're being very reasonable. You've already tried the long distance thing and it didn't work out. You're not obligated to uproot your life for someone else's career goals. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and boundaries. It's better to be upfront and clear about what you're comfortable with rather than leading her on or making promises you can't keep."
* "I think you're being very selfish here. Your girlfriend is making a huge sacrifice for her career and you're not willing to make any sacrifices for her. It's not just about you, it's about the relationship and what you're willing to do to make it work. If you're not willing to move with her, then maybe you're not as invested in the relationship as you think you are."
* "I think you're being very reasonable and it's not selfish at all. You've already tried the long distance thing and it didn't work out. You're not obligated to make the same sacrifices again. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and boundaries. It's better to be upfront and clear about what you're comfortable with rather than leading her on or making promises you can't keep."
* "I think you should consider what you want for your future. Do you want to be in a relationship where you're constantly apart from each other? Do you want to be in a relationship where you're making sacrifices for each other? If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship and see if it's really worth it for you. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires and to make decisions that are best for you, even if it means ending the relationship."

However, most people agree that it's important to have an open and honest conversation with the girlfriend about his feelings and boundaries. Some people also suggest that the OP should consider what he wants for his future and whether he wants to be in a relationship where he's constantly apart from his partner. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and what he feels is best for him and his relationship.

TITLE: TIFU and flooded my bathroom

POST: This happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the mood for a hot, foamy bath. I go into the bathroom, hop into the tub, add some bath salts (and no, I'm not craving for human flesh) and some of that thing that produces foam (I'm not English, sorry!) and lay on my back, eyes closed.

I should mention by now that our drain plug is chipped and lets water leak from the tub into the drain, so I usually take it out and put a plastic bag. It worked like a charm. Until today.

After 2-3 minutes, I hear bubbles in the secondary drain (the one on the floor made to prevent floods. Ironic, huh?) and realize that the water was at half the original level.

No biggie. I reach for the plastic bag to adjust it and realize that it'a gone. I look to the bathroom floor only to see it entirely flooded. The plastic bag was sucked into the drain and clogged it. By now, the tub was empty. I jumped out and ran to grab some towels. To my relief, the bag was flushed down and the water started going down the drain.

But I didn't finish bathing. And guess what? No hot water left. After a manly cold bath, I get out, dry myself and prepare for the worst. 

My house has a pretty weird structure. It's made by two buildings. One hosts the bedrooms and living-room, and the other hosts the kitchen and bathroom. They are connected, but there is no door between. From one to the other is a 10 meter walk. And I had to walk slowly since the ground was frozen, and it was cold as fuck outside. 

Now you may be wondering why I bathed in cold water instead of showering tomorrow morning. It's because my overly-protective parents forbid me from bathing/showering immediately before going out to prevent me from catching a cold.

TL;DR: I flooded my bathroom, clogged the drain, and had to take a cold bath. And now I have to walk 10 meters in the cold to get to the other building. I'm a genius.

TITLE: Reddit, BT is trying to charge my family £140 because the phone+hub they have given to us has failed. it has never worked from the day we have had it, and we pay line rental fee's for the phone but can't use it.

POST: BT provided us with a "homehub" (router) which has a built in phone. The phone has never worked, and yet we can only use that phone to get the 'free' calls that we pay for. Because it doesn't work it means we have to use a second phone, which means we receive very high charges.

My father called BT support up and asked them if they could repair it and, failing that, replace it, because the damage is nothing to do with us, and any and all filters on the phone have been checked and replaced, yet still nothing. They said "we will repair the phone happily, just pay us £140 and we will send out an engineer"

Obviously we don't want this, we would rather just have a new hub, i mean it has to be cheaper for both sides for them to just replace it? it must cost them what, £40 to produce?

anyway, down to the point, they aren't budging, is there anything anyone could suggest we do to make the robbing bastards give us what we pay (heavily) for?

TL;DR: BT is trying to charge us £140 to repair a phone that has never worked, despite paying line rental fees for it. We just want a new hub, is there anything we can do?

---

This post is an example of a common issue that many people face when dealing with customer service and trying to resolve a problem with a company. The OP (original poster) is frustrated and feels that BT is being unfair and trying to take advantage of them by charging a large amount of money to repair a phone that has never worked.

The post is seeking advice and suggestions from the Reddit community on how to resolve the issue and get a new hub without having to pay the £140 repair fee. The OP is looking for creative solutions and is willing to consider any ideas that might help them get what they pay for.

The post has received many comments and suggestions from the Reddit community, including:

* "Have you tried contacting Ofcom? They might be able to help you resolve the issue."
* "Have you tried negotiating with BT? Sometimes they can be flexible if you explain the situation clearly."
* "You could try contacting a local MP or councillor to see if they can help you get a new hub."
* "Have you tried contacting a different department within BT? Sometimes different departments have different policies."
* "You could try contacting a consumer advocacy group, such as Which?, for help and advice."

Overall, the post is an example of how the Reddit community can come together to help people resolve issues and find creative solutions to problems. It also highlights the importance of being persistent and seeking help when dealing with customer service and trying to resolve a problem with a company.

TITLE: TIFU by trusting a fart.

POST: This just happened. I don't write very well, so please excuse my grammar. 

We'll start off with my morning. I wake up late for work. Had to be at work for 0730, woke up at 0710. I work for an ambulance service as an EMT and I am currently in paramedic school doing clinicals every other day I'm not working a 24 hour shifts on the boo boo bus. So I'm rushing around trying to get my uniform together when I fell a dart brewing. Ok seems innocent enough. No. It was a bubble of doom. I knew instantly as it was coming out that it was too late and I had just destroyed a nice fresh pair of boxers. So the boxers get thrown away and now I'm wasting even more time sitting on the toilet. My bowels are doing back flips and now I'm even more late for work. So I finish as fast I could then frantically find a new pair boxers and finish getting my shit together and get out the door for a 20 min drive to work. 

When I get to work I remembered I keep a bottle of pepto bismol in my box. Thinking it would help settle my stomachs and colon I decide to take some. Well that was possibly the worst idea I could of had st the time. Someone had decided to play a joke on me and put hot sauce in my medicine. Instant burning all the way down. My stomach is now doing front flips and back flips and side flips and any other flip you could possible image. Now I need to vomit. Made it in time to the bathroom luckily. That pepto was the only thing I had in my stomach and it felt like I was spewing hell fire. Now I like some spice here and there but this was hot hot. Not a flavor hot. So now I feel even worse and I just started my 24 hour shift. Yay.

TL;DR: I trusted a fart and it led to a series of unfortunate events, including a destroyed pair of boxers, a rushed morning, and a nasty case of stomach burning from hot sauce in my Pepto Bismol.

This post has received over 10,000 upvotes and over 1,000 comments, with many users sharing their own stories of similar mishaps. The post has also been featured on the subreddit's "Best of" page. The story has become a meme, with many users referencing the "bubble of doom" and the "hot sauce in my Pepto Bismol" as a cautionary tale about the dangers of trusting one's bodily functions.

TITLE: Drama with my BF's roommates

POST: My boyfriend lives with four other guys, one of whom he shares a room, Max. A few days ago, we got into a heated argument that almost resulted in us breaking up. We didn't because most of the issues we have  are because of Max, a 22 year old stoner who spends the majority of his day playing video games. Max does not have a job, go to class, and lives off of his parents money, most of which goes to weed and eating out. Because of Max's influence, my boyfriend has started gaming and smoking more. At Max's request, I've stopped coming over as much and doing certain things that bother him, such as coming in from the backdoor, knocking on the window to have someone unlock the door, bringing over extra changes of clothes, etc. All of these requests are reasonable enough but they have brought stress onto my relationship nonetheless. Other than that, we get along OK.

While my boyfriend and I were fighting, I called Max "a useless piece of shit." It was unnecessary and I certainly regret it, but it was honest. However, though we were outside, one of my boyfriend's other roommates overheard when he came to smoke a cigarette and told Max what I said. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but obviously that's what he would like me to do.

So here's my issue: I don't mind apologizing to Max but I feel like the informant roommate shouldn't have said anything to Max in the first place. My words weren't meant for other people and the other roommate knows that Max and I get along for the most part. Do I have a right to be angry at the other roommate?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's roommate Max is a stoner who doesn't contribute to the household and is influencing my boyfriend to be more like him. I called Max a useless piece of shit during an argument with my boyfriend, but one of his roommates overheard and told Max. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize, but I feel like the other roommate shouldn't have said anything. Do I have a right to be angry at the other roommate?

---

This post is a great example of how drama can arise in relationships, even when it's not directly related to the couple. The OP's frustration with Max's behavior and influence on her boyfriend is understandable, and her regret over calling him a useless piece of shit is also relatable. The issue now is whether she should apologize to Max, and whether she has a right to be angry at the other roommate for sharing the information.

The comments on this post are varied, with some people agreeing with the OP and others suggesting that she should apologize to Max regardless of the circumstances. Some commenters also offer advice on how to handle the situation, such as talking to her boyfriend about her feelings and concerns, or finding ways to distance herself from Max's negative influence.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication and boundaries in relationships, and how external factors can sometimes create tension and conflict. It also shows how the internet can be a valuable resource for people to share their experiences and get advice from others who may have gone through similar situations.

TITLE: I (22 M) like everything about this woman (23 F) but her weight.

POST: Backstory: I'm originally from Maryland, but I just came back from doing a summer internship in Boston. In late July, I met this woman from OKC.. we were sexting pics within a couple days of first contact and at first I thought all this was going to be was a hookup because of the way things started. When I first saw her in real life she ended up being a lot bigger than I anticipated and I quickly noted that she was not my ideal body type but I still enjoyed the sex.

After sex, we just laid on my bed and talked for about 3-4 hours. We found that we had a lot in common and I realized that I actually enjoyed her company. She even bought me Chipotle afterwards. We decided we wanted to keep seeing each other, even though we both knew that I had to go back home to Maryland soon to finish up my last year of school. 

Fast forward to last week (Aug 24), she ends up coming down to visit me for the week at my parents' place in Maryland (where I'm staying for the next 2 semesters). She's met my parents and sister.

Basically, I find that I really enjoy her company, her personality, the way she supports me in my hobbies/aspirations.. everything except her body type. We have TONS of sex (2-3 times a day) but one time I couldn't finish and she asked if I thought she was unattractive and honestly I don't really find her body attractive but I think she has a gorgeous face. Of course I didn't tell her this I just said that I think she is beautiful. 

I like everything about this woman except her weight. She is about 5'6 and 155 and I am that same weight but I am 5'9. Sometimes I feel like I'm settling in the looks department (is this shallow?) because up until this point in my life I've only dated skinny/athletic women. Am I just scared about what my friends will think about her weight? 

I don't want to just cut her off since I really do like her but her weight bothers me slightly. What should I do?

TL;DR: I met a woman who I really enjoy, but she's not my ideal body type. I'm torn between my feelings for her and my reservations about her weight.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: the struggle to reconcile one's feelings with societal beauty standards. The OP (original poster) is torn between his attraction to the woman's personality and his discomfort with her weight. He is unsure of how to navigate this issue and is seeking advice from the Reddit community.

The post highlights the importance of self-reflection and honesty in relationships. The OP needs to confront his own biases and insecurities about body type and consider whether his feelings are based on genuine attraction or societal pressure. He also needs to consider how his partner might feel about his reservations and whether he is willing to work through these issues together.

The post also raises questions about the impact of societal beauty standards on relationships. The OP's discomfort with his partner's weight is likely influenced by societal norms that emphasize thinness and athleticism. This highlights the need for a more inclusive and accepting approach to beauty and body image.

Overall, this post is a relatable and thought-provoking example of the challenges that can arise in relationships when societal beauty standards conflict with personal feelings and values.

TITLE: Looking for a Good Cat Feeder/Toy

POST: Hey everyone!  I need some help.  Me and my girlfriend have two cats who have gotten a little food obsessed.  They were both kinda fat at one point so we, with the advice of our vet, put them on a diet of organic wet food (we use Prowl, the dehydrated stuff that you add water to).

Well, they're getting a little obnoxious now.  We used to keep their food on top of the fridge, but once they went on a diet they figured out how to climb up on top of the fridge, knocked the box over and ate like a half a box of dehydrated cat food.  So, we moved it to our laundry room, on top of the washer/dryer combo.  If we ever left the door cracked they were up there again, tearing into the box.  The final straw came this weekend when we had left the door closed but they got it anyway!  How you ask?  Well we live in a loft, and they actually climbed on top of the bathroom (there's like four feet between the bathroom ceiling and the loft ceiling) found their way in the laundry room through the roof of the closet and tore open the box of food.

I think partly they need something to do!  We both work a lot and I take care of my grandma on the weekends so they're home alone a lot.  I want one of those toys that you can put treats in and they have to play with it to get them out.  I've tried Kong stuff, and while they love to play with the "snowman ball" they don't seem interested in/able to get out food I put in it (it came with some kind of salmon paste).  I need a good toy that will let a little food out at a time to keep their attention away from raiding the food box and keep them entertained while we're gone.  Anyone have something that works well for them?

Thanks in advance reddit!  :)

TL;DR: Two cats on a diet, getting bored and finding ways to get to their food.  Need a good toy that dispenses treats to keep them occupied while we're away.

**Comments:**

1. **u/CatLady99**: "Oh man, I can totally relate! My cat, Luna, used to be a food thief too. I got her a puzzle feeder that you can fill with treats and she has to figure out how to get them out. It's been a lifesaver! I recommend the Outward Hound Brick Puzzle Feeder. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it. You can also try the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball. It's a bit more affordable and still challenging for them."
2. **u/FelineFanatic**: "I've had great success with the Pet Zone Treat Wobbler. It's a treat-dispensing toy that you can fill with your cat's favorite treats. It's easy to clean and the cats love trying to figure out how to get the treats out. I also recommend the Catit Senses Food Maze. It's a bit more expensive, but it's a great way to challenge your cats and keep them occupied."
3. **u/CatDad**: "I've tried a few different treat-dispensing toys with my cat, Max, and the one that works the best for him is the West Paw Design Tux Interactive Dog Toy. It's designed for dogs, but cats love it too! It's easy to fill with treats and the cats have to figure out how to get them out. It's also very durable and easy to clean."
4. **u/CatMom**: "I've had good luck with the PetSafe SlimCat Interactive Toy. It's a slim, cylindrical toy that you can fill with treats and the cats have to figure out how to get them out. It's easy to clean and the cats love it. I also recommend the GoCat Da Bird. It's a feather toy that you can attach to a string and the cats have to figure out how to catch it. It's great exercise and entertainment for them."
5. **u/CatLover**: "I've tried a few different treat-dispensing toys with my cat, Whiskers, and the one that works the best for her is the Pet Zone Treat Wobbler. It's easy to fill with treats and the cats have to figure out how to get them out. It's also very durable and easy to clean. I also recommend the Catit Senses Food Maze. It's a bit more expensive, but it's a great way to challenge your cats and keep them occupied."

TITLE: having intense anxiety about possibly moving out, need advice

POST: Hello all,

So first of all thank you for reading this, now let's get into the meat of my dilemma

I'm currently going to college and my parents have graciously allowed me to live in their home while I'm going to college so I can save the maximum amount of money possible, for which I am very grateful. 

My father lost is Job about six months ago and has been vigorously looking for a new one. He recently has had two opportunities for employment come up. the problem is that one is in the middle of nowhere in the state we live in. They have invited me to go with them to which I have declined; I would like to stay in my current city and finish my degree. 

my anxiety has been running haywire.

logically I make enough money to live with a roommate, pay all of my bills, have extra fun money, and STILL save money. 

but my mind has been wracking itself with self deprecating thoughts and its honestly annoying. I was in the army and I managed just fine, so its not like I haven't been on my own before. I really don't know where this is coming from.  

I'll honestly be fine no what. I would honestly enjoy the option where my parents stay and I keep wracking up savings but I'm also fine with the other option as well, but my mind keeps telling me otherwise.

so I need your advice. How do I quell these thoughts of doom?

TL;DR: I'm having intense anxiety about possibly moving out and living on my own, despite being financially prepared and having experience living independently before. I need advice on how to calm my anxious thoughts.

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* "Hey OP, it sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of 'fear of the unknown'. It's normal to feel anxious about change, especially when it comes to living arrangements. Have you considered talking to a therapist about your anxiety? They can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. In the meantime, try to focus on the positive aspects of moving out and living on your own. You've already proven that you can do it before, and this time will be different. You'll have more independence and freedom, and you'll be able to build your own life. Remember that it's okay to be scared, but don't let fear hold you back from experiencing new things." - u/AnxiousAnnie
* "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I used to have similar anxiety about moving out and living on my own. But here's the thing: it's not as scary as it seems. You'll be fine, and you'll probably even enjoy it. Try to focus on the things that you're looking forward to, like having your own space and being able to do things on your own schedule. And remember that it's okay to make mistakes - it's all part of the learning process. You're not alone in this, and there are plenty of people who have gone through similar experiences and come out the other side just fine." - u/LivingOnMyOwn
* "Hey OP, I think you're selling yourself short. You're already financially prepared and have experience living independently, so you're definitely capable of handling this. Try to focus on the positive aspects of moving out and living on your own, like having more freedom and independence. And remember that it's okay to ask for help if you need it - whether it's from a therapist, a friend, or a family member. You got this, OP!" - u/PositiveVibesOnly
* "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're already doing great by saving money and being responsible, so don't be too hard on yourself. Try to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than worrying about the future. And remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time - you don't have to have all the answers right now. Just take it one day at a time and see where things go." - u/CalmAndCollected

TITLE: My [35f] ex [34m] is physically abusing his girlfriend [30somethingF]. Should I talk to her?

POST: My ex and I were together for six years, which culminated with him holding a gun to my head threatening to murder me while he was under the influence of a drug (MXE). He has a lot of mental health problems and the drug abuse certainly does not help. 

Since the end of our relationship three+ years ago, he's been in a relationship with one woman and told me that he had gotten clean, which I've since learned is a lie. We have very little contact. Last weekend a mutual friend was with the ex and his gf and he was intoxicated and choked his gf in front of other people. The gf said it's happened a number of times. The next morning when everyone was sober, the gf tried to brush it off and act like everything was fine. She lives with him with her two young children. He still has guns. I'm absolutely terrified for her. 

On one hand, it isn't any of my business. My life changed substantially for the better after getting out of the relationship with my ex and I don't want to involve myself in any drama. I dropped him and everyone associated with him (other than this one mutual friend) back then because of how messed up I was after the gun incident. On the other, I feel like I should tell her about what happened to me so that she knows exactly who she's dealing with (although she may already know). His behavior is clearly escalating, he has guns, and he's still abusing this drug. My current boyfriend, whose opinion I value immensely, says that I should leave it be, but he is obviously biased.

I can't look at this situation objectively. What, if anything, should I do?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend physically abuses his girlfriend, I'm torn between not wanting to get involved and feeling like I should warn her about his past behavior.

---

This post is a great example of a complex and sensitive situation. The OP (original poster) is torn between not wanting to get involved in their ex's life and feeling a sense of responsibility to warn his girlfriend about his past behavior. The OP's own experiences with their ex's abuse and manipulation make it difficult for them to remain objective.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the situation, including the OP's concerns and the opinions of their current boyfriend. The use of specific details, such as the gun incident and the mutual friend's account, helps to paint a vivid picture of the ex's behavior and the OP's emotional state.

The post also raises important questions about the role of bystanders in situations like this. Should the OP intervene and try to warn the girlfriend, or should they prioritize their own well-being and avoid getting involved? The post's title, "My [35f] ex [34m] is physically abusing his girlfriend [30somethingF]. Should I talk to her?", reflects the OP's uncertainty and desire for guidance.

Overall, this post is a great example of a complex and sensitive situation that requires careful consideration and empathy. The OP's concerns are valid, and the post's tone is reflective of the emotional turmoil they are experiencing. The post is likely to generate a thoughtful and supportive response from the community.

TITLE: Me [28 F] new at dating [30sM], when to start going dutch?

POST: Need some perspective! 

I've been in 2 long-term relationships since high school, so I've never really done the adult dating thing. I recently got out of my last one in the summer, and started casually dating in the fall. I've been having a lot of fun going on dates. For a while it was a string of first-dates and nothing serious, but recently I've been seeing a guy for a month and it's been going really well.

I enjoy spending time with him including going for dinners as we both are foodies, cooking dinner at his place, going out to the bar with his friends, that kind of thing. This past weekend he was acting off-standish and today he said that it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay. I mean I've paid for coffees and movie tickets and a few ones offs but when I thought about, I never did the whole fumbling-with-my-wallet thing very much. He would usually pick it up, but didn't say much after that. We talked it over and I told him of course I would pay for my share from now on. I wasn't even aware of it - I guess in my eyes, we weren't exclusive and if he wanted me to pick up my tab, he would have asked for separate bills or something to the tune of, "Let's split it." I would have been more than happy to - I'm not going out with him for the free ride.

I wanted to get some perspective from outsiders: is there a timeline when the girl should start paying? Is it right away, or after a month? Or totally depends on the guy?

TL;DR: I'm new to dating and recently started seeing someone for a month. He mentioned it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay, so I told him I'd start paying my share from now on. Is there a timeline for when the girl should start paying, or is it totally dependent on the guy?

---

**Top comments:**

* "There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but generally, it's considered polite to offer to pay or split the bill after 2-3 dates. You can also pay attention to the guy's cues. If he's always picking up the tab, you can start offering to pay or split it. If he's not, you can just assume it's on him. In your case, since you've been seeing him for a month, it's probably a good idea to start paying your share or offering to split the bill."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to pay your share! It's not about the money, it's about being considerate of the other person's feelings. You can start paying your share after a few dates, but it's also important to communicate with your partner about it. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking, and I'd like to start paying my share of the bill from now on. Is that okay with you?'"
* "I think you're being too focused on the 'when' and not enough on the 'why'. Why did he bring it up? Was it because he felt taken advantage of, or was it because he's trying to assert dominance? If it's the former, then it's a reasonable concern. If it's the latter, then you might want to reevaluate the relationship. Communication is key, so have an open and honest conversation about it."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to pay your share, but don't feel pressured to do it just because he mentioned it. You can still offer to pay or split the bill, but don't feel like you owe it to him. Remember, it's about being considerate of each other's feelings, not about who pays the bill."
* "I think it's a good idea to start paying your share after a few dates, but it's also important to communicate with your partner about it. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking, and I'd like to start paying my share of the bill from now on. Is that okay with you?' This way, you can avoid any misunderstandings and make sure you're both on the same page."

TITLE: My roommate is blackmailing my girlfriend and I over stupid shit. We've decided we're not going to take it; any ideas for payback.

POST: Throwaway account just in case.

Short story and context:

Girlfriend is here on a working holiday visa that was recently renewed. To renew said visa we had to call in a favor from a friend. Girlfriend being the trusting type she is told people she was close to including roommate (who up until recently was our friend) about the details of this process.

Situation in the house has been gradually deteriorating for a number of weeks due to silly reasons. Finally we decided to leave and look for our own place. Girlfriends birthday is coming up soon and I decided id like to throw a birthday party for her before leaving. Roommate was totally opposed to the situation, saying there was no day over the next 2 weeks this would be permissible because he had work and other plans blah blah blah. Situation escalated when he started aggressively demanding his way and I called him a tyrant. 

He threatened that if we even so much as have a single person over without his permission he'll go to immigration and try have her deported.

Unfortunately he's a bitter enough prick that I think this is a credible threat. My situation now is this: we have 2 weeks left till we move out, how can I fuck with him as much as possible and make him pay for being a vindictive asshole without him actually carrying out his threat.

TL;DR: Roommate is blackmailing us over stupid shit and we're not going to take it. We have 2 weeks left in the house and I want to make him pay for being a vindictive asshole without actually putting our girlfriend's visa at risk.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

1. "I'd suggest documenting everything, including dates, times, and details of the incidents. This will help you build a strong case if things escalate further. Also, consider talking to your girlfriend's friend who helped with the visa renewal and see if they can provide any support or guidance."
2. "Have you considered talking to the landlord about the situation? They may be able to help mediate the situation or even evict the roommate if he's causing problems."
3. "I'd recommend having a calm and rational conversation with the roommate about how his behavior is affecting you and your girlfriend. Try to avoid escalating the situation further and focus on finding a resolution that works for everyone."
4. "If the roommate is threatening to go to immigration, you may want to consider reporting him to the authorities for making false threats. This could potentially put him in a difficult position and make him think twice before making similar threats in the future."
5. "I'd suggest having a backup plan in place in case things don't go as planned. This could include having a plan for alternative accommodation or a plan for dealing with any potential consequences if the roommate does follow through on his threats."
6. "It might be worth considering having a quiet word with the roommate's friends or acquaintances to see if they're aware of his behavior and can help put a stop to it. Sometimes people don't realize the impact their friends are having on others."
7. "I'd recommend keeping a record of any communication with the roommate, including emails, texts, and conversations. This will help you track any patterns or inconsistencies in his behavior and provide evidence if needed."
8. "Have you considered involving your girlfriend's embassy or consulate in the situation? They may be able to provide guidance or assistance in dealing with the roommate's threats."
9. "I'd suggest trying to stay calm and composed in the face of the roommate's aggression. Avoid getting into arguments or confrontations, and focus on finding a resolution that works for everyone."
10. "It might be worth considering having a 'Plan B' in place in case things don't go as planned. This could include having a backup plan for accommodation or a plan for dealing with any potential consequences if the roommate does follow through on his threats."

These responses offer a range of advice, from documenting the situation and talking to the landlord to having a calm and rational conversation with the roommate and involving the authorities. They also suggest having a backup plan in place and keeping a record of any communication with the roommate. Overall, the responses aim to help the OP find a way to deal with the situation without putting their girlfriend's visa at risk.

TITLE: Reddit, a girl with a fake facebook identity is seducing unknown people on facebook for no reason. What should I do?

POST: So I was added as a friend on Facebook by a girl who looked very cute, but I didn't know her. I asked how she knew me, and she said she had made a mistake, and mid apology threw in, "you look cute." Basically we texted back and forth for a few days, and she was extremely, extremely flirty. My suspicious were halted when she would talk to me for 3-4 hours a night on the phone and text me virtually all day. 

I was suspicious, but she had a few hundred friends, a twitter account with a bunch of followers that tweeted at her, etc. It seemed legit, but I noticed one too many red flags.

Long story short, I got suspicious enough I did a few reverse image searches on Google, and sure enough she is using a fake name, has real pictures, but fake info, and has added enough friends to look legitimate. This is truly a work of art. She claimed to live about 45 minutes from me, go to my University, work in a city about an hour away, and even knew a bunch of stuff about our supposed mutual church, etc. Now I realize she lives in Texas, is in a sorority, and it's all lies.

TL;DR: Girl on Facebook is using fake identity, has real pictures, but fake info, and is seducing people for no reason. What should I do?

TITLE: My ex (F21) just broke up with me (M23) because she needed to find herself. But I still want her - how do I eventually get her back?

POST: So I (M23) had been dating her (F21) for two years. Recently, she had become immature and rude to me. She then went back to the US for Christmas break and days before she returned, she said she had to tell me something. She got back and said she went to a party, got black out drunk and was taken advantage of. I believe my ex 100%, but I feel this was just something extra she did to push her over the edge, to give her that excuse to say what she ultimately wanted which was to break up with me. Her rudeness and immaturity that had "developed" wasn't enough to push me away so that I would do the break up, so I guess I interpret this event of her getting taken advantage of as her excuse so that she could do it. When she told me this, I realised she was PARTLY the victim here and was turning to forgive her. But then I asked her if she still loved me and she said she didn't know. She said her views on what love were had changed, she didn't think it existed anymore and she felt she had completely changed. She said she had to find herself, go travelling, see the world and get some perspective. She comes from a very messed up family and suffers with anxiety issues so I understand that she needs to figure that out before she can be with someone. But I am not just losing my girlfriend, I am losing my best friend too and I do not want to lose both. I would love for her to come back to me as my girlfriend but obviously not until she has found herself. Can I still be friends with her while she tries to find herself? I don't want to completely lose her. If anyone has any like 5 steps plans or strategies, please, I would really appreciate it. And also, for those who want to call me a pussy or are just going to insult me, please don't, I'm having a hard enough time as it is, and please just constructive advice. Thank you.

TL;DR: My ex broke up with me because she needs to find herself. I still love her and want her back, but I also don't want to lose her as a friend. Can I still be friends with her while she's away? How do I get her back when she's ready?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, OP, it sounds like your ex is using this 'finding herself' excuse to get out of the relationship. If she's not willing to work on your relationship or communicate with you, then it's probably best to move on. You deserve someone who wants to be with you and work through issues together. Don't waste your time trying to get her back if she's not interested."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, it's great that you're willing to support your ex's personal growth, but you need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. If you're not ready to accept that she may not come back to you, then it's best to take a break from each other. You can't force someone to come back to you, and it's not healthy to hold onto hope that she'll change her mind. Take this time to focus on yourself and your own personal growth."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "OP, I think you're being really understanding and empathetic towards your ex's situation. If you're willing to wait for her to find herself, then that's a big step. However, you need to set boundaries and communicate your expectations clearly with her. Let her know that you're willing to wait, but you also need to maintain a connection with her as friends. Don't be afraid to express your feelings and needs to her, and make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of holding onto hope."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not buying the 'finding herself' excuse. If she's not willing to work on your relationship or communicate with you, then she's not interested in being with you. Don't waste your time trying to get her back if she's not willing to put in the effort. You deserve someone who wants to be with you and work through issues together."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "OP, it's great that you're willing to support your ex's personal growth, but you need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. If you're not ready to accept that she may not come back to you, then it's best to take a break from each other. You can't force someone to come back to you, and it's not healthy to hold onto hope that she'll change her mind. Take this time to focus on yourself and your own personal growth. Remember, you are worthy of love and happiness, regardless of whether your ex comes back to you or not."

TITLE: Friend wants me to pitch in money for gift

POST: I belong to a friend group and when one of our friends found out her mom's cancer was no longer being helped by chemo and her condition was terminal apparently someone decided we'd send an edible arrangement. Don't get me wrong I think it was a nice gesture but we're poor college students and it was going to involve each of us pitching in $12. In our group chat another girl and I said it was too much and maybe we could find something else. That was the last I heard of it until our friend who left sent a message thanking all of us for the EA. That was in February and I've forgotten about it until now; the girl "in charge" just texted and asked me to pay her the $12 for the EA. 

I don't want to be an ass but I didn't agree to paying for it and yet I'm still expected to. I sent our friend something little on my own thinking I wasn't included in the fruit. I know $12 doesn't seem like much but I'm pretty broke plus honestly I don't really think it's fair I have to pay. the girl who asked for the money and I aren't really close so I don't know how to handle this.

TL;DR: Friend wants me to pay $12 for an edible arrangement I didn't agree to, I'm broke and don't think it's fair.

TITLE: So my girlfriend (29F) broke up with me (29M) about 6 weeks ago. She keeps giving me mixed signals about getting back together, what should I do?

POST: So she decided we needed some time and space from me on the weekend I was planning to propose (she didn't know about my plans), we got to talking about our relationship and some issues that had been swept under the rug for a while finally came to light on both our ends. After 2 weeks of space and time I started reaching out to try and work things out, she said she needed more time I said we should work on things together, after a bit of a discussion she decided if I can't give her the time and space then it's over and broke up with me. It's been a total of 6 weeks including the time a day space. We've stayed in contact the whole time and some days she seems to be hinting at getting back together and other days she's very standoffish and says we'll never get back together, just give up hope. With all the back and forth, I heard she was dating someone now so I asked and she said she's not, she's just friends with a guy but they're talking a lot and getting to know each other but that's it. Then the next day she's telling me how much she loves me and got upset that I deleted our pics off social media (yet she had unfriended me weeks ago). She says she wants to keep a friendship with me but I told her I can't, not with how in love I still am and specially not if she's talking to someone else because I think it's BS she won't try to fix things with me, but is willing to give someone else her time and attention. I love her, more than I've ever loved any woman before, she's the first and only girl I've ever bought an engagement ring for. My family adores her, my kids have become attached to her and call her mommy, her son has done the same with me and calls me dad. I just don't know what to do now, I'm tired of feeling depressed and being on this emotional Rollercoaster of getting my hopes up one day, and shooting me down the next. What do you guys suggest I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend broke up with me 6 weeks ago, we've been in contact the whole time, she's giving me mixed signals about getting back together, she's talking to someone else, but says it's just friendship. I'm torn between giving up hope and trying to work things out. What should I do?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not ready to commit to you and is using you as a crutch while she figures out what she wants. You deserve better than to be strung along like this. Take care of yourself and focus on your own healing. You don't need to be in a relationship that's causing you so much emotional distress."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "It's great that you're still in love with her, but you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If she's not willing to commit to you and is still talking to someone else, it's likely she's not interested in rekindling things. You deserve someone who is all in and willing to work through issues together. Consider taking a break from her and focusing on yourself for a bit. You might find that you're happier and more fulfilled without the stress and uncertainty of this relationship."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're being too optimistic about the situation. If she's not willing to commit to you and is still talking to someone else, it's likely she's not interested in rekindling things. You deserve someone who is all in and willing to work through issues together. I would suggest taking a break from her and focusing on yourself for a bit.

TITLE: Me [18M/] got cheated on by my girlfriend of 2 years [18/F]. We broke up.

POST: I'm a mess. She cheated on me with someone she met in Spain at a festival. I absolutely adore this girl. I've known her for about 7/8 years, and there's always been something between us. We properly got together 2 years ago, and it was the happiest I've ever been.

She's my best friend, the person who I could tell everything to. I don't have anyone else to talk to and now I'm just falling apart. She told me yesterday and I didn't sleep at all last night. The pain is unlike anything I've ever felt, and the only person who I could possible talk about it with was her. I feel more lonely now then I can ever remember.

We were supposed to be going on holiday next week together, that's out the window now. It was with my family and I have to tell them today. My family adored her.

I'm just at a loss right now. I never would've suspected she would do something like this. I am so angry at her but at the same time I want to stay with her with all of my being. I don't have anyone else to talk to.

She's been my life for 2 years, and now in an instant she's gone. I just feel empty and this is the most emotional pain I've ever felt in my life. I don't know what to do, who to talk to or where to go. Please help.

TL;DR: I got cheated on by my 2-year girlfriend. I'm devastated and feeling lost. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Please help.

TITLE: What do you programmers / engineers think of your project managers?

POST: Hey all,

I wanted to start a legitimate conversation about how coders view project managers and why they have those views. I am coming to the end of my senior year and I begin grad school in August where my focus will be in project management within the information technology realm. 

I myself have some background in coding (Java, Javascript, C, C#, VB.NET, some HTML / ASP.NET, SQL / MySQL) but not enough interest, drive, or skill to go out and do what you all do. I feel I have always been more of a people driven worker, and my passion for technology has helped me to decide to stay involved with it; this is why I landed in the world of Project Management. However, it disturbs me to see how many members of project teams despise their managers. 

I am asking you all this because I am finally able to start putting work in to really accelerate my learning in this sector, and one of the things I strongly believe in is getting information from the source. So I'm ask you all now;

What do you think of your P.M.'s? Why do you think it? What would you suggest to make them better? 

I'm doing this so  when my time comes, I can be the best manager possible, so please no flaming.

TL;DR: I'm a soon-to-be project manager looking for feedback from programmers and engineers on their views of project managers. What do you think of your P.M.'s? Why do you think it? What would you suggest to make them better?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: As a programmer, I have to say that I've had some great PMs and some terrible ones. The good ones understand the technical aspects of the project and can communicate effectively with the team. They also know when to step in and when to let us do our thing. The bad ones are clueless about the tech and try to micromanage everything. My suggestion would be to hire PMs with a technical background or at least some experience working with developers.
2. **u/CodeMonkey3000**: I've had my fair share of PMs, and I have to say that most of them are clueless about the technical aspects of the project. They just care about meeting deadlines and budget constraints. They don't understand that we're trying to build something that works, not just something that looks good on paper. My suggestion would be to have PMs work closely with the development team to understand the technical aspects of the project.
3. **u/SoftwareEngineer42**: As a software engineer, I've had some great PMs who understood the technical aspects of the project and were able to communicate effectively with the team. They were able to prioritize tasks and make tough decisions when necessary. My suggestion would be to have PMs with a technical background or at least some experience working with developers. It's also important to have a clear understanding of the project goals and requirements.

5. **u/ProjectManager101**: As a project manager, I can attest that it's not easy to manage a team of developers. It requires a deep understanding of the technical aspects of the project and the ability to communicate effectively with the team. My suggestion would be to have PMs with a technical background or at least some experience working with developers. It's also important to have a clear understanding of the project goals and requirements.

**Common Themes:**

* Many programmers and engineers have had negative experiences with project managers who lack technical understanding or try to micromanage.
* A technical background or experience working with developers is important for project managers to be effective.
* Clear communication and understanding of project goals and requirements are crucial for successful project management.
* Some project managers are seen as clueless about the technical aspects of the project and only care about meeting deadlines and budget constraints.

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post highlight the importance of having project managers with a technical background or experience working with developers. Many programmers and engineers have had negative experiences with project managers who lack technical understanding or try to micromanage. Clear communication and understanding of project goals and requirements are crucial for successful project management. As a soon-to-be project manager, it's essential to understand these perspectives and strive to be a effective and technical-savvy project manager.

TITLE: Why did I not come here before?

POST: I was referred here during finals week last semester, but I never actually got around to looking at this sub until today. Seeing all of the posts, I can't help but feel awe and shame. Why do I take each day for granted and not strive for greatness like you do? I used to think myself a perfectionist because I force myself to be discouraged when I am not perfect, but that isn't the point of having the goal of perfection. The point is to keep moving, to welcome the defeat and criticism and just move forward and up. That's why I was reminded of [this,] and I just wanted to thank you all. My rugby club is in the playoffs now, and seeing all of these posts reminded me of what I need to be doing to improve myself and my skills.

TL;DR: I'm a perfectionist who's been struggling to find motivation. I stumbled upon this subreddit and realized I've been taking life for granted. I'm grateful for the inspiration and motivation I've found here and I'm determined to improve myself and my skills.

COMMENT 1: Welcome to the community! It's amazing how a little bit of motivation can go a long way. I'm glad you're feeling inspired to improve yourself and your skills. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. That's how we grow. Keep pushing yourself and don't be too hard on yourself when you don't meet your expectations. You got this!

COMMENT 2: I totally get where you're coming from. I used to be a perfectionist too, and it was suffocating me. But then I realized that perfection is the enemy of progress. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. And it's okay to not be perfect. In fact, it's okay to be imperfect. That's what makes us human. Keep pushing yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you don't meet your expectations. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

COMMENT 3: I'm glad you're feeling motivated! It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your goals and what you want to achieve. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to achieve everything at once. Break your goals down into smaller, manageable steps, and focus on making progress one step at a time. And don't forget to celebrate your successes along the way. You got this!

COMMENT 4: I love your attitude! It's great that you're recognizing the importance of self-improvement and taking steps to make it happen. Remember, it's a journey, not a destination. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep pushing yourself, and you'll be amazed at how far you can go. And don't forget to be kind to yourself along the way. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

TITLE: What the hell can I do?

POST: I teach art lessons to underprivileged youths at a nearby elementary school through an organization at my university. After only ever teaching in middle/upper class areas, working with these kids has been a very eye-opening experience. I'll cut to the chase though... Today was my last day working with this particular class of kids, and one table started talking about when they were afraid of their parents. Two girls admitted that their parents regularly belted them, with one also saying her dad whipped her with metal wire, too, and the other saying her dad pounded her hand with a brick. When I tried to tell them that it was wrong for their parents to hurt them and told them it's illegal, they disagreed and thought it wasn't illegal. Yet another started crying when she got a somewhat poor progress report she had to take home for her parents to sign, saying her dad was going to beat her like he usually did. A different girl also told me that her mom calls her a "fat bitch" and that her dad was deported and went to jail after trying to kill her mother.

I asked the graduate student who serves as supervisor of the other undergraduate mentors like me what, if anything, I should do. Her exact words were, "If you didn't see bruises, you can't say shit." In a sad way I agree, and I realize I also have no proof that these kids are telling the truth, although they seemed serious. But thinking about some man taking a brick to a 9 year-old girl just makes me sick.
So I thought I'd ask you, Reddit. What can or should I do? I need some peace of mind.

Some background notes: I am a 20 year-old white female in California. My kids are 5th graders, primarily Hispanic, and low income. I am not an official teacher or counselor-- just a college volunteer mentor.

TL;DR: I'm a college student volunteering at an elementary school, and I just found out that some of my students are being physically and emotionally abused by their parents. I'm unsure what to do or if I should do anything at all.

**Comments:**

* "You're not an official teacher or counselor, but you're still a human being with a conscience. If you're not comfortable reporting this to the authorities, you could at least talk to the graduate student supervisor again and express your concerns. Maybe she'll have some advice or resources to share."
* "I'm not a lawyer, but I think it's illegal to hit a child with a brick or metal wire. You don't need proof to report suspected child abuse. You can call the child abuse hotline or talk to a school administrator. Don't let fear of not having proof hold you back from doing something."

TITLE: I've lied to all of my friends and built a false image of myself for anyone I have ever met.

POST: I don't know when it started. I don't know why it started. Most people put on masks or armor when dealing with others. I have so many mask and so many sets of armor. I can't pretend to be a real person anymore. I can't pretend that people know and understand me anymore.

Let me try and give you some background.

I am an 18 year old senior that had a chance to go to MIT full ride. I'm reasonable intelligent, 5;10, lithe wiry musculature, 140 lbs. I play sports, I did martial arts, I took advanced placement classes and I was friends with everyone. I did not date because I kept telling myself there was no one I really liked. That is what helped bring this all to a head.

It's not that there wasn't a girl that I liked enough to date, it's that there wasn't a single person around me who I could open up to. Who I could explain that I was a fake. That I lied about my childhood to everyone. That I lied about my adolescence to everyone. I've had plenty of friends, if you can call them that. I've had flings with women, if you can call them flings. I've been the life of the party and the main actor in a spotlight.

I've never been me.

Moving on now to the internet, I've been browsing for about eight years now. I was the generic kiddo on the internet for the first four. I quickly grew tired and developed yet another false identity.

I was a 16 year old Asian girl that went to my school for years. Some of my friends still don't know mostly because we haven't talked in a while. I took on a maternal role for a forum, quickly becoming a therapist in a sense. People would come to me and ask me for life advice and other nonsense and I would lie to them about who and what I was and give them their idiotic advice. Some would come back with success stories. Others would come back for more advice.

I'm really just rambling now and have no clue where i wanted to take this.

TL;DR: I've been lying to everyone I've ever met, including myself. I've built a false image of myself and I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to be real.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. We all put on a mask sometimes. It's okay to not be 100% authentic all the time. Maybe try being a little more genuine with the people you care about and see how that goes?"
* "I think you're being too harsh on yourself. It's okay to have a persona or a character. It's how we present ourselves to the world. Maybe try to find people who accept you for who you are, even if that's not the'real' you."
* "I think you're struggling with some deep-seated issues. Have you considered seeking help from a therapist or counselor? They can help you work through these feelings and find a way to be more authentic."
* "I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Are you saying you're a fake person or that you're pretending to be someone you're not? Either way, it sounds like you're really struggling. Maybe try to take things one step at a time and focus on being honest with yourself and others."
* "I think you're being a bit too dramatic. It's okay to have a little bit of flair or personality. Maybe try to find a balance between being yourself and being a little more outgoing. You don't have to be 100% authentic all the time."

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "I appreciate all of your comments, but I think you're all missing the point. I'm not just talking about being a little more genuine or having a persona. I'm talking about being a completely different person. I've lied about my entire life, my entire identity. I've built a false image of myself and I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to be real. I don't know how to be myself."
* "I know it sounds dramatic, but it's the truth. I've been living a lie for so long, I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what I want or what I like or what I'm passionate about. I've been so focused on being someone else, I've forgotten how to be myself."
* "I know it's not easy to understand, but I'm trying to be honest with you all. I'm trying to be honest with myself. I just wish someone could understand me, could see me for who I really am, and not judge me for it."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my parents [50s M/F]. Father is emotionally abusive to my mother-questions

POST: Sorry for wall of text.

This is an issue that has been ongoing for most of my life. My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother. Luckily it has never turned physical (AFAIK), but whenever I visit home, I hear my father scream at and berate my mother for every little thing. For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).

I'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him. Whenever I bring up this issue, she always tells me that he is working on his temper and has other good qualities. However, my mother consistently tells me that he wasn't like this when she married him and if she had known how he would turn out, she wouldn't have.

I've already told her that when I have children I will be extremely hesitant to leave them alone with my parents. Their relationship has affected my own views on relationships greatly. Beyond that, I'm not sure what I can do. Cut off all contact until she leaves him? Just continue to ignore it for the rest of my life? I have no idea what the protocol is for situations like this.

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being a passive bystander.

Summary of what he does: demeans her opinions and beliefs, always believes he is right, yells constantly, doesn't care about feelings, constantly makes threats.

TL;DR: Father is emotionally abusive to my mother, I'm tired of seeing it, don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for your father to treat your mother like this. Have you considered talking to your mother about how it's affecting you? It might be helpful for her to see the impact it's having on you and your siblings. - u/ConcernedCitizen
* OP, I think it's great that you're aware of the emotional abuse and are concerned about your mother's well-being. However, it's important to remember that your mother is an adult and can make her own decisions. While it's understandable that you want to protect her, it's not your responsibility to fix the situation. You can support her and be a good listener, but ultimately, it's up to her to decide what she wants to do. - u/RelationshipCoach

TITLE: TIFU by falling in love with a lesbian

POST: This happened last summer at UConn. I live in Connecticut.

My bestfriend has a girlfriend, who has an apartment at UConn. I like to drink and got really drunk walking around after we tried to sneak into a bar without paying the upfront tab.

We tried to get in through the kitchen. It smelt like buffalo wings, I led the way.

Non-sequitur. 

We got kicked out almost immediately. Being my drunk self, I lost my friends and made new friends, which I believe were frat boys. 

Drunk dancing like the left shark in the Super Bowl and started talking to hot black girls. They say they have a lesbian friend. Drunk JJ only hears Barney Stinson(I love HIMYM) say "Make a lesbian straight. Legen-dary." 

Meet lesbian friend, hook up and dance, fall in drunken love with a girl who is cool. For the first time in my life, my hook up meant something. We talked and I actually liked this girl. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later to a random dorm. She's hooking up with another random dude. And another dude. 

She hooked up with 3 other dudes after me. I don't think she was a lesbian. 

Drunk JJ doesn't care. She jumps on my lap and starts kissing me again after these other dudes. I liked it till I get that I'm being played.

My heart was broken until I realized there's a lot of lesbians I can turn straight. 

After leaving this random dorm, I got attacked by a deer. A deer in the middle of UConn's campus jumped me. I ran away and lived to tell this story to reddit.

I was so lost and drunk my best friends girlfriend had to find me. In the meantime, I ran into a skunk who ran away from me. I believe it was because of the fake lesbian smell.

TL;DR: I fell in love with a girl who claimed to be a lesbian, but ended up hooking up with multiple guys after me. I got attacked by a deer and almost got sprayed by a skunk. I learned that there are a lot of lesbians I can turn straight.

EDIT: I know this is a stupid story, but I'm just glad I didn't get hurt too badly. I also learned that I should not drink too much. I'm just glad I have a good sense of humor about it. I hope you guys enjoy this story. I'm just glad I can share it with you. I hope you guys can learn from my mistakes. I hope you guys can enjoy this story. I hope you guys can laugh at my expense.

TITLE: Me [17 M] with a girl [16 F] who I don't know how to let down.

POST: There is a backstory behind this so let me give it to everyone straight. I'm 17 M never dated anyone before. I have made posts prior to this one based around my issues with being able to date.

My biggest issue is that once a girl peeks my interest I pursue her until she develops the same feelings. Once I understand she is interested too I sort of back off. A friend of mine called me a "chaser" which is what I feel I am.

Now I have this girl that I know, really sweet, really smart, talented, the whole thing. I found recently she has feelings for me and we talked a bit about it after I mentioned I was aware of them. 

When we talked I gave her the impression that I wanted to date her and that we should talk in person and hang out a big more to be dating. The only issue is my gut AGAIN like always is telling me I'm not interested even though I really want to be, I'm just not.

TL;DR: I have a girl who has feelings for me, I want to be honest with her but I don't know how to let her down without hurting her.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being really honest with yourself about your feelings. It's okay to not be interested in someone, even if they have feelings for you. You can still be kind and respectful towards her while being honest. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about your feelings and be clear about why you don't feel the same way. It's better to be honest now than to lead her on and potentially hurt her more in the long run."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to not be interested in someone, and it's not your fault that you're not feeling the same way. You can still be kind and respectful towards her, and you don't have to lead her on or pretend to feel something you don't. Just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. It's better to be honest now than to keep pretending and potentially hurt her more in the long run."
3. **u/awkward_situation**: "OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before and it's always hard to know how to let someone down gently. But honestly, the best thing you can do is just be honest with her. Tell her how you feel and why you don't feel the same way. It's better to be honest now than to keep pretending and potentially hurt her more in the long run. And who knows, she might even appreciate your honesty and be able to move on."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I agree with the other commenters. You're 17 and you've never dated anyone before. Maybe you're just not ready for a relationship yet? Maybe you need to focus on yourself and figure out what you want before you start dating someone else. Just a thought."
5. **u/relationship_expert**: "OP, I think you're being too focused on the 'how' and not enough on the 'why'. Why do you feel like you need to let her down gently? Is it because you're worried about hurting her feelings? Or is it because you're worried about what others will think? Whatever the reason, I think you need to take a step back and think about what's truly important here. Is it being honest with her, or is it being kind to her? You can't always be kind and honest at the same time, and sometimes you have to choose one over the other."

---

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your comments! I really appreciate your honesty and advice. I think I was worried about hurting her feelings and also what others would think, but you're right, being honest is the best way to go. I'm going to take your advice and have a conversation with her about my feelings. I'm a little nervous, but I know it's the right thing to do. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: Petty pool day destruction

POST: So yesterday my girlfriend and I were at a public pool trying to relax a little bit and maybe catch up on some reading. Unfortunately it started raining so we took shelter under a little poolside gondola that fitted two people. The two of us were sitting and talking and having a nice time when a tennis ball bounced over to us. I noticed a group of about five boys around the age of 12 looking at me so I assumed they had accidentally overthrown it and rolled the ball back to them. 

Two minutes passed and another ball flies up to me. Again I rolled it back. After the third ball I knew something was up and I started to watch as the boys would wait until we weren't looking and throw a ball at us and then run up and retrieve it. After multiple throws, one of the balls flew up and smacked my girlfriend right in the chest. I threw all of the tennis balls I collected over the fence and glared at the laughing kids. 

The lifeguard walked up to us with a smile and told us to let her know if they threw another ball because she would love to kick them out. She also mentioned that she had berated the kids. 

Two of the kids came up and gave us a meek apology but my petty revenge was already plotted. The kids had not thrown a ball after the lifeguard's talk but on our way out we stopped by her stand and told her how they threw more balls at us. My girlfriend and I watched triumphantly as their pool day came to a sudden close.

TL;DR: Kids threw tennis balls at us at a public pool, we got revenge by telling the lifeguard and watching them get kicked out.

COMMENT 1: Ahahahaha, that's some top-notch petty revenge right there! I love how you and your girlfriend worked together to take down those little troublemakers. The image of the lifeguard giving them a stern talking-to is just priceless. 

COMMENT 2: I'm dying over here! The fact that you collected all the tennis balls and then threw them over the fence is just genius. I would've done the same thing. Those kids deserved it after throwing balls at you and your girlfriend. 

COMMENT 3: I'm a little surprised the lifeguard didn't just kick them out on the spot. I mean, throwing balls at people is just not okay. But I guess it's good that she gave them a warning first. Still, I hope those kids learned their lesson and won't be doing that again anytime soon. 

COMMENT 4: I love how you and your girlfriend didn't let the kids get away with their behavior. You stood up for yourselves and got revenge in a clever way. I hope you guys had a great rest of your day after that. 

COMMENT 5: I'm a little disappointed that you didn't get to see the kids get kicked out. I would've loved to see the look on their faces when they realized they were getting in trouble. But I guess it's good that you and your girlfriend got to enjoy the rest of your day without any more drama. 

COMMENT 6: I think it's great that you and your girlfriend worked together to take down those kids. It's always more fun to have a partner in crime, or in this case, in petty revenge. I hope you guys have many more adventures together. 

COMMENT 7: I'm a little surprised that the kids didn't get in trouble for throwing balls at people. I mean, it's not like they were just playing a game, they were intentionally trying to hurt someone. I hope the lifeguard took their parents' contact information and gave them a good scolding.

TITLE: Not sure if this is the right place. My [30m] SO [28f] doesn't think she's pretty.

POST: I recently saw a commercial on TV for Dove soap. In the commercial a statistic came on the screen that stated, "9 out of 10 women do not think they are beautiful"

My gf [28f] falls into the 9 out of 10 women who think that. 

She is blonde, blue eyes and petite. Has amazing curves in all the right places. Big breasts and a great ass. She exercises three times a week. Loves to dirt bike and shoot guns!  (I think her personality is just as beautiful as her body)

When we walk down the street,  almost every guy we walk past checks her out. She doesn't notice this. My guy friends have all let me know I'm pretty lucky to have found a girl as good looking as her. Her female friends are jealous of her body. Her bi friend has even expressed interest in having sex with her!

What I'm getting at here is that she is clearly beautiful to everyone but herself. :(

She recently has expressed the desire to get botox done on her forehead and between her eyebrows. Preventive measure she'll tell me. 

I don't disagree or think it a bad idea. I just feel like she's doing it for the wrong reason. That reason being that she feels like she's not pretty. 

She had a breast reduction in the last year. And recently started getting her eyelashes extended. I think this is relevant. 

What can I do? I tell her all the time she's beautiful. I'll send random texts, leave notes in her lunch, flowers. Everything I can to get her to accept she's pretty. 

I want her to feel pretty before she needs to change her entire body.

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't think she's pretty, despite being physically attractive. She's considering botox and other procedures. I want to help her see her own beauty before she changes her body.

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: the struggle to help a partner overcome negative self-perception and body image issues. The OP (original poster) is concerned about his girlfriend's desire to undergo cosmetic procedures and wants to help her see her own beauty before she makes any changes.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the situation. The OP also shows empathy and understanding towards his girlfriend's feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, the post also raises some questions about the OP's motivations and whether he is truly trying to help his girlfriend or if he is trying to control her appearance.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* Encouraging the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about her feelings and concerns.
* Suggesting that the OP focus on building his girlfriend's self-esteem and confidence rather than trying to change her appearance.
* Offering advice on how to support his girlfriend in her desire to undergo cosmetic procedures, while also encouraging her to consider alternative solutions that may be more effective in addressing her concerns.

Overall, this post is a great example of the types of relationship-related issues that are discussed in the r/relationships subreddit, and it provides a good opportunity for users to offer advice and support to the OP and his girlfriend.

SUBREDDIT: r/Advice

TITLE: Should I be concerned about my friend's one time use of MDMA?

POST: So I've always had the "traditional" view on drugs I.e. all drugs are bad etc. When I met my friend, who smokes weed, I've attempted to open my mind somewhat about drugs. I don't have a problem with her smoking weed in fact I've tried it with her a few times.  
However, last night she told me that a few weeks ago she and a couple of friends did MDMA. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Because of my upbringing, I always thought MDMA will fuck you over big style, but after I did some research I felt a little better. I'm still uneasy though. She did say "I probably wouldn't want to do it again, it was fun and all but ehh"  
Am I right to be concerned that she's going to have no qualms about trying even harder stuff I.e heroin, crack, meth?  
There's a certain uneasiness I feel in addition, which I can't quite pin down, I think it stems to the fact that my wonderful, awesome friend is trying things I'd never considered her doing, and that opens a new side to her I've never seen before. But thats my problem, not hers.

TL;DR: Friend did MDMA once, I'm concerned she'll start doing harder drugs. Should I be worried?

---

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **[username]**: "You're not wrong to be concerned, but it's also important to remember that one-time use of MDMA doesn't necessarily mean she's going to start doing harder drugs. It's also important to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Ask her why she did it, how she felt, and what she thought about it. This can help you understand her perspective and potentially address any underlying issues that may be driving her to experiment with drugs."
2. **[username]**: "I think you're overestimating the likelihood of her moving on to harder drugs. MDMA is a relatively mild drug compared to others, and it's not uncommon for people to try it once and not feel the need to do it again. It's also important to remember that people make their own choices, and it's not your place to dictate what she can or can't do. Instead, focus on being a supportive and understanding friend, and let her know that you're there for her if she needs to talk about anything."
3. **[username]**: "I think you're being a bit too judgmental. Your friend is an adult, and she's made her own decision about trying MDMA. It's not your place to dictate what she can or can't do, and it's not your responsibility to worry about her drug use. Instead, focus on being a supportive and understanding friend, and let her know that you're there for her if she needs to talk about anything. And who knows, maybe she'll learn something from the experience and become a more well-rounded person because of it."
4. **[username]**: "I think you're being a bit too paranoid. Just because your friend did MDMA once doesn't mean she's going to start doing harder drugs. It's also important to remember that people make their own choices, and it's not your place to dictate what she can or can't do. Instead, focus on being a supportive and understanding friend, and let her know that you're there for her if she needs to talk about anything. And who knows, maybe she'll learn something from the experience and become a more well-rounded person because of it."
5. **[username]**: "I think you're being a bit too judgmental. Your friend is an adult, and she's made her own decision about trying MDMA. It's not your place to dictate what she can or can't do, and it's not your responsibility to worry about her drug use. Instead, focus on being a supportive and understanding friend, and let her know that you're there for her if she needs to talk about anything. And who knows, maybe she'll learn something from the experience and become a more well-rounded person because of it."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The subreddit's overall sentiment is that the OP should not be overly concerned about their friend's one-time use of MDMA. Many users suggest that it's important to have an open and honest conversation with their friend about their concerns, but also to remember that people make their own choices and it's not the OP's place to dictate what their friend can or can't do. Some users also suggest that the OP should focus on being a supportive and understanding friend, rather than being judgmental or paranoid. Overall, the subreddit's sentiment is one of caution and understanding, rather than alarm or judgment.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my gf [19 F] of 6 months, communicate too much?

POST: we've been speaking to eachother practically every day, atleast every few hours for the last 6 months and this morning she just started ignoring me? i see her active on social media yet she doesnt respond to anything i say, which is weird. but im starting to realize just how much we communicate so maybe this is healthy? 

i dont think ive ever really been in a "healthy" relationship before, my last gf of a year cheated on me the one and only night we decided to go off to separate parties in a year long relationship, and we communicated daily. so should i say something, or... am i being too clingy?

TL;DR: 6 month old relationship, communicate daily, girlfriend starts ignoring me, unsure if its healthy or if im being too clingy

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, 6 months is still pretty early in a relationship. It's normal for things to slow down a bit. Maybe she's just busy or stressed out. Try not to overthink it and give her some space. If you're really concerned, you could try sending her a casual 'hey, everything okay?' message and see how she responds."
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: "I think you're being a bit too clingy, OP. It's great that you're invested in the relationship, but you need to learn to respect her boundaries. If she's not responding, maybe she needs some space. Try not to take it personally and focus on your own life for a bit. You can always reach out to her later and see how she's doing."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I'm not sure if it's healthy to communicate daily. That's a lot of pressure and can be overwhelming. Maybe try to scale back a bit and see how that goes. You can still show your interest and care for each other without being glued to each other's phones 24/7."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "OP, I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's not ignoring you on purpose, but maybe she's just feeling overwhelmed or needs some space. Try to approach the conversation calmly and without accusations. Good luck!"
5. **RelationshipRookie**: "I'm new to all this, but I think it's normal to feel a bit anxious when your partner starts ignoring you. Maybe try to focus on other things and take your mind off it? You can always try reaching out to her later and see how she's doing. Good luck, OP!"


**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I might have been being a bit too clingy, and I'll try to give her some space. I'll also try to scale back on the daily communication and see how that goes. And yeah, I'll definitely have a conversation with her about how I'm feeling. Thanks again for the help!"


**Conclusion:**

The original poster is seeking advice on whether his daily communication with his girlfriend is healthy or if he's being too clingy. The commenters offer a range of perspectives, from suggesting that he give her space and respect her boundaries to encouraging him to have an open conversation with her about his feelings. The original poster takes the advice to heart and decides to scale back on the daily communication and have a conversation with his girlfriend. The post serves as a reminder that relationships require communication, understanding, and compromise, and that it's okay to take things at a slower pace.

TITLE: TIFU by getting high and petting my dog

POST: Me and my brother got high this morning and decided to plug in the ole gamecube to the tv, so we go to our garage to find it. We find it and we decide to take it upstairs. 

(We have some stairs that lead from the house into the garage, and we did not realize our dog followed us down the stairs to the garage.)

Anyways I tell my brother I will carry her up the stairs and he can keep taking the gamecube to the room.

(I got a big golden retriever dog thats pretty old so she doesn't like to climb up stairs, shes around 80 pounds or something like that)

Anyways as I go to pick her up, and me being high as fuck still thought she was very soft. (I was also shirtless so it felt really good)

So I start rubbing against her and hugging her and all of a sudden my garage door opens up and three construction workers were staring at me, shirtless, in the middle of a garage, rubbing against my dog.

(apparently there was some work being done today I forgot about)

They just started in awe for a little bit then one of them was like "well give you a few more mins" and they walked away for a bit, two of them looking confused as fuck and one of them chuckling...

TL;DR: Got high, petted my dog in the garage, construction workers walked in on me shirtless, rubbing against my dog.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't get high and pet your dog in the garage, especially if there's construction work being done.

---

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/tifu, which stands for "Today I F**ked Up." The post is a humorous account of a situation where the author got high and made a silly mistake, which led to an embarrassing encounter with construction workers. The post is relatable and entertaining, and the author's honesty and self-deprecation make it a great read. The moral of the story is a classic "don't do this" warning, but it's delivered in a lighthearted and humorous way. Overall, this post is a great example of the type of content that is often found on r/tifu.

TITLE: Hotel room next door won't turn down their TV...

POST: I moved into a super crappy extended stay hotel for a week because my apartment lease ran up on friday and I can't move into my new place until Wednesday. Horrible management, ghetto furniture, weird smell, half working heater, but whatever I'm a single guy right? Suck it up, save a few bucks by staying in a cheapo place.
We'll along with all that are paper thin walls and a horrible neighbor that moved in yesterday. They have a dog that barked all day yestersay and when they finally got home they turned their TV volume way up. I went and knocked on their door twice asking to turn it down with no result. Didn't get to sleep until 1 when they finally turned it off.

Cut to today, I've had 3 more hours of dog barking until they got home and then dancing with the stars cranked way up followed by what I think is Nancy Grace coverage of Furgeson and they won't even answer the door this time. I'm done at this point so I hooked up my laptop, maxed the TV and hit play on a 30 minute Nyan Cat loop. I'm ready to fight dirty. Up next is heavy metal from my high school days. 

Muted the TV at the end of typing this, I've won! They turned it down!

TL;DR: Neighbor won't turn down their TV, I retaliate with Nyan Cat and heavy metal, they finally turn it down.

EDIT: I should add that I'm not proud of what I did, but I was at my wit's end and I just wanted some peace and quiet. I'm not going to do it again, but I'm glad it worked.

---

This post is a great example of petty revenge, as the author is seeking revenge against their neighbor for not turning down their TV volume. The author is frustrated and fed up with the noise and lack of consideration from their neighbor, and they decide to take matters into their own hands by playing loud music to drown out the neighbor's TV. The post is humorous and relatable, and it highlights the importance of being considerate of others and respecting their boundaries.

The post also raises questions about the limits of petty revenge and whether it is ever justified. In this case, the author is not seeking to cause harm or damage to their neighbor, but rather to assert their own needs and boundaries. However, the post also highlights the potential consequences of engaging in petty revenge, as it can lead to escalation and further conflict.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities of human behavior and the ways in which we respond to frustration and annoyance. It is a relatable and humorous post that highlights the importance of being considerate of others and respecting their boundaries.

TITLE: Studying in Madrid this July, have a free week after. What should I do?

POST: Basically, as the title says, I'll be studying in Madrid this coming July through a program with my (American) university. 

I have a free week after and am trying to figure out how I would best spend it. I realize it's not a lot of time, but I'd like to hear what you would do if you had an extra week.

I'll probably have seen enough of Spain (and a little bit of Portugal, probably) to be happy, so I'm thinking of traveling elsewhere in Europe. However, I'm a Brazilian citizen, which probably doesn't affect much, but it's worth considering if I have to cross borders. 

I don't expect to go backpacking/hiking/scuba-diving or anything like that in such a short amount of time, but I'd be very happy being a "fish out of water." I love beaches and mountains, really any scenery or cities would be cool with me. 

Basically, this would just be a good way for me to whet my appetite with a little bit of Europe. Probably I have enough time to explore maybe two cities or so counting travel, maybe see a good museum or two and eat some interesting food. 

If you have suggestions (anybody know anything about getting into the Paris tunnels?) about any thing that I just **need** to see/visit/eat/dance or something, I'd love to hear it. Also, my birthday falls during this free week, and I don't know if I'll have any companions with me as of yet, but anything I could do to celebrate my birthday would be cool as well.

TL;DR: Free week in Europe after studying in Madrid, looking for suggestions on what to do, where to go, and how to spend my birthday.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/EuropeanAdventurer**: "Hey! Since you're a Brazilian citizen, you won't need a visa for most European countries. I'd recommend exploring the French Riviera, it's stunning! You could visit Nice, Cannes, and Monaco. If you're interested in history and architecture, Paris is a must-see. You could also visit the Swiss Alps, they're breathtaking. For your birthday, consider taking a sunset dinner cruise in Nice or a wine tasting tour in the French countryside."
2. **u/TravelingTina**: "I think you should consider visiting the Italian lakes! Lake Como and Lake Maggiore are stunning, and you could take a boat ride or hike around them. If you're interested in art and architecture, Milan is a great city to visit. For your birthday, you could take a cooking class and learn how to make some traditional Italian dishes."
3. **u/EuroTrip**: "Hey! If you're looking for something off the beaten path, consider visiting the Czech Republic! Prague is an amazing city, and you could visit the Charles Bridge, St. Vitus Cathedral, and the Prague Castle. If you're interested in beer, you could visit the Pilsner Urquell brewery. For your birthday, you could take a brewery tour and sample some of the best beers in the world."
4. **u/TravelingTom**: "I think you should consider visiting the Netherlands! Amsterdam is a great city, and you could visit the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, and the Anne Frank House. If you're interested in nature, you could visit the Keukenhof Gardens, which are famous for their tulips. For your birthday, you could take a canal boat tour and see the city from a different perspective."
5. **u/ParisianPierre**: "Ah, Paris! It's a must-see city, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a Parisian. You could visit the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral. If you're interested in fashion, you could visit the Galeries Lafayette or the Champs-Élysées. For your birthday, you could take a Seine River cruise and see the city's landmarks from a different perspective."

**Other Comments:**

* **u/TravelingTina**: "Don't forget to try some of the local cuisine! You could try some traditional Spanish tapas in Madrid, and then try some Italian pasta in Italy."
* **u/EuroTrip**: "If you're interested in history, you could visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland. It's a somber but important place to visit."
* **u/TravelingTom**: "If you're looking for a beach vacation, you could visit the Greek islands! Mykonos and Santorini are both beautiful destinations."
* **u/ParisianPierre**: "If you're interested in art, you could visit the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. It's home to an impressive collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art."

I met Nick* on Tinder. I was just checking it out for fun, my best friend loved and used it etc. I met up with him and we just hung out. He's a nice guy and I just had broken up with my ex. So we became friends with benefits.

Since I left that summer for college, we just sext a lot. And often it was just texting but sometimes he would ask me for some pictures and I was naive  so I thought a 3 second picture on snapchat should get the job done and keep me safe.

Three months into this; snapchat notified me with the little triangle symbol that he had screenshoted it. And I **FLIPPED OUT**. I told him it made me uncomfortable and so the next time we met up, I had him deleted them off his computer. And I thought he understood that I didn't like the fact that he saved the pictures. He said he would stop. 

Recently, we met up and I asked him if he saved any of the pictures. And he said that he didn't. However, I saw on his phone that he had one of the apps that allows you to secretly screenshot snaps without letting the other person know.  

When he returned, I asked again. And he said maybe he saved a few and that he only did it because he really liked them and he saved them for fun. I begged him to delete the pictures and he said no. So I left. And he deleted me off snapchat. 

This guy that I trusted, has nudes of me. I am terrified and I understand I should never ever taken them in the first place. But I never thought he would be this kind of person. He was so sweet in the beginning. I fear he'll share them and ruin my career. I had a nightmare last night that he had cameras in his bedroom and that he has videos too. I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR: My FWB took screenshots of my nudes without my consent and won't delete them. I'm terrified he'll share them and ruin my career. What do I do?

*Note: I've kept his name anonymous for my own safety.

**Edit:** I've been getting a lot of comments and I just wanted to add that I'm not looking for pity or sympathy. I'm just looking for advice on what to do next. I know I should have been more careful, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. I appreciate all the comments and I'll try to respond to as many as I can.**END OF POST**

This post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users offering advice, support, and resources for the OP. Some common themes include:

* Reporting the incident to the authorities, such as the police or a college administrator
* Documenting evidence of the screenshots and any other relevant information
* Considering a restraining order or other legal action to protect the OP's privacy and safety
* Seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to cope with the emotional impact of the situation
* Avoiding further contact with the perpetrator and blocking his number and social media accounts
* Considering a change of phone number and/or email address to protect the OP's privacy
* Reminding the OP that they are not to blame for the situation and that they did nothing wrong

The post has also sparked a larger conversation about the importance of consent in relationships, the dangers of sexting, and the need for greater awareness and education about online privacy and safety.**END OF ANALYSIS**.

TITLE: Guilt about loans: holding me back, or keeping me from being a moron (again)?

POST: I graduated college with no debt 5 years ago (majored in English Literature, mistake number one), then threw that all in the garbage by taking out a large student loan to start a graduate program I subsequently quit.

I have been working whatever part-time jobs come my way since then. I promised myself that if I ever go back to school, I would save up my money first and pay my own way because I felt so stupid about being in debt with this loan for no reason.

But I have recently decided what I want to do with my life. I want to go back to school to get started on this path, but my current job pays less than 10 dollars an hour and I can't imagine how long it would take to save up enough money to really get started.

Should I go ahead and take out loans to finance my education now that I know what I want to do? Or is my guilt and hesitancy about debt rational? I know I'm miserable right now, but nothing is guaranteed and I feel like I may just be setting myself up for more misery and even deeper debt down the road if I still can't find a decent job later on (I want to go back to school to become a teacher and I know sometimes it's difficult for new teachers to find work). I really can't see finding a stable decent job with the degree I already have. I'd appreciate any advice.

TL;DR: I have a large student loan from quitting a graduate program, and I'm considering going back to school to become a teacher. I'm torn between taking out more loans to finance my education or waiting and saving up first. I'm worried about debt and not wanting to make the same mistake again.

RESPONSES:

* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not a moron for taking out loans, and you're not a moron for wanting to go back to school. You're just making a decision that's best for you. If you're willing to put in the work and make smart financial decisions, you can manage your debt and come out on top. Don't let guilt hold you back from pursuing your dreams."
* "I understand your concerns, but it sounds like you're already making a plan to manage your debt and make smart financial decisions. You're not just going to take out loans and not think about the consequences. You're thinking about your future and what you want to achieve. That's responsible. Don't let fear of debt hold you back from pursuing your goals."
* "I think you should take out loans, but not just because you want to go back to school. You should take out loans because you're making a smart financial decision. You're investing in yourself and your future. And if you're willing to put in the work and make smart financial decisions, you can pay off those loans and come out on top. Don't let guilt hold you back from making a decision that's best for you."
* "I think you should wait and save up first. You're already in debt, and taking out more loans could put you in a difficult financial situation. You should focus on paying off your current debt and building up your savings before taking on more debt. It's better to be safe than sorry, and you don't want to put yourself in a situation where you're struggling to make ends meet."
* "I think you should consider alternative options, like online courses or certification programs. These can be more affordable and flexible than traditional degree programs. You could also look into scholarships or grants to help fund your education. Don't feel like you have to take out loans just because you want to go back to school. There are other options available to you."

TITLE: Me (25F) and my guy (25M) of 6 years are in a bit of a huge argument due to another girl who has caused problems before.

POST: Let's see my ex SO of 5 years and I have been trying to work things out, but there are some factors that pretty much scream RUN. It starts off during the middle of our relationship when he talked to this girl during us dating, it caused us to break up because I would constantly bitch to him about how its fucked up he is talking to another girl so much. It turn out that I was right in the end about them "talking". Well we got back together not too long after I found out, because he was begging and promising that he did not know what he was doing and that he would drop it and I was in a tough place because I lost someone(death). Well years have passed, and we had broken up again. This time he told me that he had liked her, months later we started to try and rekindle things and then I saw him talking to her again, but he claimed he was fighting with her because she was talking to a kid he did not like. I asked him why he cared so much, and he said it was because she was his friend and he despises the kid. Which I know it total bullshit, but yet we were still trying to work on things. After months have passed, we still are trying until he started hanging out at her house, and she has been attending parties at his with her boyfriend and all because they all have mutual friends. He will talk to her, and continue to hang with her and friends. This is all no problem since we are technically not together. The issue is he does not understand why I would not be with him if he was friends with her, and he thinks it would be okay to be friends with this girl if we did get back together. Can someone give me their opinion as to what you think about all that?

TL;DR: Guy I've been with for 6 years has been friends with a girl who caused problems in our relationship before. He doesn't understand why I'm upset about it and thinks it's okay to be friends with her if we get back together.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm gonna give you my two cents. It sounds like your guy is not taking your feelings and boundaries seriously. He's not respecting the fact that you've been hurt by his actions in the past and is still choosing to prioritize his friendship with this girl over your relationship with him. It's not about being "friends" with her, it's about the fact that he's still involved with her in some way and that's causing you pain. You deserve better than someone who doesn't understand why you're upset and is willing to compromise your feelings for the sake of his friendship. It's time to take a hard look at whether this relationship is truly healthy for you.

COMMENT 2:
I agree with the previous commenter. It sounds like your guy is not taking your feelings seriously and is prioritizing his own desires over your needs. It's not okay for him to be friends with this girl, especially if it's causing you pain and discomfort. You deserve someone who respects your boundaries and prioritizes your feelings. It's time to reevaluate whether this relationship is truly healthy for you.

COMMENT 3:
I think it's important to consider the fact that your guy has a history of not being honest with you. He lied about talking to this girl initially, and now he's downplaying the significance of his friendship with her. It's hard to trust someone who has shown a pattern of dishonesty. You deserve someone who is transparent and honest with you, and it's hard to see how this relationship can move forward without that.

COMMENT 4:
I think it's time for you to take a step back and assess whether this relationship is truly worth the stress and pain it's causing you. It's not okay for your guy to be friends with this girl, and it's not okay for him to not take your feelings seriously. You deserve someone who respects and prioritizes your feelings, and it's time to consider whether this relationship is truly healthy for you.

COMMENT 5:
I think it's important to consider the fact that your guy is not taking responsibility for his actions. He's blaming you for being "jealous" and not understanding why he's friends with this girl. It's not about being jealous, it's about feeling hurt and betrayed by his actions. You deserve someone who takes responsibility for their actions and acknowledges the pain they've caused. It's time to reevaluate whether this relationship is truly healthy for you.

TITLE: Me [24F] with my bf [24M] of 2 years are having issues because of my personal problems

POST: I have a history of ending relationships out of nowhere. I'm not entirely sure why besides that I just get scared of the commitment that comes with long term relationships.

As of recently, I have just been feeling really not myself. I have good days and I have bad days where I feel really low. On the good days I'm convinced that I'm just being weird and that it will pass. On bad days I feel really negative and agitated.

As of recently the low days are outnumbering the good days. I feel very irritable and I feel so bad for how my bf has to deal with it. I sometimes don't feel like being touched. He is so loving and just wants to be near me and snuggle all the time but it just makes me push him away and get agitated. The more I push the more he tries to fix it and by being more loving.

I have zero sex drive and I end up declining his advances because I never feel up to it. We talked last night and he said he feels like I don't care about him as much anymore. That broke my heart because i feel absolutely terrible with how I have been treating him.. being distant and not wanting to have sex. And I know he has to feel that way based off of how I act but I am having a hard time dictating how I feel and why.

I don't think it is the relationship unless I just don't like being smothered with attention but it feels more than that. I quit my recent job because it was too emotionally draining and I feel like I want something but I just can't put my finger on what.

TL;DR: I'm having a hard time dealing with my personal issues and it's affecting my relationship. I'm scared of commitment, I'm feeling low and irritable, and I'm pushing my bf away. I don't know how to fix it and I feel terrible for how I'm treating him.

TITLE: I [23M] am seeing a girl [20F] unlike any girl I've ever seen before.

POST: I met a girl on OKCupid. We met up, clicked, and have been out around 10 times together now. We both live at our respective homes, me as I pay off my student loans, whereas she is a commuter at her university. 

We've expressed multiple times how it would be great to actually finish a date and spend the night together but sadly it just hasn't happened yet. We are exclusively seeing one another and I'm very happy.  

I am in a situation I've never been in before, as she is a very independent girl and I'm used to ones that are more communicative and open with what they are feeling and doing. I have a hard time trying to figure out what is going on in her mind. Because of this, I'm not sure if I'm being too distant or too clingy when I message her or see her. 

Can anyone else who has been in this situation before, shed some light on what they did to put themselves at ease while seeing someone independent? I like this girl a lot but don't want to scare her off by encroaching on her "me" time.

TL;DR: I'm seeing a girl who is very independent and I'm having trouble figuring out what's going on in her mind. I want to be respectful of her boundaries but also don't want to scare her off by being too distant. Any advice on how to navigate this situation?

COMMENTS:

* "I've been in a similar situation with someone who was very private. What I did was to respect her boundaries and not push her to talk about things she wasn't comfortable with. I also made sure to communicate my own feelings and needs clearly, so she knew what to expect from me. It's okay to not know everything, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Just be patient, and trust that she'll come to you when she's ready to open up more."
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing your own feelings and needs! It's easy to get caught up in trying to figure out someone else's thoughts and feelings, but it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being too. Maybe try having open and honest conversations with her about your feelings and needs, and see how she responds. It's possible that she's just not used to being in a relationship and needs some time to adjust."
* "I've found that with independent people, it's often not about being distant or clingy, but about respecting their boundaries and giving them space when they need it. Maybe try not putting too much pressure on the relationship and just enjoy the time you spend together. It's okay if it takes a little longer for her to open up - just be patient and focus on building a strong connection with her."

TITLE: (M/17) How to let go of a shitty friend (F/15)?

POST: I been friends with this cute girl for about a  2 years now. Although I am somewhat a little romantically in love with her (we hold hands, cuddle at home, give light kisses to each other but not  in the lips), I still get jealous when she hangs around with guys and does stuff without me. Although I care for her deeply.

So far she's been doing stuff that I don't agree with which includes doing illegal drugs, drinking alcohol excessively, having sex with other girls, and hanging out with the wrong type of people like the druggie, gang-banger, shady type of people. I feel like telling her parents or reporting her to the police for drug possession so that she can stop endangering herself with these type of people, since she is and acts far too young to be doing all this.

Even though she is one of my best friends and I tell her to stop doing these things but she goes on how I'm being a too much of a "goody goody" in her words, I no longer want to be associated with this type of person, but I cannot help my self to break contact with her since I see her everyday at school, we talk almost everyday, she lives near me, and she is the closest I ever had to a girlfriend. 

What can I do to ensure that I can successfully break away from her? And should I tell her parents about his?

TL;DR: I'm 17, in love with my 15-year-old friend who's into drugs, alcohol, and bad company. I want to break away from her, but I'm scared of losing her. Should I tell her parents or report her to the police?

**REDDIT RESPONSES:**

* "You're 17 and in love with a 15-year-old? That's illegal. You need to prioritize your own safety and well-being. It's not worth risking your future for someone who's not even legally an adult."
* "You're enabling her behavior by not telling her parents or the authorities. You're basically saying it's okay for her to continue doing these dangerous things. You need to take a step back and prioritize her safety."
* "You're not a 'goody goody' for wanting to protect her from harm. You're a responsible friend who cares about her well-being. Don't let her guilt trip you into staying in a toxic friendship."
* "You need to take a break from her and focus on your own life. You can't change her, but you can change how you react to her behavior. Prioritize your own happiness and well-being."
* "You're not a hero for trying to save her from herself. You're just a friend who cares about her. Let her parents or the authorities handle it. You don't have to be responsible for her safety."
* "You're 17, for crying out loud! You're still a kid yourself. You don't need to be responsible for someone else's safety. Focus on your own life and let the authorities handle it."

**CONCLUSION:**

The Reddit community is overwhelmingly in agreement that the OP (original poster) should prioritize his own safety and well-being, and not enable his friend's dangerous behavior. They advise him to take a step back from the friendship and focus on his own life, rather than trying to change his friend or take on the responsibility of protecting her from harm. The community also emphasizes that it's not his responsibility to report his friend to the authorities, but rather to prioritize his own well-being and seek help if needed. Overall, the responses are a mix of concern for the OP's safety, frustration with his friend's behavior, and a desire to see him prioritize his own well-being.

TITLE: My girlfriends Bday is coming up. I have access to a 3D printer. IDEAS!?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months and her b-day is coming up. I'd like to do something special for her. It's been a huge struggle to figure out what to buy/make for her as a present because she literally doesn't want ANYTHING. She is a very charitable person and is always looking into volunteering and donating. At first I was thinking of donating to a charity/organization of her choice, but I decided that I actually want to do something instead (or maybe along with donating). I have access to a 3D printer that my buddy owns so I was thinking of making something using that. However there are a couple of problems which is why I am making my plea to you redditors!

1) I have no artistic capabilities and can not graphically design anything. Thus it must be something that already exists (for example things from thingiverse.com) (Or if one of you amazing redditors can make me something that would be beyond amazing!)

2) I want it to be thoughtful and a tiny bit cheesy, but something that tailors to her charitable, nice, intelligent traits.

3) I have about 20 days to make and paint whatever object I decide upon.

Here are a few ideas I saw on thingiverse.com that caught my eye:
[Heart and Key](

[Nice Bracelet](

[Twisty Bracelet](

I looked around for a good subreddit for this and I feel like this is somewhat of a thought-provoking question, hence why I posted it here.

TL;DR: I'm looking for ideas for a 3D printed gift for my girlfriend's birthday. She's a charitable, intelligent, and nice person. I have access to a 3D printer and about 20 days to make and paint the object. I'm not artistic and need something that already exists or can be made by someone else. Something thoughtful, cheesy, and tailored to her traits would be perfect.

**Comments:**

* "Have you considered making a customized keychain with a message or her name on it? You could use a pre-made design and add a personal touch."
* "How about a customized phone case or laptop skin with a design that reflects her charitable nature? You could use a service like Redbubble or Society6."
* "I think the heart and key design is a great idea! You could also consider adding a small inscription or engraving to make it more personal."
* "What about a customized bookmark with a quote or message that resonates with her? You could use a pre-made design and add a personal touch."
* "I'm not sure if this is something you'd consider, but you could also look into 3D printing a customized prosthetic or assistive device for someone in need. It's a thoughtful and selfless gift that would really make a difference in someone's life."
* "Have you thought about making a customized picture frame or ornament with a special memory or inside joke between the two of you? It's a thoughtful and personalized gift that she'll cherish."
* "I think the twisty bracelet design is a great idea! You could also consider adding a small charm or pendant that represents her charitable nature, such as a tiny heart or a symbol of her favorite charity."
* "What about a customized journal or planner with a design that reflects her charitable nature? You could use a pre-made design and add a personal touch."
* "I'm not sure if this is something you'd consider, but you could also look into 3D printing a customized assistive device for someone with a disability. It's a thoughtful and selfless gift that would really make a difference in someone's life."

**Top-voted comment:**

* "Have you considered making a customized keychain with a message or her name on it? You could use a pre-made design and add a personal touch."

This comment suggests a simple yet thoughtful gift that can be customized with a message or her name, making it a unique and personalized gift. The idea of using a pre-made design and adding a personal touch is also a great way to overcome the OP's lack of artistic skills. The comment also highlights the importance of adding a personal touch to make the gift more meaningful and special.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my close friend [31 F] became intimate but now things are awkward.

POST: So I have been in a serious long term relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend and by serious I mean I am thinking about proposing within the next year.  However, about 2 years ago I met a really amazing girl, lets call her C.  C and I have been getting closer - we text regularly, are able to make fun of each other like I do with my bros, and we usually go out for drinks at least once a week (i let my gf know this of course).  We really connect as we have the same career (finance) and she is one of the more interesting individuals i have ever met and understands me (very few people do as I think I am quite complicated).  Anyways, the other night we went out for drinks and ended up at her place.  We had a few more drinks and we end up making out - this was one of the most passionate make-out sessions I've had in a long time.  The next morning, we sober up a bit and now things are a bit awkward and I feel like shit for cheating.  She says to me that if I have no intention of being with her, its best that we don't see each other anymore. She's out of town for the weekend as she has family matters to attend to and we will talk when she's back.  

I know this is selfish but I don't want to lose C as a friend and also don't want to break up with my current gf.  I'm aware that it's not fair to C but it feels like my best friend just suddenly died.  I'm not sure which direction to go ie 

1) break up, date C

2) Never talk or see C again

3) Do shit all and go with the flow

Any advice on what to say when I meet up with C or advice on what to do is appreciated, thanks.

TL;DR: I cheated on my girlfriend with a close friend (31F) and now things are awkward. I don't want to lose her as a friend or break up with my current girlfriend. I'm torn between options 1, 2, and 3. Help!

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're in a serious relationship and you've just cheated on your girlfriend. That's not okay. You need to decide what you want and be honest with yourself and your girlfriend. If you're not ready to commit to her, then maybe you're not ready for a serious relationship at all. As for C, you can't just use her as a rebound or a friend with benefits. You need to be honest with her too and let her know how you feel."
2. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Wow, you're really torn between options 1, 2, and 3? How about option 4: be a decent human being and own up to your actions? You cheated on your girlfriend and now you're trying to figure out how to make it work? That's not how relationships work. You need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about what happened and take responsibility for your actions. And as for C, you need to be honest with her too and let her know that you're not interested in pursuing anything romantic with her."
3. **u/relationship_advisor**: "I think you need to take a step back and assess your motivations. Why did you cheat on your girlfriend? Was it because you were unhappy in your relationship or was it because you were attracted to C? If it's the former, then maybe you need to re-evaluate your relationship and see if it's truly fulfilling for you. If it's the latter, then maybe you need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about your feelings. And as for C, you need to be honest with her too and let her know that you're not interested in pursuing anything romantic with her. You can't use her as a rebound or a friend with benefits. You need to be honest and respectful."

TITLE: I (27 F) shed a lot of hair and my boyfriend (37 F) wants me to pick up every single one of them in the bathroom each time.

POST: If you ever lived with a girl before or you are one, you should know that girls shed a lot and their loose strands can be found pretty much anywhere in the house. 

Understandably, my boyfriend gets incredibly annoyed that he finds so many of them in our bathroom. So now, every time I'm in the bathroom, I always make sure to pick a bunch of my loose hair on the ground and then throw it away. I also brush my hair daily to make sure that I can catch the loose hair before they drop to the ground.

I don't manage to pick up each and every loose strand in the bathroom and that's what he finds unacceptable. The bathroom floor has to be completely free of my hair but the problem is I shed a lot and so often that I can't be spending all of my time cleaning up all my hairs.

Is he being unreasonable?

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants me to pick up every single loose hair in the bathroom, but I shed a lot and it's hard for me to do that every time.

---

This post is an example of a common issue that many people face in their relationships: differing expectations and standards. The OP (original poster) is shedding a lot of hair, which is a normal and natural process, but her boyfriend is finding it unacceptable and wants her to pick up every single strand. The OP is reasonable in her approach, as she is already brushing her hair daily and picking up loose hair, but her boyfriend is being unreasonable in his expectations.

The post has received a lot of comments and reactions from users, with some people siding with the OP and others with the boyfriend. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* The importance of communication: Many users have emphasized the need for the couple to have an open and honest conversation about their expectations and standards.
* The natural process of shedding: Many users have pointed out that shedding is a natural process for women, and that it's unreasonable to expect the OP to pick up every single strand.
* The importance of compromise: Some users have suggested that the couple find a compromise, such as setting aside a specific time each day for the OP to clean up her hair, or finding a way to make it more manageable for her.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of communication, understanding, and compromise in relationships, and how even seemingly small issues can become major conflicts if not addressed in a constructive way.

TITLE: Hey, Reddit, I feel like I have a lot of repressed and most likely misplaced anger towards female gamers/nerds. People who may feel similar, do you consciously know why?

POST: Obviously, it can't be all that repressed if I'm making a thread about it right now. The anonymity helps me to speak about it more openly, I believe.

From that Nerdy Nummies chick on YouTube to pretty much 90% of the women I've raided with in WoW. Even the woman that I play with in league and know IRL irritate me greatly, even though I'd never admit it out loud.

The only motive I can think up that would make me so upset is that they are applauded for embracing their "geekdom" while most males are criticized. Which is pretty stupid since I like women and playing with them should be enjoyable. They tend to have pleasing voices and be more willing to play support roles(100% personal experience).

TL;DR: I have a lot of repressed anger towards female gamers/nerds and I'm trying to figure out why.

COMMENTS:

Comment 1:
I think you're onto something with the whole "applauded for embracing their geekdom" thing. It's like, women are expected to be feminine and not "nerdy" or "gamer-y", so when they do show interest in those things, it's seen as a big deal and they get praised for it. Meanwhile, men are expected to be into those things, so it's not a big deal. It's like, women are getting special treatment for doing something that's supposed to be normal for men.

Comment 2:
I think you're also experiencing a bit of internalized misogyny. You're saying that women are "more willing to play support roles" and that they have "pleasing voices", which is a pretty stereotypical and objectifying way to talk about women. It's like, you're reducing them to their physical appearance and abilities, rather than seeing them as individuals with their own personalities and strengths.

Comment 3:
I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself, OP. It's okay to have feelings and biases, and it's great that you're acknowledging them and trying to work through them. The important thing is that you're recognizing that your feelings are based on societal expectations and stereotypes, rather than any inherent qualities of women.

Comment 4:
I think you're also experiencing a bit of FOMO (fear of missing out). You're feeling left out because women are getting praised for being "nerdy" and you're not, so you're lashing out at them. It's like, you're feeling like you're not good enough or cool enough, so you're taking it out on the women who are doing what you wish you could do.

Comment 5:
I think you're being a bit too critical of yourself, OP. It's okay to have feelings and biases, and it's great that you're acknowledging them and trying to work through them. The important thing is that you're recognizing that your feelings are based on societal expectations and stereotypes, rather than any inherent qualities of women.

TITLE: I [29 M] don't think I'm falling in love with my [28 F] new gf, same as last time. Worried I've got a pattern

POST: Been seeing this girl for about a month, but we're not committed because I told her I'm not ready. She wants to be in a committed relationship. 

She's had enough experience to know she won't have sex until then, which is okay with me (though not how I usually do it). 

We have a lot in common: get along, have similar interests, etc. She's pretty cute and just finished grad school. I guess she fits the bill.

But I'm just not that excited about it. Lukewarm.

Back in January I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months for the same reason, and a year ago I did the same with a girl of 2 months. All 3 girls wanted to keep dating me. 

There have been a few girls I've been excited about after a date or two, but they weren't that into me.

I'm afraid I'm victim to the old Groucho Marx quote, "I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member."

These girls are catches and I'm beating myself up for not being that into them.

Maybe this is normal and just called dating. Should I break up with current girl right now? 

Do I just need to be patient and wait for feelings to build? That didn't work last time.

Should I just be patient and hold out until a girl knocks my socks off? I think I've really gotta "fall" for them. But maybe my standards are too high.

TL;DR: I'm 29, dating a 28-year-old girl for a month, but I'm not feeling the love. I've done this before with other girls who wanted to be in a committed relationship. I'm worried I've got a pattern of not being into the girls I'm supposed to be into. Should I break up with her or just be patient and wait for feelings to build?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not alone in this feeling. It's normal to not feel an instant connection with someone, especially if you're not used to being in a committed relationship. Give it some time and see how things develop. It's possible that your feelings will grow stronger over time."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You don't have to 'fall' in love with someone. You can just enjoy the process of getting to know each other and see where things go. Don't worry about what others think, just focus on what makes you happy."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not a bad person for not feeling an instant connection with someone. It's okay to take your time and get to know someone before deciding if you're interested in a committed relationship. Don't beat yourself up over it."
* "I think you should break up with her. If you're not feeling the love, then it's not fair to keep her around. You're not doing yourself or her any favors by staying in a relationship that's not working for you."
* "I think you should try to communicate with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she's feeling the same way and you can work through it together. Don't assume that you're the only one who's not feeling the love."
* "I think you're being too focused on the idea of 'falling in love'. Maybe you're just not wired that way. Maybe you're more of a'slow burn' kind of person. Don't worry about it, just enjoy the process and see where things go."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want in a relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your deal-breakers? Once you have a better idea of what you're looking for, you can start to make decisions about whether or not this relationship is right for you."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to feel a certain way. You don't have to 'fall' in love with someone. You can just enjoy the process of getting to know each other and see where things go. Don't worry about what others think, just focus on what makes you happy." (This comment was repeated multiple times)

The comments on this post are varied, but most people are trying to reassure the OP that it's normal to not feel an instant connection with someone, and that it's okay to take your time and get to know each other before deciding if you're interested in a committed relationship. Some people suggest communicating with the current girlfriend about how you're feeling, while others suggest taking time to reflect on what you want in a relationship. A few people suggest breaking up with the current girlfriend if you're not feeling the love, but most people are against that idea. Overall, the comments are trying to be supportive and encouraging, and to help the OP feel less anxious about his feelings.

TITLE: My [24M] gf [20F] sent me a really cryptic message about something she wants to talk about, but won't talk right now

POST: I'm currently long distance with my gf for about two months since she's interning elsewhere. Last Friday I went to a workshop in another city (and am still here), and I noticed she just ceased all communication over the weekend. I sent her some messages asking what's going on, and she finally responded last night with the following sequence of messages.

her: Ill talk to u when u get back from dc

me: huh why

her: I have something i want to talk to u about but not while youre there so ill wait for u to come back first

me: i can Skype you now

her: No, ill talk to u when youre back

me: why does it matter where I'm at

her: Oh, didnt see this
Ill just talk to u when u get back, i dont want to talk about it right now

me: you said that already

her: I dont have anything else to say atm

I'm going back home in two days (to my place, not where she's currently at), but I can't stop thinking about this today, and it's distracting me from other things. I don't really want to press her further if she's unwilling to talk, but on the other hand I need a better understanding of what's going on right now.. if someone can help me decipher the cryptic messages she sent, it would be much appreciated.

We've been apart for nearing two months now but I have a flight to visit her in a little under two weeks.

TL;DR: GF sent me cryptic messages saying she wants to talk to me when I get back from a workshop, but won't talk right now. I'm worried and can't stop thinking about it. Help me decipher what's going on.

---

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's trying to avoid talking about something specific while you're in DC. Maybe it's something that's related to your relationship or something that happened while you were apart. I would try to respect her boundaries and wait until you're back home to talk to her. It's possible that she just needs some time to process her thoughts and feelings before discussing it with you."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She just wants to talk to you when you're back home, maybe she's just feeling overwhelmed or stressed and needs some time to herself. Don't read too much into it, just wait until you're back and have a conversation with her then."
* "I've been in similar situations before and it's usually something minor. Maybe she just forgot to send you a birthday card or something. Try not to worry too much about it and just wait until you're back home to talk to her."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about this. Ask her what's going on and why she's being so secretive. It's possible that there's something going on that she's not telling you and you deserve to know the truth."
* "I think you're being too anxious about this. She's just trying to avoid talking about something specific while you're in DC, that's all. Try to relax and just wait until you're back home to talk to her. It's not the end of the world."

TITLE: Deep physical and emotional connection...but we don't want a relationship? Can someone explain?

POST: I (male, 26) have a very good friend (female, 25) that I've recently gotten much closer to. Over the past month and a half or so we've come to realize that we are able to communicate and understand each other on a deeper level than with anyone else. We are incredibly similar, in all of the ways that truly matter. We see each other usually a few times a week, and talk every day, for most of the day, including at night for several hours. 
We're also both physically attracted to one another, but she is just coming off of a breakup with a long term partner, and I am recently divorced, so we don't want to do anything with one another right now. But the desire is there.

The thing is, though, that we both agree...we don't feel like we want to be in a romantic relationship with one another. We don't want to "date". It seems...weird to us. 

So my question is, what is this relationship? If we get along so well, have such a profound connection, spend so much time together, and are physically attracted to each other, why do we not feel like we want to date each other?

TL;DR: I have a deep emotional and physical connection with a friend, but we don't want to date. What is this relationship?

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're experiencing a deep and meaningful friendship. You've found someone who understands and connects with you on a deep level, and that's something to be cherished. You don't need to label it as a romantic relationship to appreciate the value of your friendship."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just because you're physically attracted to each other doesn't mean you need to act on it. You can still maintain a strong friendship without pursuing a romantic relationship. It's okay to have boundaries and not feel pressured to label your relationship."
* "I've been in a similar situation with a close friend. We had a deep connection, but we both knew we weren't ready for a romantic relationship. We decided to focus on our friendship and see where it takes us. It's not uncommon for people to have strong connections with friends that don't necessarily translate to romance."
* "It's possible that you're both just not ready for a romantic relationship right now. You've both been through significant life changes, and you're still processing those emotions. Your friendship is a safe space for you both to connect and support each other without the pressure of a romantic relationship."
* "I think you're missing the point. Just because you don't want to date each other doesn't mean you can't have a deep and meaningful connection. You can still have a strong friendship and maintain a physical attraction without pursuing a romantic relationship. It's not uncommon for people to have strong feelings for friends without wanting to act on them."

**Themes:**

* The importance of understanding and respecting each other's boundaries and desires
* The value of deep and meaningful friendships
* The complexity of human emotions and relationships
* The possibility of having strong connections with friends that don't necessarily translate to romance
* The importance of communication and honesty in relationships

**Takeaways:**

* It's okay to have strong connections with friends that don't necessarily translate to romance.
* Respect each other's boundaries and desires, even if they differ from your own.
* Deep and meaningful friendships can be just as valuable and fulfilling as romantic relationships.
* Communication and honesty are key to maintaining a strong and healthy relationship, regardless of its label.

TITLE: Things to do in Vienna?

POST: In end of September or start of October girlfriend and I are going to Vienna. My cousin has a flat there so accommodation is taken care of as well as transport (train). Thing is I really don't know what is there to see apart form Madame Tussaud, Prater and Starbucks which girlfriend insists we go there (there are non in my country). Heard also something about the Zoo, is it worth it? We are planing on 5 day stay and we want to cover as much city as possible so if any one can list a local website for public transport that would be great or any info sites(aside of vienna info) Apart from all the sights any good restaurants near the center (or main train station as the flat is somewhere near) or any local pubs where young people like to gather? If any one can list a bit ''less tourist-y'' locations or less known yet still interesting it would be also great. 
I don't speak German well, is it possible to communicate with locals in English? Girlfriend does speak German but I'd like to participate in talking. And what are prices in general there?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are going to Vienna for 5 days, accommodation and transport are taken care of. Need recommendations on what to see, do, eat and drink. Also, info on public transport and communicating with locals in English.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/AustrianLocal**: Ah, Vienna is a great city! You're in luck because the city has a lot to offer, and I'm happy to help you plan your trip.

First of all, let me tell you that Madame Tussauds is not really a must-see in Vienna. Instead, you should definitely visit the Schönbrunn Palace and Gardens, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's a beautiful palace with stunning gardens, and it's a great place to learn about the history of the Habsburgs.

The Prater is a great place to visit, especially if you're interested in amusement parks. You can ride the famous Ferris wheel, and there are plenty of other attractions to enjoy.

As for the Zoo, it's definitely worth a visit. It's one of the oldest and most famous zoos in the world, and it's home to over 700 species of animals.

For public transport, you can use the Wiener Linien website to plan your route. It's easy to use, and you can even buy tickets online.

As for restaurants near the center, I recommend trying some traditional Austrian cuisine like Wiener Schnitzel or Sacher Torte. There are plenty of great restaurants near the main train station, and you can also try some of the street food vendors.

If you're looking for a local pub where young people like to gather, I recommend checking out the Naschmarkt, which is a popular market with plenty of food stalls and bars. It's a great place to meet locals and try some new foods.

As for communicating with locals in English, most Viennese people speak English fluently, so you shouldn't have any problems. However, it's always a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in German, like "Hallo" (hello), "Danke" (thank you), and "Auf Wiedersehen" (goodbye).

Prices in Vienna are generally quite high, but there are plenty of affordable options if you know where to look. A meal at a mid-range restaurant will cost around 15-20 euros per person, and a beer will cost around 3-5 euros.

I hope this helps, and I wish you a great trip to Vienna!

2. **u/Traveler123**: Hi there! I'm a big fan of Vienna, and I'm happy to help you plan your trip.

First of all, let me tell you that the city has a lot to offer, and you'll definitely want to visit some of the famous landmarks like St. Stephen's Cathedral and the Hofburg Palace. You should also check out the MuseumsQuartier, which is a complex of museums and art galleries that's definitely worth a visit.

As for the Zoo, it's definitely worth a visit. It's home to over 700 species of animals, and it's a great place to learn about wildlife conservation.

TITLE: Me [mid twenties/F] with my overseas family--is it okay if I don't make initiative anymore now that several months have passed by since I last saw them?

POST: I love them dearly and our family is very close despite the distance, but because of my headspace (ADHD and past history with PTSD and anxiety) several months later, I don't feel connected like I used to because I haven't seen them for such a long time and my memories have drastically faded since it's been half a year now.  

I used to reach out a lot, but now I don't feel the need to reach out at all.  Is it okay if I don't make the initiative with them anymore now that several months have passed by since I last saw them?  I'll probably see them again in less than a year.  I don't want it to seem like I'm upset at them or anything, I just feel like my 'needs' have changed.

TL;DR: I haven't seen my overseas family in several months and my memories have faded. I used to make an effort to stay in touch, but now I don't feel the need to. Is it okay if I don't make the initiative anymore until I see them again in less than a year?

**Comments:**

* "Hey OP, it's totally okay to take a break and focus on yourself. You've been dealing with a lot, and it's normal for your priorities to shift. Just make sure to communicate with your family about how you're feeling, so they're not left wondering what's going on. Maybe send them a quick update or a funny meme to let them know you're still thinking of them."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and taking care of yourself. It's not selfish to prioritize your own needs, especially when you're dealing with mental health issues. Just be honest with your family about how you're feeling, and I'm sure they'll understand. You can always reach out when you're feeling more connected."
* "OP, I think you're being really honest with yourself, and that's admirable. It's okay to not feel the same level of connection as you did before, especially with the distance and your mental health struggles. Just make sure to keep the lines of communication open, and you can always reach out when you're feeling more connected. Don't worry too much about what others think – you do you!"
* "I think it's important to remember that your family loves you and wants to stay connected, but they also understand that life gets busy and priorities change. If you're not feeling the need to reach out, that's okay. Just make sure to check in with them periodically and let them know you're thinking of them. You can always send a quick text or make a phone call to catch up."
* "OP, I think you're being really realistic about your situation. It's not always easy to maintain relationships, especially when there's distance involved. Just be honest with your family about how you're feeling, and I'm sure they'll understand. You can always reach out when you're feeling more connected, and I'm sure they'll be happy to hear from you."

TITLE: I[18F] do not know what to do with my boyfriend[20M] of a year and a half, with him going away for school.

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. And everything is perfectly fine. We have a great relationship with no problems, never broke up. We're really happy!  

He's a junior in college and I'm a freshman in college, I commute to a local university and he went away to school then came back  commuted to a community college for a year and now he recently got into a university where he has to go away again. We talked about it and I was really upset but I understand it's what he has to do. 

It's not even distance will be the problem, it's not that far away at all, Problem is, is that he's never been single going in college and wants to try it out. He's been in relationships starting from like his sophomore year of high school. He dated a girl for 6 months, then dated a girl for 2 years, and then met me right after and we instantly clicked. But on the other hand he said really loves being with me and what we have is really good! 

He doesn't know what to do. I do not know what to do.  He knows if he breaks up with me it will probably never be the same and that he will miss me, but he's telling me that he's so unsure it's eating him up. He said he kind of wants to realize he needs me by being away but I really want to stay together and see how it works out and then decide. He leaves in a week. What do you guys think we should do? Anyone have any similar stories or went through the same thing? Opinions?

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 1.5 years is going away to school and wants to try being single for a bit. He's unsure and I'm unsure too. He's worried about losing me if he breaks up with me, but he's also unsure if he's ready to commit to a long-distance relationship. We're both torn. What do you guys think we should do?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is trying to figure out what he wants. He's been in relationships since high school and never had a chance to be single. It's normal to feel unsure about what he wants. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. Let him know that you understand he needs space, but you also need to know where you stand in his life. Maybe you can come to a compromise, like setting a timeline for when he'll reassess his feelings and make a decision about your relationship."
2. **relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you're having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. However, it's also important to prioritize your own feelings and needs. If you're not comfortable with the idea of him being single for a bit, it might be worth considering whether this relationship is truly right for you. Remember that you deserve to be with someone who is committed to you and willing to work through challenges together."
3. **longdistanceproblems**: "I went through a similar situation with my ex. He wanted to take a break and figure out what he wanted, but it ended up being a long-distance relationship that ultimately didn't work out. My advice would be to set clear boundaries and expectations with your boyfriend. If he's going to be away for a bit, make sure you both agree on how often you'll communicate and what the expectations are for the relationship. It's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of the relationship."
4. **confusedbuttrying**: "I'm going through something similar with my partner. We're both in college and we're trying to figure out what we want. My advice would be to take things one day at a time and focus on communicating openly and honestly with each other. It's okay to be unsure, and it's okay to take time to figure things out. Just make sure you're both on the same page and willing to work through the challenges together."
5. **relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're having this conversation with your boyfriend. It takes a lot of courage to be honest and open about your feelings. My advice would be to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and what you both bring to the table. Remember that relationships are about growth and evolution, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Just make sure you're both willing to work through the challenges together and prioritize your own happiness."

TITLE: I [25 F] went out with this guy[25 M] and now I fell in love with him..

POST: We're known each other from the internet for 7 years, exchanged pics, talked a lot in the past on the internet, liked each other a lot, but in the last 2 years, none of us kept in touch. 

We work in different cities, 6-7 hours car distance. 

A few months ago, my job offered me the opportunity to work in his city, for 5 months. One week before I left, I contacted him and asked him out; he didn't know I was there. He accepted and we stayed like 6 hours to talk without any sexual or romantic topic. 

At the end of the "date" he asked me when I'm coming back and he said that "now you have my number, you can call me at any time". And I told him that maybe we will see each other again and he said "of course we will" and that's it, he hadn't contacted me since and I don't know if I shoud do it, but I dont wanna push things... 

Now a little of myself: I'm recently out of a 5 year relationship and planned to relocate in that city and I feel stuck with this guy in my mind, because he is as I always known him: smart, interesting, people person, handsome etc. 

The relocation means professional oportunities for me, but I'm not sure my boss will let me go and lately I also consider relocation for this guy but when I try to conclude things, I get extremely confused because I'm not sure he likes me more than an old internet buddy

TL;DR: I went out with a guy I've known online for 7 years, we reconnected and I fell in love with him, but he hasn't contacted me since our "date" and I don't know if I should make the first move.

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you gotta make the first move! You've already taken the risk of going out with him, now you gotta see if he's interested in you romantically. Don't wait for him to make the first move, you'll be stuck in limbo forever"
* "I agree with the above comment. You've already put yourself out there, now it's time to see if he's interested. But also, don't be too hard on yourself if he doesn't feel the same way. You've been out of a 5-year relationship and it's normal to feel stuck"
* "I think you should give him some space. He's been busy with work and life, maybe he's just not thinking about you romantically right now. Don't be too quick to assume he's not interested, give him some time to process his feelings"
* "I think you should try to get to know him better before making any moves. You've only had one 'date' and you don't really know if you're compatible. Take some time to talk to him, hang out with him, and see if you have a real connection"
* "Honestly, if he's not making an effort to contact you after your 'date', it might be a sign that he's not interested. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to get to know you better"

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thank you all for your comments! I think I'll take the advice of making the first move, but I'm also going to give him some space. I don't want to come on too strong and scare him off. I'll try to send him a casual text and see how he responds. I appreciate your honesty and advice, it's helping me to clear my head and think more clearly about this situation"

TITLE: I [24M] am afraid to become over-attached to [22F]

POST: We have dated for 5 month now and she is my official GF for 1,5month and I am afraid I might get over-attached and that I am turning into someone I do not want to be. One example, an old-highschool friend visited her and they went out partying (I went somewhere else) and he spent the night at her place (we dont live together and he doesnt live close). I am totally okay with that and I know that since she only has one huge bed and no couch that he slept in one bed with her. I trust her and I know that she would never cheat on me but still I become paranoid. She accidentally called me by his name today (and she was so embarrassed and sorry) and that freaked me the fuck out. I know that she loves me a lot and she told me that she never felt that much in love before and I believe her. Why do I still become paranoid? I couldnt sleep tonight because I was creating scenarios in my head in which she cheated on me or something else bad happened.

Do I have self-esteem issues or something?

I am someone who needs a lot of freedom in relationships. If I wanted to visit a female friend and platonically spend the night and I couldn't because my GF wouldnt let me, I would be so annoyed, so it seems just natural to me to give her the same freedom I am expecting of her but why can't I just be cooler about this? It feels like my emotional shields protecting me from my own paranoia are completely shut down. It feels a little like I am tripping out on MDMA or something.

TL;DR: I'm 24M, dating 22F for 5 months. I'm afraid of becoming over-attached and paranoid. I trust her, but still get anxious about her interactions with other guys. I feel like I'm losing my emotional shields and becoming someone I don't want to be.

TITLE: Mediocre problem with my "girlfriend" or whatever you may call it.

POST: So.. this seems like a very mediocre problem but it has been bothering me for the longest time.

1. We've been together for about four months. 
2. She isn't my girlfriend. She says she doesn't like the title of being a girlfriend and that her first boyfriend was awful. So she was only "dating" the previous "boyfriends" she has had. (So technically she has only had 1 boyfriend and the other guys were just relationships)
3. She never has time or makes the time (She says she's incredibly busy). We probably hang out about every two weeks unless I push hard for some time to hang out. 
4. I don't know what else. She's someone I thought I would actually like and it kind of just happened. Before, she used to think I was this cool, super outgoing person (things she said before I had an interest in her) while she was this super shy girl (who actually seemed to waver on the social side). But now I'm interested in her in ways I never would've thought because of her personality and her drive and how different and unique she is to just about any other girl I have ever dated. 
5. I'm also afraid that maybe we moved too fast. Was sex on first date bad? Did it make it so it becomes hard to build a relationship since there was no tension building up on it?
6. She has never introduced me to anybody and shoos me out whenever she is expecting anybody. 
*I just want to build that she is the type that spent her life alone from middle school to high school. Would this be the reason she treats me so? 
7. Am I just a fuck buddy to her?

The real question I'm asking is whether she isn't making the time for me because she genuinely doesn't have an interest for me and I should end the relationship or make some kind of ultimatum. Or if it is because she really is busy and really doesn't expect much time out of our relationship but she actually does hold an interest. We also live only about 3 blocks away from each other.

TL;DR: Mediocre problem: Girlfriend doesn't make time for me, says she's busy, never introduces me to anyone, and we only hang out every two weeks. Is she just a fuck buddy or is she genuinely interested?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're being way too invested in this. You've only been together for 4 months and she's not even calling you her boyfriend. You're basically just a casual thing to her. If you want more, you need to have a real conversation with her about your expectations."
* "I think you're reading too much into this. She's just busy, that's all. Maybe she's going through a tough time or has a lot on her plate. Don't assume the worst just yet."
* "I agree with the first commenter. You're not even in a committed relationship and you're already feeling like you're being treated like a fuck buddy. You need to take a step back and reevaluate what you want from this relationship."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. Maybe she's just not used to having someone in her life and is still figuring things out. Give her some space and see if things improve."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that sometimes we just don't know how to handle relationships or we're still figuring out what we want. Maybe she's not ready for a serious relationship and that's okay. You deserve better than to be treated like a casual thing."
* "You need to have a conversation with her about your feelings and expectations. Don't assume she knows what you want or need. Be open and honest and see how she responds."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just enjoy the time you have with her and don't put too much pressure on it. You never know what the future holds."
* "I agree with the first commenter. You're not even in a real relationship and you're already feeling like you're being treated like a fuck buddy. You need to take a step back and reevaluate what you want from this relationship."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. Maybe she's just not used to having someone in her life and is still figuring things out. Give her some space and see if things improve."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are a mix of advice and opinions, with some people suggesting that the OP should have a conversation with his "girlfriend" about his feelings and expectations, while others think he's overthinking the situation and should just enjoy the time he has with her. Some people are more sympathetic to the OP's concerns, while others think he's being too hard on himself. Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what he wants from the relationship and communicate his feelings to his partner.

TITLE: My girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months is scared that i [22 M], might cheat on her!

POST: My girlfriend is in another country for a few months and she is scared whenever i go out that i might cheat on her with someone. I love her a lot and i would never even think about doing such thing, i'm always telling her where im going, we are texting basically 24/7 and video chatting etc. I sometimes send her pictures from the places i go to and the people i am with. 

But today she told me that whenever i go out she is thinking that i might cheat on her. I told her that her insecurity might cause problems in the future. I don't know why she would think like this, i would do everything for this girl. 
I asked her if in the past releationship someone cheated on her, but she said no, but who knows what happened right? Maybe she was the one cheating and now she is worried that it will come back to her or something... Any ideas on how to solve this problem?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 6 months is scared that i might cheat on her, even though i'm always honest and open with her. I don't know why she's thinking this way and I'm worried it might cause problems in the future.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like your girlfriend is struggling with trust issues. It's not uncommon for people to have trust issues, especially if they've been hurt in past relationships. You can try having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Let her know that you value your relationship and that you're committed to being honest and transparent with her. You can also suggest that you both work on building trust together, by setting boundaries and communicating openly with each other."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's great that you're being honest and open with your girlfriend, but it's also important to understand that trust is a two-way street. You can't just assume that she's being paranoid or insecure without trying to understand where she's coming from. Have you asked her what specifically is making her feel this way? Is there something in particular that's triggering her fears? Try to have a non-judgmental conversation with her and see if you can get to the root of the issue."
3. **u/honestyiskey**: "I think you're being a bit too quick to dismiss her concerns. Just because you're being honest and open with her doesn't mean that she's not justified in feeling worried. You need to take her concerns seriously and try to understand where she's coming from. Maybe there's something specific that's making her feel insecure, like a past experience or a fear of abandonment. Try to have a conversation with her about what's really going on and see if you can work together to build trust and understanding."
4. **u/communicationiskey**: "I think you're both just not communicating effectively. You're saying that you're being honest and open with her, but she's still feeling insecure. Maybe you're not being as clear or specific as you think you are. Try to have a conversation with her about what she needs from you in terms of communication and reassurance. Maybe she needs more frequent updates or more detailed information about where you're going and who you're with. See if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
5. **u/trustissues**: "I think you're both struggling with trust issues. It's not uncommon for people to have trust issues, especially in relationships. You can try having a conversation with your girlfriend about your own trust issues and see if you can work together to build trust and understanding. Maybe you both need to work on building trust with each other, rather than just assuming that the other person is trustworthy."

TITLE: [25/m] Enamored of my best friend's sister [21/f]

POST: Using a throwaway just to be safe. Mostly.

I've known one of my friends for around 10 years, and though we no longer live near each other, I make an effort to spend time with her a few times a year. She's practically a sister to me. In that time I've become close to her family, including one of her sisters, let's call her Olivia.

Olivia may or may not have been fond of me for some time. In recent years, my friend sent me teasing texts like, "When are you visiting again? Olivia misses you." At the time, I liked Olivia as much as one likes any annoying-but-somehow-endearing younger sisters of your best friend, so I rolled my eyes and humored her. I figured it was a phase, and it probably was.

Well, as it happens, I hate myself; Olivia has grown on me. After teasing Olivia through her college years for being in a related discipline embroiled in a conflict with my own, she switched to my major. Funny, that. Having the ability to share in obtuse conversations certainly enabled us to spend more time together, and I find myself stupidly grinning at even the worst of her puns.

Fast forward to the present. Olivia and I are both graduating in the spring. Part of me knows that keeping my mouth shut is the safer course of action, and much of this could just be me projecting, but I still want to open up to my friend before we all part ways. I'm trying to conceive how best to broach the topic with her, as it's going to be awkward regardless. I know all the risks involved, and I even considered the cataclysmic scenario in which it's my friend and not her sister who has feelings for me, which is ridiculous, but you know what they say about truth and fiction.

TL;DR: I'm 25, and I've developed feelings for my best friend's 21-year-old sister. I'm torn between keeping it to myself and potentially ruining our friendship or risking everything to confess. I'm seeking advice on how to approach this situation.

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 25 and she's 21. That's a huge age gap. You're basically a grown man and she's still in her early twenties. You need to think about the power dynamic here and how it could affect your friendship with your friend."
* "I get that you're close with your friend, but you're also close with Olivia. Have you considered talking to her about how you feel? Maybe she feels the same way and you can explore something together."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest with your friend and tell her how you feel. If she's okay with it, then you can all figure out what to do next. If not, then you can still maintain your friendship with your friend."
* "You're being ridiculous. You're not going to ruin your friendship with your friend just because you have feelings for her sister. Just be honest and see what happens."
* "I think you should consider the potential consequences of your actions. You're not just risking your friendship with your friend, you're also risking your friendship with Olivia's family. You need to think about how this could affect everyone involved."
* "I'm not sure what to say. I think you should talk to your friend and see how she feels about it. But I also think you should be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way, and you need to be okay with that."
* "I think you're being selfish. You're not thinking about how this could affect Olivia or your friend. You're just thinking about your own feelings. You need to consider everyone else's feelings before you do anything."

TITLE: My cousin [f31] is getting married in June and asked me [f21] to be her maid of honour. I have no free time and don't know what to do

POST: So my cousin is getting married and while I'm really happy for her I don't think I'm responsible enough to take on the MOH role. I'm in school and also have a job. I've never even been to a wedding! Her friends organized a surprise engagement party for her and I feel horrible for not partaking. I just feel an immense amount of pressure and to be honest I don't necessarily want the responsibility. 

My cousin knows this, yet still gives me hints that I should start organizing something. I don't even know where to begin. I have too much on my plate right now really need to get my shit together. I know she will get really upset if I tell her I can't do it. 

What do I do Reddit?

TL;DR: I'm asked to be my cousin's maid of honour but I have no free time and don't know what to do. I'm worried about disappointing her and don't want the responsibility. Help!

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "Have an open and honest conversation with your cousin about your concerns and limitations. It's better to be upfront and honest than to take on too much and risk burning out."
* "Offer to help with smaller tasks or responsibilities, such as helping with decorations or planning the bachelorette party. This way, you can still be involved in the wedding planning process without feeling overwhelmed."
* "Suggest that your cousin consider asking someone else to be the maid of honour. It's okay to say no to a role that you don't feel you can fulfill."

TITLE: Insecure about every opinion I have about art and entertainment

POST: I'm extremely worried about my opinions on anything related to music, movies, books, shows, or otherwise related to matters of taste and culture.  I'm worried that I'll say the wrong thing and that what I like or dislike will somehow reflect negatively on my intelligence or worth.  There's a sizeable chunk of the internet that seems to hold an unwritten notion that the minority of smart people like one set of things and the "idiot masses" like another set of things and never the twain shall meet.  I don't know if I'm smart or if I'm part of the ostensibly vast masses of idiots that are, according to various rants I've read, apparently responsible for the death of culture and the plummeting quality of everything.

To make things more difficult, I don't know which opinion I read on something is the "smart" opinion.  So I don't even know what I should even be looking for.  All I know is I've seen a couple of movies recently and I've been scared to death to say anything about them lest I confirm my nagging doubts about my intelligence and perception (or, rather, lack thereof).

TL;DR: I'm worried about my opinions on art and entertainment because I'm unsure if they're "smart" or not, and I'm scared to say anything lest I be seen as an idiot.

COMMENT 1:
Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from. It's like, you're worried that if you say something "wrong" about a movie or book, people will think you're not cultured or intelligent. But here's the thing: there's no one "right" opinion about art. It's all subjective, and what matters is that you're thinking critically about what you're consuming.

I think it's awesome that you're taking the time to reflect on your opinions and consider different perspectives. That's what makes you a thoughtful and engaged consumer of art. And honestly, most people don't care what you think about a movie or book. They're just trying to enjoy it for themselves.

So, don't be afraid to share your thoughts! You might be surprised at how many people share your opinions or have similar reactions to the same piece of art. And if someone does disagree with you, that's okay too. It's all part of the conversation.

Remember, there's no such thing as a "smart" or "dumb" opinion about art. There's just your opinion, and that's what makes it valuable.

COMMENT 2:
I completely understand where you're coming from. I've been there too, where I'm worried about what others will think of my opinions. But here's the thing: your opinions are valid, regardless of what others think. You have the right to like or dislike something, and that's okay.

TITLE: I [24 M] am very certain my gf [20] is going to break up with me tomorrow. What would you do?

POST: We've been together almost two years now and it's only recently been getting really rocky. 

I screwed up a an outing (concert) by getting too drunk and not really knowing the what was going on. 

It wasn't the first time I got too wasted, but never liked to drink before, she kinda reintroduced me into it. I accept responsibility though. 

She said she didn't know how to feel about us anymore and wanted time off. 

I've been devastated ever since. I left town to visit relatives the day after and am returning home tonight. 

In that town, our mutual friend is there who happens to be my gfs best friend. I contacted her to ask for advice. 

Gf told me she found that unattractive and immature of me, I told her I was just in search of a way to fix the problem because I love her so dearly. 

She asked if I was back in town, I said no. She asked me to tell her when I get back because we'll have to talk... 

What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is going to break up with me tomorrow. I got drunk at a concert and she's been distant ever since. I reached out to her best friend for advice, which she didn't like. What should I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're already in a bad place and you're just making things worse by contacting her best friend for advice. You need to take some time to reflect on your actions and how they've affected your girlfriend. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want out of this relationship before you try to 'fix' things."
2. **u/sadpanda123**: "I think you should be honest with yourself and acknowledge that you're not taking responsibility for your actions. You got drunk and made a mistake, and now you're trying to shift the blame onto your girlfriend. You need to own up to your mistakes and apologize sincerely. If she's still not willing to work through this, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "It sounds like you're in a lot of emotional pain right now, and I'm sorry to hear that. However, I have to advise you to take a step back and assess the situation objectively. You got drunk, you made a mistake, and your girlfriend is upset. That's not a reason to break up, but it's definitely a reason to have a serious conversation about boundaries and communication. If you're really invested in this relationship, you need to be willing to work through the tough times and have open and honest conversations with your girlfriend."
4. **u/throwaway456789**: "I think you should just be honest with yourself and admit that you're not ready for a serious relationship. You're still figuring out who you are and what you want, and that's okay. But don't try to 'fix' things or make excuses for your behavior. Just be honest with your girlfriend and tell her that you're not ready for a commitment. It's better to be honest and upfront than to try to manipulate the situation or make excuses for your actions."

**Original poster's response:** "Thank you all for your honest and helpful advice. I think I need to take some time to reflect on my actions and how they've affected my girlfriend. I'll try to be more responsible and communicate better in the future. And if things don't work out, I'll be okay with that too. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: Carpooling is financially beneficial, but I can't deal with my coworker all day long every day

POST: My coworker and I have to drive to a city over an hour away every day for work. So financially it makes sense for us to take turns driving. The problem is, I can't stand this guy all day long. I come home from work every day exhausted--not from the work but from being around my coworker for the whole day.

He talks too much, either about meaningless bullshit or really, really weird things for which there are no good responses. He complains all the time about who's not doing enough work or how others are doing their jobs, etc, no matter how many times I tell him to quit worrying about everyone else and just do his own work. And this is all made worse by the fact that we have to get up really early to be at work on time and I do not do well with that.

Frankly, it'd be worth the financial hit to not have to spend every day with this guy.

Anyone have any advice on how I can nicely break the carpooling setup or something? He likes me a lot and he's the one who got me this job, so I don't want to be mean and tell him the honest reason why I don't want to drive with him every day.

TL;DR: I have to carpool with my coworker every day for work, but I can't stand him. He talks too much, complains too much, and it's exhausting. I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I need a break from him. How can I nicely break the carpooling setup?

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Have you considered just taking turns driving, but not every day? Maybe alternate days or weeks? That way you can still save money and time, but also get a break from each other. You could also try setting some boundaries, like 'I'm only willing to listen to your complaints for 15 minutes a day, then I need some quiet time'."
2. **u/username123**: "I'd suggest having a calm, non-confrontational conversation with your coworker about your concerns. You could say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate you getting me this job, but I'm finding it tough to spend so much time with you every day. Would it be okay if we took turns driving or found another carpool buddy?' He might not even realize how much he's dominating the conversation."
3. **u/throwawayaccount99**: "I'm a big fan of the 'gray rock' method. When he starts talking about something you're not interested in, just remain silent and expressionless. It's hard to keep the conversation going when the other person isn't engaging. You could also try asking him questions about himself, but only if you're genuinely interested. This can help shift the focus away from his complaints and onto more interesting topics."
4. **u/username456**: "Have you considered talking to your HR department about this? If the carpooling is causing you significant distress, they might be able to help facilitate a solution. They could also provide guidance on how to address the issue with your coworker in a professional manner."
5. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I'd say it's worth trying to find a compromise. Maybe you could take turns driving, but also set aside some time each day for solo driving or listening to music/podcasts. This way, you're still getting the benefits of carpooling, but also getting some time to yourself. You could also try to find other common interests or hobbies to bond over, which might help make the daily commute more enjoyable."

TITLE: Can I refuse to sign an amendment to my Employer contract which was not pre-agreed? (Location: UK - Wales)

POST: What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?

Background:
My employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.

My problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. 

I calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as £530. I only earn £1,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.

Can I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?

My issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).

I think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary. New job would be a  £4,500 pay increase; walking distance so less fuel costs; less travel time etc.

TL;DR: Can I refuse to sign an amendment to my employment contract which was not pre-agreed? I've had a job offer and an interview lined up, but I'm worried about the financial implications of this change.

---

**Legal Advice:**

The poster is correct that they did not agree to the amendment to their contract and that it may be unfair to impose such a significant change without their consent. However, the poster should be aware that refusing to sign the document may have consequences for their employment.

In the UK, employment contracts can be amended by agreement between the employer and employee, or by a court order. The employer may argue that the amendment is a reasonable and necessary change to the contract, and that the employee's refusal to sign may be a breach of contract.

The poster should consider the following options:

1. Negotiate with the employer: The poster may be able to negotiate with the employer to modify the amendment or to provide a different arrangement for repaying the costs. This could include a payment plan or a waiver of the repayment obligation.
2. Seek legal advice: The poster may want to seek legal advice to understand their rights and options. A lawyer can help the poster understand the implications of refusing to sign the document and can provide guidance on how to proceed.
3. Consider resigning: If the poster is unable to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with the employer, they may need to consider resigning from their job. This could be a difficult decision, but it may be necessary if the poster is unable to accept the terms of the amended contract.

In terms of the interview, the poster should be aware that refusing to sign the document may not necessarily affect their chances of getting the job. However, it may be seen as a sign of unwillingness to adapt to changes or to work with the employer. The poster should carefully consider their decision and weigh the potential consequences before making a decision.

**Additional Information:**

* The poster should check their employment contract to see if there is a provision for amending the contract. If there is, it may specify the procedures for making changes to the contract.
* The poster should also check if there are any relevant employment laws or regulations that may affect their situation. For example, the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides protection for employees against unfair dismissal, and the Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination in the workplace.
* The poster may want to consider seeking advice from a trade union or employee representative organization. These organizations may be able to provide guidance and support in negotiating with the employer.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my ex [19F] of 2 years, when we decided to break up for the semester, we said we'd talk during the winter break, but...

POST: My ex girlfriend and I dated for 2 years and broke up at the beginning of September, we ended in good terms and stayed in touch throughout the semester. When we broke up though she said she didn't want us to stop talking, and we'd talk about us in the Winter break... 

Here comes the winter break, and 2 weeks later we've hung out twice. Once with all of our friends, and once just the two of us (we didn't talk about us just had lunch and caught up. It went well and i even noticed she's still wearing a ring i gave her on our 2 year anniversary). 

Now though, I asked her if we could talk yesterday and she didn't respond at all and it's almost like she's avoiding talking about it. Today, she wasn't in a good mood when i texted her to see if we can meet and talk about us. Caught off guard, i told her if she didn't want to talk about it right now, i'd back off. She responded with "That would be nice." 

I'm just confused with what's going on. It seemed like we were going to get back together, as she was still wearing the ring, and well I may just be blinded because i want her back. But now I'm just unsure, confused and a little hurt. I'm going to back off as i said i would, and contact her again in weeks to come.

TL;DR: Ex and I broke up 2 months ago, we said we'd talk during winter break, but now she's avoiding me and I'm unsure what's going on. She's still wearing the ring I gave her and I'm hurt and confused.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're reading way too much into the ring. She's probably just holding onto sentimental value or something. Don't get your hopes up too high."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. You're clearly still invested in this relationship and she's not. It's okay to acknowledge that and move on."
* "Maybe she's just not ready to talk about it yet? Give her some space and don't pressure her. You can always reach out again in a few weeks."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about what's going on. Ask her straight up if she's still interested in getting back together or if she's just using you as a friend. You deserve to know the truth."
* "I'm with OP, I think she's still got feelings for him. She's just being cautious or unsure. I'd give her some space and see how things go."
* "OP, you're not blind, you're just hopeful. It's okay to want her back, but don't get your heart broken again. Take care of yourself and focus on your own healing."
* "I think you should take a break from her and focus on yourself. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and if she's not willing to work on the relationship, then maybe it's time to move on."

TITLE: I [20 M] can't help being jealous of my best friend [20 M] and it's hurting our relationship

POST: My best friend from high school, let's call him Harry, is really successful. Like, ridiculously so. Self-made multi-millionaire at 20 after starting his own business at 18 while also graduating from university 2 years early. We were rivals in a bunch of things at school, and it wasn't a problem, but had a big fight when I was rejected from my first-choice university after Harry also applied and got in with a very similar resume, even though he had no intention of going. We made up, and later he offered me a chance to join him in starting his business (part-time while studying), but I declined.

In hindsight, I think that not putting enough effort into university applications and not being willing to commit to the work associated with a start-up are two of the worst decisions I've made. I'm fairly high-achieving by most standards: have ended up at a top university anyway, getting good grades, currently working a well-paid internship, etc. Of course it's difficult not to be comparative, but by itself the fact that I'm jealous of Harry is something I think I can deal with. What's making it really problematic that his successes are closely correlated with my own biggest regrets. Since we're living in different countries right now, it takes some effort to Skype and stay in contact; but because of those associations and the emotional response I get when thinking about them, I'm increasingly hesitant to do so (he talks about his academic and corporate work a fair bit, since they're very big parts of his life right now), and have to focus on pushing down those feelings when we're talking. Of course this is my problem not his, and I'm not sure it's the sort of thing I'd want to discuss with him, but I'm wondering how people would recommend dealing with this.

TL;DR: I'm jealous of my best friend's success, which is closely tied to my own biggest regrets. It's making it hard for me to stay in touch with him and I'm not sure how to deal with these feelings.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a platform for people to share their personal struggles and receive advice and support from others.

TITLE: Protecting my brand - question

POST: I'm starting a business (only local and online at first, no brick and mortar) and at first this will only be selling apparel. 

I have a name of the business, a name of the apparel line, and a logo. I've check trademarks and everything is fine - do I need to trademark the name before I sell anything? 

The trademark (I believe has to be done separate since the names are slightly different between company name and apparel line name) is expensive I think (700 up front maybe?) - didn't know without doing that if I had any protection if someone stole my name and or logo.

TL;DR: Do I need to trademark my business name and apparel line name before selling anything? Is there any protection for my brand without doing so?

---

**Response 1:**

Hi there!

Congratulations on starting your business! It's great that you're thinking ahead and considering trademark protection.

In the US, you don't necessarily need to trademark your business name or apparel line name before selling anything. However, it's highly recommended to do so, especially if you plan to expand nationally or internationally.

The cost of trademark registration can vary depending on the complexity of the application and the jurisdiction. In the US, the cost for a basic trademark application is around $225-$325. However, if you need to respond to any office actions or oppositions, the cost can increase.

As for protection without trademark registration, you do have some limited protection under common law. For example, you can claim common law trademark rights in your business name and logo, which can give you some protection against competitors who might try to use similar marks.

However, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area where you're doing business, and they can be difficult to enforce. Registered trademarks, on the other hand, provide nationwide protection and are easier to enforce.

If you're concerned about someone stealing your brand, you might consider taking some additional steps to protect yourself. For example, you could:

* Register your business name and apparel line name as domain names
* Use a trademark search tool to see if anyone else is using similar marks
* Consider registering your logo as a design patent
* Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to differentiate yourself from competitors

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Response 2:**

Hey there!

I'm not a lawyer, but I can try to help you out.

From what I understand, you're asking if you need to trademark your business name and apparel line name before selling anything. The answer is no, you don't necessarily need to trademark them. However, it's highly recommended to do so, especially if you plan to expand your business.

Trademark registration provides legal protection for your brand, which can help prevent others from using similar marks. Without registration, you may have limited protection under common law, but it's not as strong as registered trademark protection.

As for the cost, it's true that trademark registration can be expensive. However, it's an investment in your brand and can help protect your business in the long run.

* Register your business name and apparel line name as domain names
* Use a trademark search tool to see if anyone else is using similar marks
* Consider registering your logo as a design patent
* Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to differentiate yourself from competitors

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my Ex-Fiancee[27 F] 5 years, how long until it doesn't matter?

POST: Fairly new Redditor here, and a private person so posting something like this should show the level of lost I'm at...also sorry if format is wonky. 

Anyway, had a relationship with an awesome girl starting Jr year of college and extending through 3 years after graduation. A little bickering but no big fights and we got along really well 95% of the time. We had moved in together, both had stable jobs and were engaged to be married in 7 months time. (Had been engaged about a year at this point.)

One night she wakes me up 1-2 AM and simply says "I'm done." No clue or hints leading up to it, just two words, goes downstairs to sleep on the couch, and has packed essentials for a move to parents house while I am at work the next day. In 6 months she's married a new guy but claims all that happened "after us." Come to find out her parents resented me for... reasons (honestly never clear on the what or why) and basically had been telling her to do better for a few years. YEARS! 

So...it's two years later and I'm with a wonderful girl for almost a year now. Problem is I go into these funks where all I can think about is what I lost, what could I do different, etc. This sounds bad but probably 2-3 times a month I wake up and my first waking thought is crippling disappointment that she's not there next to me. I am 100% committed with my current girl, but deep deep down I don't know how I would feel if relationship prospects with the ex weren't 100% killed. How long (or how do I) get back to "normal"? Any advice on ways to stop dreaming/imagining about the life we were planning?

Thank you fellow Redditors.

TL;DR: Ex-fiancee left me 2 years ago, I'm with someone new now, but still have lingering feelings and thoughts about what could've been. How long until it doesn't matter?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. It's completely normal to still have feelings and thoughts about the past, especially when it was a significant relationship like an engagement. It's not about forgetting or moving on, but about acknowledging the pain and moving forward. It's great that you're committed to your current partner, but it's also okay to take time to process your emotions. You might consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend about your feelings. It might also help to focus on the present and future with your new partner, rather than dwelling on the past.
2. **SarcasticSally**: OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but it sounds like your ex was a total psycho. I mean, who just up and leaves their partner without any warning or explanation? And then has the nerve to claim that everything happened "after us"? Girl, bye. You're better off without her. As for your feelings, it's normal to still have some lingering emotions, but try to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship. You're with someone new, and that's a great thing! Don't let your ex's drama dictate your happiness.
3. **RelationshipRookie**: OP, I can totally relate to feeling like you're stuck in the past. It's like, you're trying to move on, but your brain is still stuck on the what-ifs. For me, it helped to create a new routine and focus on the present. Try doing something new, like taking up a hobby or trying a new restaurant. It might also help to have an open and honest conversation with your current partner about your feelings. They might be able to offer some insight or support. And hey, it's okay to acknowledge the pain of the past, but don't let it define your future.
4. **HeartbrokenHank**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. It sounds like you were blindsided by your ex's decision to leave. I know it's hard to believe, but it's not about you. It's about her and her own issues. You deserve someone who loves and respects you for who you are. It's great that you're with someone new, and I hope you can focus on building a healthy and happy relationship with them. Remember, it's okay to take time to heal, but don't let the past dictate your future. You got this!
5. **ExperiencedEx**: OP, I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it takes time to heal. It's not something you can rush or force. Just be patient with yourself, and focus on the present. You're with someone new, and that's a great thing! Try to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship, and don't dwell on the past. Remember, you're not the same person you were when you were with your ex. You've grown and changed, and that's a beautiful thing. Keep moving forward, and don't look back. You got this!

TITLE: Have lost all my motivation to go to work

POST: I recently switched jobs (5 months) from a larger institution to a smaller company. Over the last month I have gotten very disillusioned with my new job, I miss the camaraderie of my old job as well as the lower level of stress. Also the old job was much closer to my house.

For me the most important thing is not my job, I don't have the ambition to be in a super high paying job, I like having an average job if it means I have the energy and motivation to do that and extracurriculars.

I recently applied to a different job posting at my old company. I feel totally unmotivated to go to work and I've called in "sick" about 3-4 times the last month....

I guess what I'm asking is; how do I stay motivated to keep going to work right now, at least until I get another job, and should I just go back to my old boss and ask him for my old job back (as opposed to trying for this new position). He mentioned I could do that because he likes me.

TL;DR: Lost motivation for new job, miss old job, applied to old job back, feeling unmotivated to go to work, should I just go back to old boss and ask for old job back?

TITLE: I [20 M] went on a date but was it really a date?

POST: So first a little bit of backstory to put things into context: I recently started university and got along well with a girl. I subsequently asked her out for dinner to which she accepted. It wasn't explicitly mentioned that it was a date but I guess I assumed it was implied which probably was a bad idea. The "date" went extremely well and I did have a wonderful time with her and although I really do like her, I get the impression it's one sided.

During the date, I told her that I considered this a date and whatnot and well I feel like I've put my foot in my mouth. How do I now tell her that I don't really care what happens and I would rather keep her as a friend than be awkward around each other?

TL;DR: Went on a date with a girl, told her it was a date, now I'm worried it wasn't and I don't know how to tell her I don't want anything romantic.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you gotta be honest with her. Just tell her how you're feeling and that you value your friendship with her. Don't beat around the bush or try to sugarcoat it. She might be feeling the same way and it's better to clear the air now than to let things drag on."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about it. Ask her how she felt about the date and what she thought it was. If she says it was just a friendly dinner, then you can have a conversation about where you both stand. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
3. **u/skeptical_sam**: "Honestly, if you told her it was a date and she didn't correct you, then it's probably a date. You can't just assume it's not a date because you're not feeling the same way. You need to respect her feelings and boundaries. Maybe you should try to get to know her better and see if there's a connection there."
4. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I think you should just be honest with her and tell her how you're feeling. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to lead her on or pretend like you're interested when you're not. Remember, it's okay to say no to someone and it's okay to be honest about your feelings."
5. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "Hey there! I'm a bot designed to provide relationship advice. It sounds like you're in a bit of a pickle. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with the girl about your feelings. Let her know that you enjoyed spending time with her, but you don't feel the same way romantically. Be respectful and kind, and try to maintain a positive friendship if that's what you both want."

TITLE: [HELP] My girlfriend's dog isn't trained, and she refuses to let me train him...

POST: Her dog has been with her since it was 8 weeks old. He is always at her side and she spoils him.

He also has the bad habit of begging for food when we are eating because she gives him food from her plate. She believes dogs in nature just expect humans to share food with them and she is completely okay with letting him lick the plates and bowls clean "if he didn't beg". Which just means if he lays by her feet and stares at her, she will eventually give him food. How can I break this behavior?

He also doesn't use his dog bed to sleep in, instead he humps it. And she allows him to hump it. He humps sheets, pillows, anything and she doesn't scold him at all. I'm afraid to get a cat because he might start humping it.

Upon the front door opening he makes a break for it. He doesn't wait, doesn't hesitate. And just runs for it, which makes me afraid I might come home from work and he will run out and I'd have to chase him down.

He also barks randomly at random times even after being let out or played with. It's quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and he is barking up a storm and scratching the bed I'm sleeping on.

He sleeps on top of the couch and I try to make sure he stays off the furniture but according to her " thats just what he does"

If he is on my bed or the couch he will also start trying to dig and I dont like him doing that to my sheets because he's a dog with nails and I don't want my sheets or couch ripped.

Every time I try to bring these issues up to her she tells me it's her dog, not to yell at him, don't push him down when he's jumping on things, etc.

How do I fix this situation? Or am I overreacting?

TL;DR: My girlfriend's dog has some bad habits and she refuses to let me train him. He begs for food, humps things, runs out the door, barks randomly, and digs on the furniture. I'm at a loss for what to do.

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're being a bit too harsh on your girlfriend. It's her dog, and she's the one who's been taking care of him since he was a puppy. Maybe try having a calm and respectful conversation with her about your concerns instead of just listing off all the things you don't like about the dog."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's not about being 'overreacting', it's about being respectful of your girlfriend's boundaries and her relationship with her dog. Maybe try focusing on the positive aspects of the dog's behavior and see if you can find some common ground with your girlfriend."
* "I think you should try to understand where your girlfriend is coming from. She's probably attached to the dog and doesn't want to change his behavior because it's a part of their bond. Maybe try to find ways to compromise, like setting boundaries for the dog's behavior in certain situations, but still allowing him to have some freedom and autonomy."
* "I'm a dog trainer and I think you should try to work with your girlfriend to train the dog. It's not about 'fixing' the dog, it's about teaching him new behaviors and reinforcing good habits. You could start by setting up a training session with a professional trainer and then work with your girlfriend to implement the training at home."
* "I think you should consider having a conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns, but also be prepared to listen to her perspective and compromise. It's not about 'winning' an argument, it's about finding a solution that works for both of you and the dog."

POST: A bit of background on her: seventeen, in high school (as well as myself). Straight-A student, probably going Ivy League. Quiet around most people, loud and hyperactive around me. Likes to read. Popular, but I've noticed she seems to crave attention a lot -- she's a self-described 'camwhore' with a 'god complex', and I've seen her do various 4chan tinychats with thirty or forty guys, even though she was [doxed] once. I don't ever say anything about it, as it's her business. She was also homeschooled as a kid -- didn't go to public school until age fourteen.

She has panic attacks and cuts typically when her parents tell her she's doing something wrong, whether it's minor or not. She says she 'doesn't like to think [she] does things wrong, just different' and she 'wants them to know she cares.' I know she cuts because she sent me a picture. I deleted it, even though I know now I really shouldn't have.

I also know I have to tell someone, but I don't know who. Her parents wouldn't believe me, and she's convinced that cutting is the only way to release pain, so she won't get herself help. Can I help her? If so, whom should I go to? I'm not sure the school counselors are of any use -- I've been through this a few times with different people and different issues, and they're very negligent in these sorts of matters.

TL;DR: Best friend self-harms, I know she cuts, and I don't know who to tell. I'm scared to tell her parents, and I don't think school counselors would help. Can I help her? Who should I go to?

COMMENTS:

* "You're doing the right thing by being concerned about your friend. It's not your responsibility to 'fix' her, but you can definitely help her get the help she needs. You should talk to a trusted teacher or school administrator, and let them know what's going on. They can help you get her the support she needs."
* "I'm not a professional, but I think you should talk to a school counselor. They may not be perfect, but they're trained to handle situations like this. You can also talk to a trusted teacher or administrator, like the school psychologist or the principal. They can help you figure out what to do next."
* "I'm a mental health professional, and I would recommend that you talk to a trusted teacher or school administrator about your concerns. They can help you get your friend the support she needs, and they may be able to connect her with a therapist or counselor who can help her work through her issues. It's important to remember that self-harm is a sign of deeper emotional pain, and it's not something that can be 'fixed' overnight. But with the right support and treatment, your friend can learn to manage her emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms."

TITLE: The (shortened, not-so-detailed) story of me [16M] and my ex [15F]

POST: Four things before I start: 1. I'll be using faux names, me as Jack, her as Kit. 2. It was short, but wonderfully amazing. 3. I am a junior, her a freshman. 4. She is bisexual
So, me and Kit met at band camp, and quickly became friends, mostly because we both play clarinet. Apparently, she really liked me from the start. I liked her as well. Jump ahead about a month, and you find me and Kit at an after-game party. She soon asks "Hey Jack? Would you like to be my boyfriend?". And I reply "who wouldn't, Kit?". Soon, we are cuddling on a nearby bench.

Jump ahead about 2 weeks, and you'll find Kit slowly unzipping my pants(we are both needy on the sexual side). Soon enough, I get a good sucking. And a little later, she gets a good show of my finger tricks. Again, jump ahead a week or so, and you join us in an adventure:
"Hey, Jack?"
"Yeah?"
"Where's the quietest place we can go?"
"Follow me, my lovely Kit"
I lead her to the guest bedroom. She hops on the bed, and tells me to undo my pants. I do so, and then she follows. As I lean her back, I mention how sexy she is. It gets sweaty in that room for a few moments.

Skip ahead, again, 2 weeks, and you'll find me sucking her breasts. Again(for the laat time), skip ahead a few weeks, and you'll find us hardly talking to each other.

I'm gonna need help to get over this, guys.
We are friends, as in we still contact each other, and, plot twist, she would like to go to prom with me

TL;DR: Me and my ex-girlfriend, Kit, had a short but amazing relationship. We had some great times, but it ended. I'm having trouble getting over her, and I'm looking for advice on how to move on.

---

This post is a great example of a relationship story that is both intimate and relatable.

TITLE: Found out my (28F) best friend (29F) of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post. At a loss for words.

POST: First, the goods news. She is no longer living with cancer!

This morning when I woke up and for some reason grabbed my phone and checked Facebook immediately. I rarely do this. This first post I see is from my best friend announcing that today is a good day because she is cancer free. I was in shock because I didn't even know she had cancer!

Clearly she has her reasons for not sharing this information with me, but I feel like an absolutely terrible friend that she felt she could not tell me. Furthermore, I have known a lot of people to get cancer in the past 7 years, and I always would tell her "so and so has cancer and I'm really sad, hoping she/he will get better soon" and if I'd known she also had cancer I wouldn't have brought it up so much!

A bit of background on our friendship and why I feel I've been an insufficient friend to her:
We met in elementary school and were bffs. During my second year of high school, I had to move so we stopped seeing each other as much. We still hung out when we could and she was always my best friend. At the end of high school I started dating a guy who turned out to be abusive. We were together for 5 years, and throughout that time period he slowly isolated me from my friends and family, and said mean things about the people closest to me. (Things like my parents didn't really love me and other fucked up things.)

Anyway, I got out of that relationship, so i started hanging out with her more again. It was a relief to me that she didn't completely hate me for my time spent being distant. For the past five years we've lived in different cities, but we still see each other once in a while and write letters to each other. (We've always sent each other snail mail)

I'm currently working on a reply to one of her letters, but I don't know how to approach this topic, since I found out through social media and not a personal message. I already feel terrible that I haven't even sent her a text.

TL;DR: Best friend of 20 years had cancer for 7 years and I found out through a Facebook post. I feel terrible for not knowing and not being there for her. How do I approach this conversation with her?

---

TITLE: Managers and/or military personnel; please help. What do you do when someone you're in charge of just won't listen to you or do his work?

POST: I'm in a leadership position in ROTC and we are in charge of drilling and marching cadets. I have a slacker who just won't pay attention or listen to rules. He is always half-assing everything, and in turn other cadets follow his influence. My colonel is chewing my ass because I'm responsible for him. 

Nothing I do phases him; he's the kind that was forced by parents into ROTC, and he's the kind of person who never follows rules and does drugs and has attitude problems. 

I try being nice to him, but that doesn't work. I gradually became stricter and stricter, even issuing push ups, and he flat out gave attitude to me and refused to do them.

Help?

TL;DR: I'm a ROTC leader and I have a slacker cadet who won't listen or follow rules. He's causing problems for the rest of the team and my colonel is on my case. What do I do?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Have you considered having a one-on-one conversation with him? Sometimes people respond better to a personal approach rather than a strict, authoritarian one. Try to find out what's driving his behavior and see if you can address the root cause. Also, have you considered setting clear expectations and consequences for not following rules? Make sure he knows what's expected of him and what will happen if he doesn't meet those expectations."
2. **u/Former_Military_Person**: "I was in a similar situation in the military. What worked for me was to take away his privileges. If he's not doing his job, then he shouldn't get to participate in the fun stuff. Take away his duties, make him do extra push-ups, or make him stay after practice. Sometimes, people respond to consequences more than they do to positive reinforcement. Also, make sure you're documenting everything, so you can show your colonel that you're taking steps to address the issue."
3. **u/Manager_Mike**: "I've had similar issues with employees who just won't listen. What I do is try to find out what's motivating him. Is he trying to get attention? Is he bored? Is he trying to prove a point? Once I understand what's driving his behavior, I can start to address it. I also make sure to set clear expectations and consequences, and I follow through on those consequences. If he's not meeting expectations, then he needs to know what's going to happen. Finally, I try to find ways to make the task more engaging or challenging for him. Sometimes, people just need a little motivation to get them going."

**Other comments:**

* "Have you considered talking to his parents? Sometimes, parents can be a great resource in helping to motivate their child."
* "I would try to find a way to make the task more enjoyable for him. Maybe he's just bored with the same old routine."
* "I would take away his leadership role and give it to someone else. Sometimes, people respond better when they're not in a position of authority."
* "I would have a meeting with the whole team and explain the expectations. Sometimes, people respond better when they know what's expected of them."
* "I would try to find a way to make the task more challenging for him. Maybe he's just not being challenged enough."
* "I would try to find a way to make the task more meaningful for him. Maybe he's just not seeing the point of what he's doing."

TITLE: Me[18M] I think I want to end a serious relationship, need advice. Her[16MF]

POST: I have been dating this girl on, and off, for over 5 years, some may say it's probably not serious, but it is. But my ex [18F] has recently re-kindled a strong passion I had for her for a while, about 6 months. I want to give it another shot, but I don't know how to cut the ties with the relationship I am in. I really love my current girlfriend, but I want to give my ex another shot, and I have no idea what to do. My current girlfriend is very attached to me, and I don't want to lose her, so I need real advice.

TL;DR: I'm 18, been dating my girlfriend for 5 years, but I've reconnected with my ex and I want to give it another shot. I love my current girlfriend, but I don't know how to end the relationship without hurting her.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456** (1,200 karma): "Dude, you're 18, you're still figuring out who you are, and you're already in a 5-year relationship? That's a lot of pressure. You need to take some time to reflect on what you really want. Do you really want to be with your ex, or are you just caught up in the excitement of a new possibility? Take a step back, and think about what you're doing. You don't have to make a decision right now. Just be honest with yourself."
2. **u/relationship_advisor** (800 karma): "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, ending a serious relationship is never easy. But if you're truly considering it, you need to have an honest conversation with your girlfriend. Don't lead her on or string her along. Be respectful, and be prepared for the consequences. Remember, you can't control how she reacts, but you can control how you approach the situation. Take responsibility for your actions, and be prepared to face the fallout."
3. **u/just_a_random_user** (500 karma): "I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I will say this: you need to think about what you're doing. You're 18, and you're already in a 5-year relationship. That's a lot of commitment. Are you sure you're ready for that? And are you sure you're ready to give up on your current relationship for someone else? Take some time to think about what you really want, and don't rush into anything. You're young, and you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't make a decision that you might regret later on."
4. **u/relationship_expert** (300 karma): "I'm not going to give you advice on what to do, but I will say this: you need to be honest with yourself. Are you really in love with your ex, or are you just caught up in the excitement of a new possibility? Take some time to reflect on your feelings, and don't rush into anything. Remember, you can't control how your girlfriend reacts, but you can control how you approach the situation. Be respectful, and be prepared for the consequences. And most importantly, be honest with yourself."

TITLE: Me [23M] - cannot handle my friends [same age, M/F] hanging out with my parents

POST: Hi - kind of a weird question / situation. I'll try to be brief.

I am from country A, did high-school in country B, and am currently in the United States for college. My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.

The problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. 

I cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.

I remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.

So, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.

It's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.

TL;DR: I'm 23, my friends from country A are visiting country B, and I'm really struggling with the thought of them hanging out with my parents without me. It's making me anxious and I don't know how to deal with it.

**Comments:**

1. OP, you're not alone in this feeling! I had a similar experience when my friends from college came to visit my hometown and my parents took them out for dinner without me. It's weird, but it's like you're feeling left out even though you're the one who suggested it. Maybe talk to your therapist about this and see if they can help you work through it.
2. I think it's great that your parents are being so welcoming and friendly to your friends! Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation and the fact that your friends are having a good time with your parents. It's not like they're trying to replace you or anything.
3. OP, I think you're being a bit too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel a little left out or anxious in situations like this, but it's not like you're being replaced or anything. Your friends are just having a good time with your parents, and that's okay. Maybe try to relax and enjoy the fact that your friends are having a good time with your family.
4. I think you should talk to your parents about how you're feeling. They might not realize that you're feeling this way, and they might be able to help you work through it. Maybe they can even take you out for dinner or something with your friends, so you can all spend time together.
5. OP, I think you're being a bit too sensitive about this. Your friends are just visiting your hometown, and your parents are being friendly and welcoming. It's not like they're trying to replace you or anything. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation and the fact that your friends are having a good time with your family. It's not a big deal, really.

**OP's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I think I was being a bit too hard on myself, and I appreciate your perspectives. I'll definitely talk to my therapist about this and see if they can help me work through it. And yeah, maybe I should try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation and the fact that my friends are having a good time with my family. Thanks again for your help and support!

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] of almost 3 years, suggested taking a break?

POST: A large group of our friends are going to this weekend camping festival and due to the size of it and how we are all arriving on different days it is unlikely that I am sharing a tent with my girlfriend.

She recently suggested that we "took a break" for the festival. At first I was shocked and didn't know if it was because she didn't want to spend time with me, had stopped liking me and even wanting to go out getting with other boys.

I obviously said no and asked why she wanted that and she just said she trusted me however didn't trust my friends and thinks they would egg me on to get with other girls and fool around a bit.

I'm really confused about the whole situation, she says she was "testing me" to see if I would want to take a break however that feels like she doesn't trust me. Also I feel like maybe she doesn't like me as much as I thought seeing as she suggested we break up so I can fool around..

I'm really confused about this whole situation and just want some outsiders' opinions to sort of guide me through it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend suggested taking a break for a weekend camping festival, saying she trusts me but doesn't trust my friends. I'm confused and feel like she doesn't trust me or like me as much as I thought.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's trying to test your boundaries and see if you'll cheat on her. It's not a good sign if she's already assuming you'll do that. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you feel."
* "I think she's trying to create a sense of distance between you two, maybe to re-evaluate the relationship or to give herself permission to explore other options. You should talk to her about what's really going on and see if you can work through this together."
* "It's possible that she's just feeling overwhelmed or stressed and needs some space. But if she's saying she trusts you but doesn't trust your friends, that's a red flag. You should be honest with her about how you feel and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I think you should take a step back and evaluate the relationship. If she's already suggesting you take a break and potentially cheat on her, that's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve better than that."
* "Have you considered that she might be feeling insecure or jealous? Maybe she's worried that you'll meet someone else and she's trying to create a sense of distance to protect herself. You should try to have a calm and rational conversation with her about what's going on and see if you can work through it together."

**OP's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments, it's really helped me clear my head and see things from a different perspective. I think you're all right, she's probably trying to test my boundaries and see if I'll cheat on her. I'm going to have an open and honest conversation with her about how I feel and see if we can work through this together. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I feel like I'm being tested or judged all the time. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: [20M] I may have just lost a friend [20F].

POST: A little backstory from a post about a month ago 

So here is what's going on now. About a week ago, she took a break from her boyfriend. She came to my house and we fooled around for about 6 hours. It was amazing, but I feel like a horrible person for doing it. She says she loves me more than anything and wishes we were together, but she's too afraid to leave the position she's in now because it's "too risky". Now she's done with her break and she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I love her so much, I just don't know what to do anymore. I told her that it would be difficult being friends because at the end of the day, she'll be going home to her boyfriend and that's going to break my heart. Sorry guys, I feel like a total bitch looking for advice because I usually stray from this kind of drama that I somehow got sucked into. I just don't know what to do anymore. I guess I'm just hoping that thing don't work out for them, and that makes me feel incredibly selfish. Anyways, thanks for anything.

TL;DR: I had a one-night stand with a friend who's in a relationship, and now she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I'm torn between being happy for her and being hurt that she's choosing him over me.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling torn. Here's my two cents: you need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. If you're not comfortable being friends with her, that's okay. You can't force yourself to be friends with someone who's choosing someone else over you. Take some time to reflect on what you want and what's best for you. Remember, you deserve to be happy and respected in your relationships.
2. **u/relationship_guru**: OP, I've seen this situation play out many times before. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for people to prioritize their current relationship over a potential new one, even if they have strong feelings for the other person. It's not selfish to want to be with someone who loves you back, but it's also important to respect your friend's decision. You can't control how she feels or what she chooses to do. Instead, focus on taking care of yourself and moving forward. You never know what the future holds, and you might find someone who is more compatible with you.
3. **u/honesty_is_the_best_policy**: OP, I'm going to be blunt: you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. You're not just hurt because she's choosing her boyfriend over you; you're also hurt because you know you're not the one she's choosing. You deserve someone who will choose you over everyone else. Don't settle for being the "friend" who's always on the sidelines. You deserve better. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. You might be surprised at how much better you feel when you're not constantly wondering what could have been.
4. **u/compassionate_counselor**: OP, I want to acknowledge that this situation is incredibly difficult for you. It's normal to feel confused, hurt, and uncertain about what to do. Here's a suggestion: try to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Be clear and direct about your emotions, but also be respectful of her decision. You might not get the outcome you want, but having a genuine conversation can help you both process your feelings and move forward. Remember, you deserve to be heard and respected in your relationships. Take care of yourself during this challenging time.

TITLE: [21 M] My friend won't hang out with me because she is on makeup break? [23 F]

POST: She is a cosmetologist. She wears a HEAVY amount of makeup. All the time. Recently she started breaking out in acne, that is what she told me. She told me she cried for an hour because of it and she has never had a break out this bad before. So she is on a "Makeup Break" I asked her how long and she said a week.

I asked to hang out and she said she couldn't because of makeup break. I told her I didn't care if she didn't wear makeup, she said that I would care. I don't know, our friendship is just platonic right now,

So now I feel kind of hurt and weird. Is this even normal? For a girl to not see her friends without wearing make up first? What am I supposed to say? I'm kind of upset actually, I feel played with.

TL;DR: My friend is a cosmetologist and is on a "makeup break" due to acne. She won't hang out with me because she doesn't want to be seen without makeup. I feel hurt and played with.

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's a bit dramatic to say you're on a'makeup break' because of acne. It's not like she's going through chemo or something. If she's really struggling with her self-esteem, maybe have a conversation with her about it. But if she's just being flaky, then yeah, it's a bit weird."
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. It's not like she's saying you're not good enough to hang out with her without makeup. It's just that she's going through a tough time and needs some time to focus on herself. Maybe try to understand where she's coming from instead of getting defensive."
* "I've been in a similar situation before and I can tell you that it's not just about the makeup. It's about feeling confident and comfortable in your own skin. If she's struggling with acne, it's understandable that she wouldn't want to be seen without makeup. Maybe try to be more understanding and supportive instead of getting upset."
* "I think you should just be honest with her and tell her how you're feeling. If she's really struggling with her self-esteem, she might appreciate your support and understanding. But if she's just being flaky, then yeah, it's a bit weird."
* "I think it's a bit of both. She's probably struggling with her self-esteem and acne, but she's also being a bit flaky. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about it and see where she's coming from. But also, don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs."

This post highlights the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication and understanding. The OP is feeling hurt and played with because their friend is not willing to hang out with them without makeup, which they perceive as a superficial reason. However, the comments suggest that there may be more to the story, such as the friend's struggles with self-esteem and acne, which could be affecting their confidence and willingness to be seen without makeup.

The post also raises questions about the importance of makeup in our society and how it can affect our self-esteem and relationships. Some people may view makeup as a way to enhance their appearance and boost their confidence, while others may see it as a necessary part of their daily routine. In this case, the friend's decision to take a "makeup break" may be a way for her to focus on her own self-care and well-being, rather than a superficial reason to avoid social interactions.

Ultimately, the post highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in relationships, and the need to communicate openly and honestly with each other. By doing so, we can build stronger and more meaningful connections with others, and work through challenges and conflicts in a healthy and constructive way.

TITLE: My boyfriend [23/m] is a picky eater and I'm [23/f] sick of it.

POST: My boyfriend is a horrendously picky eater, both when we cook at home (most of the week) and when we go out (once or twice a week). He'll eat only white chicken meat, steak, pizza, spaghetti or a hamburger. Green beans are the only veggie he'll touch, and he has to be vigorously persuaded to eat any fruits, after which he expects to be praised as if he's done something wonderful.

I'm an adventurous eater, and I work out hard during the day so that I can enjoy something I like for dinner. I love sushi, curries, gyro, pho, ramen, etc etc. Boyfriend won't even try any of these, for a plethora of excuses.

I'm fine if he contains his picky eating to himself, but I'm sick of always going to his restaurants because I can find something I'll tolerate on their menus, and he won't go near any of mine. I want to be able to cook more adventurously at home (usual menu is chicken breast, rice or potatoes, green beans- BORING) without him whining and just eating a muffin or frozen pizza instead. I'm worried about his health and I resent not being able to do something I enjoy.

In the past, we've had very nonconstructive conversations about this. He got defensive, I got snarky. I need a way to reframe the issue, maybe some scripting help or practical compromises. Any ideas?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is super picky eater, I'm sick of it. Want to cook more adventurously at home, but he won't try new foods. Need help reframing the issue and finding compromises.

**Comments:**

1. "I'm an adventurous eater too and I can totally relate. Have you tried having a conversation about it when you're both relaxed and not hungry? Maybe frame it as 'I love trying new foods, can we find some compromises?' instead of 'you're so picky'? Also, have you considered cooking separate meals? It might not be the most ideal solution, but it could be a temporary fix until he's more open to trying new things."
2. "I think it's great that you're concerned about his health, but maybe try not to make it about that? Instead, focus on how it affects your relationship and your own desires. You could say something like 'Hey, I love cooking for us, but it's getting a bit boring for me. Would you be open to trying some new recipes or restaurants with me?'"
3. "I'm a picky eater too, and I can understand why your boyfriend might be hesitant to try new things. Have you tried asking him what he's afraid of? Is it the texture, the taste, the smell? Maybe there's a specific reason he's not willing to try new foods. Also, maybe you could compromise by cooking one adventurous dish and one'safe' dish, so he feels more comfortable trying something new."
4. "I think it's great that you're willing to compromise and find a solution. Maybe you could try cooking one meal a week that's a bit more adventurous, and then have a'safe' meal the rest of the week? That way, you're still getting to cook something new and exciting, but he's not feeling overwhelmed. Also, maybe you could try involving him in the cooking process more? Sometimes people are more willing to try new foods if they had a hand in preparing them."
5. "I think it's important to remember that everyone has their own preferences when it comes to food. Maybe instead of trying to change your boyfriend's eating habits, you could focus on finding common ground? Are there any foods that you both enjoy? Maybe you could plan meals around those foods and compromise on the rest. Also, maybe you could try having a 'foodie date' where you both go out to try new restaurants and foods together? That way, you're both getting to experience new things and having fun together."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Reframe the conversation to focus on the impact on the relationship and personal desires rather than criticism or blame.
* Consider cooking separate meals or finding compromises that allow for both adventurous and safe options.
* Ask your partner about their fears or concerns about trying new foods and try to understand their perspective.
* Involve your partner in the cooking process to make them more invested in trying new foods.
* Focus on finding common ground and planning meals around foods you both enjoy.
* Consider having a "foodie date" to explore new restaurants and foods together.

TITLE: G/F refuses to move away from the city ever

POST: My current g/f (she is 24) of 5 years and I (am 28 turn 29 in Jan) are living together. She works in the financial business at a call center and I work at a engineering company designing and building plants. I am a recent grad and got a job here in the town she grew up in and where we both went to college. We have been talking and I told her at some point I will prob wind up in the field or will move to a job site for awhile to gain experience to advance. She straight up said if your career means that much to you then go. She refuses to leave our area b/c of family. I then asked what if I go to field and come home every other weekend or every weekend if it is close enough (a bunch of people do that in our office) and she said no, she doesn't do long distance relationships. She called me selfish and I should want to be with her. I tried to explain at some point I will need to go to advance my career and I cant work at the same job and the same area my entire life and her response was just find another job in the area. She responded we can't just get married and buy/build a house and just turn around and sell it, that it makes no sense we might as just rent. I am not looking to move nor do I want to really atm. If I do I want to come back to the area eventually. I just feel if the opportunity for a better job or good experience was come along in a different area i should be able to take it or at least discuss the options at the time and have the ability to maybe take it but she is basically say no now. I know it is kind of hard to play the what if game but feel this is something we would talk about before we think of marriage which i have been thinking about.

TL;DR: G/F refuses to move away from her hometown for career opportunities, calls me selfish for considering it, and says we should just rent instead of buying/building a house. I feel like we should be able to discuss and consider options for my career advancement.

---

This post is a great example of a common issue in relationships: conflicting priorities and values. The OP (original poster) is looking to advance his career, which may require moving to a different location, while his girlfriend is unwilling to leave her hometown and family. The OP feels that his girlfriend is being unreasonable and selfish, while his girlfriend sees him as prioritizing his career over their relationship.

The post highlights the importance of open and honest communication in relationships. The OP and his girlfriend need to have a more nuanced conversation about their priorities and values, and find a compromise that works for both of them. The OP may need to understand his girlfriend's concerns and feelings about leaving her hometown, while his girlfriend may need to understand the importance of career advancement for the OP.

The post also raises questions about the importance of compromise and flexibility in relationships. Can the OP and his girlfriend find a compromise that allows him to advance his career while still being together? Or will their differing priorities and values ultimately lead to a breakup? The post is a great example of the challenges that couples face when trying to balance their individual goals and aspirations with their relationship.

TITLE: I [27F] told my younger sister [18F] to break up with her toxic boyfriend [19M]. My parents are now mad at me for "breaking up the family."

POST: I could tell from the start my sister's new boyfriend was a toxic individual. I wanted to tell her to break up with him, but I was scared to do so. I built up the courage to tell her after 3 months. She was just in a fight with him, and I told her to break up with him because he was a toxic person, and she was just starting to realize that. The next day, she broke up with him.

When she told our parents that she broke up with him and I had really helped her, our mom was *furious.* She went off on me and yelled at me for about 10 minutes because I had "broken up the family" and that her boyfriend had been a perfectly nice person and was not toxic. Our father was on her side, but my 4 siblings (including the sister mentioned) were on my side. They said they had realized he was a toxic person, but hadn't spoken up.

Now, I don't know what to do about my parents. They're threatening to go no contact with me because I'm an embarrassment to the family. Do you have any advice for me, Reddit?

TL;DR: I told my 18-year-old sister to break up with her toxic boyfriend. My parents are now mad at me for "breaking up the family" and are threatening to go no contact with me. I'm unsure of what to do.

**Reddit's Response:**

* **Many users are praising OP for taking a stand and protecting her sister:** "You did the right thing, OP. It's not your fault your parents are being unreasonable. You're a good sister and a good person." "I'm so proud of you for standing up for your sister and doing what's best for her. Your parents are just mad because they're invested in their own relationship and don't care about your sister's well-being."
* **Some users are offering advice on how to handle the situation:** "Try to have a calm and rational conversation with your parents. Explain to them why you did what you did and how it was for the best. If they're still not listening, it might be time to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being." "Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can help you navigate this difficult situation and provide you with coping strategies."
* **A few users are sharing their own experiences with toxic relationships:** "I was in a toxic relationship for years, and it took a lot of courage for someone to finally tell me to get out. You did the right thing, OP. Your sister is lucky to have you in her life." "I know how hard it is to recognize the signs of a toxic relationship. You're a great sister for recognizing the signs and taking action. Your sister will thank you for it in the long run."

**OP's Follow-up Post:**

* **OP updates that she had a conversation with her parents and it didn't go well:** "I tried to have a calm and rational conversation with my parents, but it didn't go well. They're still convinced that their son-in-law is a great guy and that I'm just being dramatic. They're still threatening to go no contact with me. I'm feeling really hurt and frustrated right now."
* **OP asks for further advice:** "What do I do now? I feel like I've done everything I can to try to reason with them, but they're just not listening. Do I just have to accept that we're going to have a strained relationship for a while? Any advice would be appreciated."

TITLE: 25[m] Need advice on dipping in family biz ink.

POST: For the record i've always been against doing this for obvious reasons.

Anyways- there's an employee at my Family business  that i've had my eye on for some time. I don't work there but I come in on a regular basis.

I want to ask her out but never do because:

*2. I can't find an opportune private moment that won't make it fucking awkward for her and potentially embarass her (and me)

TITLE: Why do some people have a harder time asking for help?

POST: I've noticed that some people have a harder time asking for help than others. It seems like some people are more willing to admit when they don't know something or need assistance, while others are more likely to struggle with asking for help.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I've come up with a few possible explanations. One possibility is that some people are more confident in their abilities and are less likely to feel like they need help. Another possibility is that some people are more introverted and are less comfortable with the idea of asking for help.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think there are other factors that contribute to people's willingness to ask for help?

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 1.5. Today, my girlfriend is modeling for the first time. How do I remain supportive without letting my jealousy ruin our relationship?

POST: A bit of background on myself: I am a photographer by trade.  Somewhat as a joke, my girlfriend has always playfully been very against my taking photos of her.  It hurt and annoyed me at first when she played coy, but eventually I just stopped trying to involve her in my work.   

She is a very attractive girl - to the point of being openly approached constantly whenever she's out at no matter the setting (work, etc).  That said, she grew into her good looks and somewhat enjoys the attention she gets now.  Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup she is a fan of.  Excited with the idea, she agreed.

At the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.  The photographer inside me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her.  The boy in me is jealous that she is so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me (taking photos) initially.  I'm also just not that comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online - perhaps a bit possessive/insecure, but I just don't love the idea of her half naked all over the internet and lastly... The boyfriend in me is being supportive and pushing her to do something she wants to even though I really feel bad about it.  

I don't want to push her away and I want to see her happy.  How do I deal with my own insecurities and jealousy with this situation.  She's at the shoot right now and having a great time.  I'm at home in knots.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is modeling for a clothing company for the first time. I'm a photographer and I'm struggling with jealousy, insecurity, and possessiveness. How do I remain supportive without letting my feelings ruin our relationship?

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: navigating one's own emotions and insecurities while supporting a partner's goals and desires. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and possessiveness due to his girlfriend's decision to model for a clothing company.

The post highlights the importance of self-reflection and communication in relationships. The OP needs to acknowledge and address his own emotions and insecurities in order to support his girlfriend's decision without letting his feelings ruin their relationship.

Some possible ways the OP could deal with his emotions and remain supportive include:

1. Acknowledging and accepting his feelings: The OP needs to recognize and accept his emotions, rather than trying to suppress or deny them. This can help him to better understand and manage his feelings.
2. Communicating with his girlfriend: The OP should have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns. This can help to clear the air and ensure that they are both on the same page.
3. Focusing on his girlfriend's goals and desires: The OP should try to focus on his girlfriend's goals and desires, rather than his own feelings and insecurities. This can help him to be more supportive and understanding of her decision.
4. Finding ways to cope with his emotions: The OP may need to find healthy ways to cope with his emotions, such as exercise, meditation, or talking to a therapist. This can help him to manage his feelings and reduce stress.

Overall, the key to navigating this situation is to be honest with oneself and one's partner, and to prioritize communication and understanding. By doing so, the OP can remain supportive of his girlfriend's decision while also addressing his own emotions and insecurities.

TITLE: Me [18 M] and my girlfriend [16 F] are going to sleep together for the first time. I'm anxious.

POST: I'm a very anxious person in general, sometimes to an obsessive degree.

We've been together for over two years without having sex. At first she was too young (14) and now she wants a time when she is free of stress so she can be relaxed and not have to worry about anything else. The.. event itself will take place in about a month, after she finishes her exams. We've considered it now and then through the time we've been together but always decides to wait.

Now it isn't being put off any longer. And, while it has been a TORTUROUS wait for me (worth it, to be with someone like her), it suddenly seems... rather sudden and immediate. 

God knows I want to, and I definitely don't want to wait any longer, but at the same time I don't know how I'm going to be fully ready by the time it happens. 

I understand on an intellectual level that it is not that big a deal. Just sex, right? But emotionally it seems like a great deal more than that.

And I know that it is for her. We're very open in discussing these matters. To her this is a really big deal; her virginity is something she can only ever give to one person and she wants it to be meaningful. It's sharing a more intimate part of herself than she ever has before.

I understand and even agree with her. But that kind of adds pressure to the situation. I don't want to screw up and make her first time something she doesn't want to remember. And I don't know if worrying about it will just make it more likely to happen.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking here. As much a chance to just talk about it as possible,I guess; my only confidante aside from my girlfriend is asexual, and as such she can't give much input here. But do I really have anything to worry about? Just how badly CAN I screw this up? And is there anything I definitely, definitely shouldn't do?

TL;DR: I'm 18, my 16-year-old girlfriend and I are going to sleep together for the first time. I'm anxious and worried about making it special for her. What can I do to make it a good experience for her?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's just sex, and it's not like you're going to ruin her life or anything. Just relax and enjoy the moment. You're both adults, and you've been together for a while, so I'm sure you'll figure it out."
* "I understand your concerns, but you need to remember that this is a big deal for her too. It's not just about sex, it's about sharing a special moment with someone you care about. Just be respectful, communicate with her, and make sure you're both on the same page. And honestly, if you're still feeling anxious, maybe you should take a step back and have a conversation with her about it."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. It's just sex, and it's not like you're going to be the first person to ever have sex. Just relax, be yourself, and enjoy the moment. And if you're still feeling anxious, maybe you should talk to a therapist or something."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on making it special for her. Remember that this is a big deal for you too. It's okay to be nervous, and it's okay to take your time. Just make sure you're communicating with her and making sure you're both comfortable with what's happening. And honestly, if you're still feeling overwhelmed, maybe you should consider waiting a bit longer."
* "I think you're being way too anxious about this. It's just sex, and it's not like you're going to be the only person to ever have sex. Just relax, be yourself, and enjoy the moment. And if you're still feeling anxious, maybe you should talk to a therapist or something."

Overall, the comments are trying to reassure the OP that it's just sex and that he should relax and enjoy the moment. Some comments also suggest that he should communicate with his girlfriend and make sure they're both on the same page. However, there are also some comments that suggest he should take a step back and re-evaluate his feelings about the situation. The comments are generally supportive and encouraging, but also offer some words of caution and advice.

TITLE: I [21F] have deep feelings for my friend[23 M]. How to get over them and is it possible to still be friends?

POST: I met him in October last year at university. We immediately clicked and since we have the same major, we took the same classes. I think he liked me at first, he would text me all the time and ask me to hang out on weekends. He is a very nice guy and I really enjoyed his company and looked forward to getting his texts everyday.

At the beginning of this quarter, things started to change. He started texting me less and no longer asked me how my day was and that's when I realized that I have feelings for him, and it shocked me how intense they were. I was thinking about him 24/7 and it affected me in a negative way. I no longer wanted to hang out with anyone, I got bad grades in all my classes and I just slept all the time. The texting almost stopped right now. I still see at school everyday and we spend our breaks together, he's nice when I'm with him and still teases me and jokes around.

Right now, I don't know what to do and I'm not sure what he's thinking, I sometimes wonder if he just doesn't want spend our break time with me but is too nice to say so and I wonder if I pushed him away when I was having a hard time controlling my feelings when I'm around him by being cold and ignoring him. I want to stop thinking about him and move on. I really want to focus on school and get good grades since is not too late.
Distancing myself from him is not an option at this point since we are taking the same classes. Also, I can never be in a relationship with him because of some circumstances. How do I stop being so miserable all the time? How do I stop waiting for his texts when I know he won't be sending me anything? Is it possible to get over him and still be friends? He hasn't done anything wrong and it doesn't feel right to be mean to him. Please help me!!

TL;DR: I have deep feelings for my friend, but it's not possible for us to be in a relationship. I want to stop thinking about him and move on, but I don't know how. I still need to take classes with him and I don't want to be mean to him. How can I stop being miserable and still be friends?

**Top comments:**

* "It's great that you recognize your feelings and are willing to work on moving on. It's not easy, but it's possible. Try to focus on your schoolwork and other hobbies to take your mind off him. It might also help to talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings and get their perspective."

TITLE: My roommate has told me many disgusting band camp stories and so I'm curious: What are YOUR most horrifying stories from band and/or camp?

POST: The main story that stuck with me involved my roommate and this guy that everyone in the band absolutely hated. For the life of me, I can't remember his name, so I'll call him "Dave". Dave apparently was an asshole to everyone and if there's anything to take away from this story, it's to not piss off band geeks.

My roommate's high school band was traveling by bus to a school in a different city for a competition. Dave had been messing with the people in band all week and as a band member himself, would be accompanying them to the competition. The bus ride was going to take around 4-5 hours and a group of trombone guys (including my roommate) decided it would be a great opportunity to get back at Dave. They sneaked into the band room, opened Dave's trombone case, and stole his mouthpiece.

One by one, the guys took turns jacking off into it. One of the them stuck it up his ass. Another pissed on it.

They made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May. For 5 hours, that mouthpiece sat roasting in shit and piss and semen like a fetish-loving prostitute in the trunk of a car. When the bus finally stopped, Dave took it out and played his trombone as if not a single thing was wrong.

TL;DR: Roommate's band camp story about stealing a band member's mouthpiece, jacking off into it, and pissing on it, then leaving it in the storage section of the bus for 5 hours.

COMMENTS:

* "I'm not sure what's more disturbing, the fact that they did it or that they didn't rinse it out"
* "I'm a band geek and I'm still trying to wrap my head around this"
* "I'm not sure if I should be impressed by the creativity or horrified by the sheer disgustingness of it all"
* "I'm just going to assume that the bus driver was oblivious to the whole thing and just thought it was a weird smell"
* "I'm not sure if I should be more concerned about the health risks or the sheer audacity of the prank"
* "I'm just going to assume that Dave never washed his trombone again and it's still sitting in his case to this day"
* "I'm not sure if I should be more disturbed by the fact that they did it or that they thought it was a good idea"
* "I'm just going to assume that the bus driver was a band geek too and was in on it the whole time"

This post has received over 1,000 comments, with many users sharing their own disgusting and disturbing stories from band camp. The post has also been upvoted over 10,000 times, indicating that many users find the story to be both shocking and entertaining. The comments range from disbelief and horror to amusement and admiration for the creativity of the prank. The post has also sparked a discussion about the boundaries of what is considered acceptable behavior in a band setting, and whether the prank was justified or not. Overall, the post has become a popular and memorable story on the r/AskReddit subreddit.

TITLE: My thoughts on my own Christmas this year - am I doing the right thing?

POST: Firstly - sorry for the 'downer' on a day like today - just really on my mind.

Well Reddit, another year has come around and its Christmas - I work in retail so I'm surrounded by people that are talking about doing everything with the family and friends, buying presents for everyone, so on and so fourth.

With my career, and it being my own choice, I sometimes have to move to different places to manage stores, its still a yes/no choice but to move up its something that I have to do and shouldn't really say NO to, as its something that is somewhat required of you (see of it as, what are you willing to give up to get a chance of a life time) - although I'm starting to think just how much of my own life am I giving up to chase my dreams?

I don't live with my family anymore, and I'm roughly 1200km from them (not much, I know, but we are talking about $600 in flights, possibly more for return) - my girlfriend is now even further away, and shits getting pretty tough there too with the distance and not being able to be there for each other.

I left most of my friends, and rarely hear from them now (could be partly my fault not speaking to them either, but frankly I'm pretty busy most of the time and we just end up drifting apart).

So reddit, without giving you the entire life story, I ask for your guidance:

My job could potentially give me (X) amount of money to live comfortably for the rest of my life, filling a dream that I fill I would love to achieve - but in the process losing the closeness of friends, family and loved ones - but possibly getting them back in the end?

Or do I get out now, move back to family and loved ones (in an area possibly without as good job prospects and in some ways settle for'second best' or have to work even harder to get where I want to be?

If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them - I mean, I don't have anything to do today on Christmas, right? I'm alone and self reflecting!

TL;DR: I'm a retail manager, I'm 1200km away from family and friends, I'm considering a job that could give me financial security but would mean losing the people I love. Should I take the job and potentially get them back in the end, or should I leave and settle for'second best'?

TITLE: Me [30 M] with my wife [27 F] of several months, and a tax disagreement?

POST: I'll do my best to keep this concise.

My wife has a chronic illness. As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.

Our state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.

The trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer. Long story short, she's going to lie on her taxes and file as "Single" and obviously I have to as well. 

I am incredibly uncomfortable with lying on my taxes but both she and her mom (who was, to be fair, a tax attorney) think it should be okay for one year. I would imagine most people wouldn't lie to say they were *single* on their taxes, so I guess there's that.

I don't see a realistic way for us to afford coverage through my employer, unfortunately. I'd love for this to be a "put my foot down" moment but if that results in her losing coverage I don't think I can justify it.

We all have to make sacrifices in marriage... is this a reasonable one for me to make? I guess worst-case scenario is we get caught and busted for a large fine. Which puts us back on square one (or square 0.5, due to the fines...)

TL;DR: Wife has chronic illness, needs health insurance, we can't afford it through employer, we'd have to lie on taxes to get subsidies. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to lie on taxes?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being reasonable for not wanting to lie on your taxes. It's not worth the risk of getting caught and facing fines. Have you considered talking to a tax professional to see if there are any other options for your wife to get coverage?"
* "I understand your concerns, but lying on your taxes is not the answer. Have you considered looking into other health insurance options, such as a short-term plan or a catastrophic plan? These plans may not be as comprehensive as a major medical plan, but they can provide some level of coverage."
* "I think you're being unreasonable for not wanting to lie on your taxes. Your wife's health is at stake here, and if lying on your taxes is what it takes to get her the coverage she needs, then I think it's worth the risk. You can't put a price on your wife's health."
* "I understand your concerns, but I think you're being too focused on the moral aspect of lying on your taxes. The reality is that your wife needs health insurance, and if lying on your taxes is what it takes to get it, then I think it's worth considering. You can always make it up to your wife by being more honest in other areas of your life."
* "I think you're being reasonable for not wanting to lie on your taxes. It's not worth the risk of getting caught and facing fines. Have you considered talking to a financial advisor to see if there are any other options for your wife to get coverage? Maybe there are other ways to make it work that don't involve lying on your taxes."

TITLE: I [F24] am not looking for a relationship, but am infatuated with my coworker [M26]

POST: I [F24] moved overseas for work about 18 months ago, breaking up with my boyfriend of 5 years to do so. I'm convinced the break up was the right thing to do, but it's hit us both very hard and I don't feel ready to move on yet.

When I started working at my new job, I immediately noticed that one of my coworkers, Mark [M26] was pretty cute, but didn't give it much more thought. The two of us are the youngest members of our team by a significant margin. We happen to come from the same country, he's been here for about 3 years. There aren't many young single women in my industry, so for the first few months I was swamped with suitors, but Mark (as is proper for a coworker) never showed any sign of interest.

About 6 months ago my team moved offices, and I had to start sharing an office with Mark. Naturally we started to casually chat more once we were crammed in the same 12 square yards for 9 hours a day, and I've slowly started to develop an irrational infatuation with him. I get unjustifiably upset if he calls in sick for the day, or even just shows up a little late in the mornings. He's perfectly friendly with me, but has never shown any sign of wanting to have any social interaction outside of a work context (I do meet with other coworkers outside of work sometimes). He's straight but been single the whole time I've been working here.

This infatuation is stupid, I'm not ready to start dating again, I know that coworkers are totally a no-go zone, he's shown no interest in me, and I don't actually think we'd even be particularly compatible. I haven't let my infatuation get in the way of my work, if anything I'm working longer hours because he tends to leave later than I would otherwise. I know I have to get over him, but I just don't know how to go about it since rationally I don't want to look for or get into any kind of non-platonic relationship with any guy right now. Advice, please!

TL;DR: I'm not looking for a relationship, but I've developed an irrational infatuation with my coworker. I know it's a no-go zone, but I don't know how to get over him since we're stuck working together. Help!

TITLE: I'm great at small talk, but how do I move past that?

POST: Reddit, I'm great on first and second dates when a lot of it is asking questions and getting to know about the other person. In fact, I love meeting new people because I'm pretty decent at small talk. After the first or second date though, I seem to run into a wall about what to talk about. 

Is this a problem of just 'chemistry' (fuck, how does it work)? I'm great hanging out with friends and with girls that are in that damned friend zone. I just can't seem to make it work on a one-on-one setting with a girl I'm interested in, in a date situation. I'm just wondering if anyone had any tips out there. Thanks!

(Note: I have been in relationships before (21 years old), but I feel that this seems to be part of the reason why they don't go anywhere and just kind of fizzle out.)

TL;DR: I'm great at small talk, but struggle to move past that on dates. Any tips on how to build a deeper connection with someone?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and be yourself.

People are more likely to connect with someone who is genuine and authentic."
2. **u/throwaway321**: "I think you're focusing too much on the 'date' aspect and not enough on getting to know the person.

Just be present and enjoy the moment."

TITLE: Put a deposit for a Kitten way back, found out I'm allergic to Cats. Advice?

POST: Okay I believed that I was not allergic to anything after being told by my parents and everyone in my family that I do not have allergies and had tests done.

I put down a deposit for a Ragdoll Kitten, $350 for something not even born yet.
Now I just found out I'm allergic to Cat Dander. 

I don't know what to do. I want to get a refund but I'm first gonna ask you guys and do research. Should I get a Ragdoll even if I am allergic? I've heard all stuff about them being great cats for people with allergies and I heard the exact opposite as well. I know Cat Dander comes from saliva. 

I fell in love with Ragdoll Cats so this is just difficult for me to come to terms with. 

I just need extra insight and advice.

TL;DR: Put down deposit for Ragdoll Kitten, found out I'm allergic to Cat Dander, unsure what to do.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/CatLady99**: "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Ragdolls are indeed known for being hypoallergenic, but it's not a guarantee. You should definitely reach out to the breeder and explain your situation. They might be willing to work with you or offer a refund. Don't give up hope just yet!"
2. **u/FelineFrenzy**: "I'm allergic to cats too, and I can tell you that Ragdolls are NOT hypoallergenic. They shed a lot, and their saliva can still trigger allergies. You should consider getting a different breed that's known to be hypoallergenic, like a Sphynx or a Devon Rex. They're still adorable, and they won't make you sneeze!"
3. **u/PurrfectlyPawsome**: "I'm a Ragdoll owner, and I can attest that they're amazing cats! However, I do have allergies, and I've learned to manage them with HEPA filters, regular cleaning, and medicated shampoos. If you're still set on getting a Ragdoll, you could try these methods to reduce your exposure to cat dander. But if you're really allergic, it might be better to consider a different breed."
4. **u/CatDanderSucks**: "Ugh, I feel your pain! I'm allergic to cat dander too, and it's so frustrating. You should definitely get a refund and consider a different breed. There are plenty of adorable, hypoallergenic cats out there. Don't settle for a cat that's going to make you miserable. Good luck, and I hope you find a cat that's perfect for you!"
5. **u/KittenLady**: "I'm a breeder, and I've had customers with allergies before. We've worked together to find a solution, and some have even kept their cats despite their allergies. If you're still interested in getting a Ragdoll, I'd be happy to discuss options with you. Just remember to prioritize your health and well-being. You deserve to have a happy, healthy life with your new furry friend!"

TITLE: Difficult situation. I (m29) am in love with one of my best friends (f28).

POST: Here's my situation:

I am in love with my good friend and coworker. We've both worked at the same ad agency in NYC for several years and over that time have developed a really solid friendship. We often talk, half-jokingly, about how we should travel together. Now there is a chance that our company might send us both abroad to work on a project together. I know she also really values our friendship, but I can't tell if her feelings go any deeper than that, like mine do.

Things are a little complicated by the fact that as long as I've known her she's had a long-term boyfriend, except for a short period last year when they took a "break".  It's also complicated because we're all part of the same friend group so I often have to see them together, which is usually torture for me. I'm not exactly buddies with her bf, but we have many friends in common. 

So, what do I do?  Do I just tell her how I feel and risk alienating myself from our group and possibly losing her as a friend (while still having to work with her)?  Do I wait and hope that things eventually fizzle out for good with her bf? Or do I just accept that I might never be with her and try to enjoy the strong friendship we have.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL;DR: I'm in love with my best friend and coworker, but she's in a long-term relationship. I'm torn between telling her how I feel and risking our friendship, or waiting and hoping things don't work out with her bf. Help! 

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's great that you're considering the potential consequences of your actions. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new crush, but it's important to think about how your actions might affect others. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your friend about your feelings? It's possible that she might feel the same way, or that she might be open to exploring something new. But it's also possible that she might not feel the same way, and you need to be prepared for that possibility too."
* "I think you should wait and see how things play out with her bf. If they're still together in a year, it might be worth having a conversation with her about your feelings. But if they're not, it might be worth taking a chance and seeing if there's a possibility of something more between you two."
* "I think you should just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, then you can still maintain a strong friendship and move on. But if she does feel the same way, then you can explore the possibility of something more together."
* "I think you should consider the potential consequences of your actions on your friend group. If you tell her how you feel and she doesn't feel the same way, it could create tension and awkwardness in the group. You need to think about whether it's worth risking your relationships with your other friends for the possibility of something more with this one person."
* "I think you should take a step back and focus on yourself for a while. You're clearly feeling a strong emotional connection with your friend, but you need to make sure that you're not getting caught up in the excitement of the moment and ignoring your own feelings and needs. Take some time to reflect on what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship, and then see if you can have a conversation with your friend about your feelings in a way that is respectful and considerate of her own feelings and needs." 

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful and honest responses! I really appreciate the advice and perspectives. I think I'm going to take a step back and focus on myself for a bit, like one of you suggested. I need to make sure I'm not getting caught up in the excitement of the moment and ignoring my own feelings and needs. I'll also try to have an open and honest conversation with my friend about my feelings, but I'll do it in a way that is respectful and considerate of her own feelings and needs.

TITLE: My 12 year old brother recently confessed that he was molested by his doctor. My mother does not want to press charges because she doesn't want to put him through any more trauma; I think it is better to deal with it now. Reddit, how can I convince my mom to press charges against this doctor?

POST: Throwaway acct.

6 months ago, my younger brother explained to my mom that he found the doctor that he had his sports physical with "creepy" and that he didn't want to go back to him again.  He explained that the doctor had touched him for a long time, but my mom thought that it was just his reaction to having his first physical without her in the room.  6 months later, after learning of similar charges being brought against the doctor by others, my mom talked to him and he confessed that he knew what the doctor had done was wrong, and that it had really scared him.  I won't go into any details, but what he described was indisputably molestation.  My mom is afraid to press charges because she doesn't want him to have to describe the situation any more than he already has.  Personally, I think that not dealing with this now is going to really fuck him up down the road.  Reddit, do you side with my mom, or me on this?  If there are any professional lawyers, psychologists, etc that have dealt with this, what is the right decision right now?

TL;DR: My 12 year old brother was molested by his doctor, and my mom doesn't want to press charges because she doesn't want him to relive the experience. I think it's better to deal with it now, but I'm not sure what the right decision is.

This post is a prime example of the complexities and challenges that can arise when dealing with cases of child sexual abuse. The author's mother is understandably concerned about the potential trauma that her son may experience if the case goes to court, but the author believes that not pursuing charges now will have long-term negative consequences for their brother.

The post raises important questions about the balance between protecting the child from further trauma and ensuring that the perpetrator is held accountable for their actions. It also highlights the need for a nuanced and sensitive approach to these cases, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of each individual involved.

The responses to this post are varied and thought-provoking, with some users siding with the mother's concerns about the potential trauma, while others argue that pursuing charges is necessary to hold the perpetrator accountable and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Some users also offer practical advice and resources for navigating the legal and therapeutic systems.

Overall, this post highlights the importance of a comprehensive and compassionate approach to addressing child sexual abuse, one that prioritizes the well-being and safety of the child while also holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.

TITLE: How do you deal with people who are trying to have a life competition with you?

POST: I am in college, and am a photographer, I had this girl last year who I became friends with because we were both into photography, she asked me many questions, tips, advice all that stuff because I had been doing it longer and I was completely ready to share everything with her, while not really gaining anything in return accept a kind of satisfaction from someone wanting my help.  

She now constantly talks down to me, not just about photography but about everything, and literally just treats me like shit unless it suits her to do otherwise (basically never) I have a hard time being a bitch, and I always end up just being nice when I want to stand up for myself.  She has literally shoved everything about her life that I don't have in my face her family/friends/home/money/boyfriend (she has rich parents/family who have bought her every piece of equipment she has and paid her way through school, this only bothers me because I have worked very hard for what little I have, and she always whines about money, while I often am broke and rarely bring up financial problems)  

She is also (after having done photography for only 6 months) getting paid work, I have yet to have this, and it really is sheer luck but the very first "collaboration" we did together she had a model and invited me along (all fine) I said "hey I know this awesome spot, and I have all this paint, and here is some awesome stuff we could do!" then she posted all her photos before I did and didnt mention me so everyone thinks I copied her, and it has worked that way for many things to follow and I am just wondering how you people deal with being enraged at someone who you cannot avoid, also I think if I blatantly stop talking to her the rest of the people around us will think I am the one being a bitch, which also bothers me, what do I do?

TL;DR: I'm a photographer in college, I was friends with a girl who asked for my help and advice, but now she constantly talks down to me and treats me like shit. She has a rich family and gets paid work, while I'm still struggling. I'm angry and frustrated, but I don't want to be the one who comes across as mean or bitter. How do I deal with this situation?

**Top comments:**

1. "I would suggest setting boundaries with her. Let her know that you're not comfortable with her constant belittling and that you'd like to maintain a professional relationship. If she continues to treat you poorly, it might be time to re-evaluate the friendship."
2. "I think you're being too nice. You don't have to be friends with someone who treats you poorly. If you can't avoid her, then just be polite and distant. You don't owe her anything, and you shouldn't feel guilty for not wanting to be around someone who makes you feel bad about yourself."
3. "Have you considered talking to her about how her behavior is affecting you? Sometimes people don't realize the impact they're having on others, and a calm and respectful conversation can go a long way in clearing the air. Just make sure to approach the conversation in a non-accusatory way and focus on your own feelings and experiences."
4. "I would suggest finding a new group of friends who appreciate you for who you are. You don't need to surround yourself with people who make you feel bad about yourself. Focus on building relationships with people who support and uplift you."
5. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You don't have to be friends with someone who treats you poorly, and you shouldn't feel guilty for not wanting to be around someone who makes you feel bad about yourself. You deserve better than that. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being."

**Subreddit community response:**

The Reddit community is overwhelmingly supportive and understanding of the OP's situation. Many users share their own experiences of dealing with toxic people and offer advice on how to set boundaries, prioritize self-care, and focus on building positive relationships. The community also emphasizes the importance of not internalizing the negative behavior of others and not feeling guilty for taking care of oneself. Overall, the response is one of empathy and encouragement, with many users offering words of support and solidarity.

TITLE: My girlfriend[18/F] of 1 month, told me[19/M] that she doesn't believe in love, but I do!

POST: So I've known this girl for about 3 months. She blew me away from the minute I first met her in my friends house. We hung out a lot (4/5 nights a week) over summer, just as friends. I asked her out about 1+1/2 months ago and things are going good!

But there's one thing that has been bugging me. She openly admitted to me about 2 months ago that she doesn't believe in love. She said she thought she was in love in a previous relationship, but now realizes she wasn't at all.

This is bugging me because I know I'm very capable of loving another person. I'm worried that if I grow to love her after a while, she won't feel the same.

Is this an opinion that a lot of people have about love? Do you think I can change her opinion? Or do you think I'm wasting my time and I'm asking for my heart to be broken?

.. I'd rather clear this in my mind while I'm still in the early stages..

TL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't believe in love, but I do. I'm worried about the future and if she'll ever feel the same way. Should I be worried?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for people to have different beliefs about love. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it's definitely something to consider. If you're really invested in this relationship, you could have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Maybe she'll surprise you and have a different perspective on love than she initially let on."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think it's great that you're thinking critically about this relationship. It's always better to have these conversations early on rather than later down the line. You could ask her what she means by 'not believing in love' and see if she's open to exploring the idea of love with you. If she's not, then it might be worth considering whether this relationship is sustainable for you."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being a bit too invested in this already. You've only been dating for a month, and you're already worried about the future? Take things slow and get to know her better before you start worrying about whether she believes in love or not. It's not like she's said she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you or anything."
4. **u/love_is_a_choice**: "I think it's great that you're thinking about this! Love is a choice, and it's not something that just happens to you. If you're willing to choose to love her, then maybe she'll be open to it too. Just remember that you can't force someone to feel a certain way, so don't put too much pressure on her. Just enjoy the ride and see where things go!"
5. **u/relationship_expert**: "I think you're overthinking this. Love is a complex emotion, and it's not something that can be forced or manipulated. If you're genuinely happy with your girlfriend and you feel like you have a connection with her, then that's all that matters. Don't worry too much about whether she believes in love or not. Just focus on building a strong and healthy relationship with her."

POST: *Not sure if this belongs here, but /r/relationships does not allow general questions, so....help me out please!*

I've been dating my SO (34M) for about a month so I don't need to worry overly much about this right away, but I like to be prepared. I'm looking for the time frames that you experienced with landmarks in your relationships, to give me a ballpark. Examples include:

- When did you exchange keys?
- When did you first say "I love you"?
- When did you start to feel like your respective homes were a place you could "feel at home", i.e. you would do dishes or help with chores even though the place wasn't your own?
- When did you start farting around each other?

Things like that. What do you consider landmarks? When did they happen?

We spend most of our time at my place for convenience and he seems to fit in to my home nicely. He is comfortable making breakfast or doing dishes and has offered to help with other chores if I happen to need to do them when he's over. So far I've turned down his offer to help with other chores, but I do appreciate the gesture.

I have a history of moving in too soon, so I know I need to wait QUITE a while before I ever even consider that move. Like, over a year. At least. I just don't know how the rest of it should/could play out. I do expect some widely varied answers, so any details as to why you think it was good timing/later than normal/sooner than normal would be much appreciated.

We started farting around each other almost immediately. What a relief!

TL;DR: I'm looking for general guidelines on the time frames for landmarks in relationships, such as exchanging keys, saying "I love you", feeling at home, etc. I want to know when these things typically happen and why. I'm trying to avoid moving in too soon and want to know how others have handled this.

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to avoid moving in too soon! For me, exchanging keys happened around the 6-8 month mark, and saying 'I love you' was around 3-4 months in. Feeling at home took a bit longer, around 9-12 months. As for farting around each other, that's a great question! For me, that started happening around the 2-3 month mark. I think it's all about getting comfortable with each other and feeling like you can be yourself around each other."
* "I'm a bit of an outlier, but I exchanged keys with my partner after only 2 months. We were both in a rush to move in together and it worked out great for us. Saying 'I love you' was around 4 months in, and feeling at home took a bit longer, around 6-8 months. As for farting around each other, that started happening pretty quickly too, around 1-2 months in. I think it's all about the pace of your relationship and what works for you and your partner."
* "I think it's great that you're taking your time and not rushing into anything! For me, exchanging keys happened around the 1-year mark, and saying 'I love you' was around 9-12 months in. Feeling at home took a bit longer, around 1.5-2 years. As for farting around each other, that started happening around the 6-9 month mark. I think it's all about building trust and getting to know each other on a deeper level."
* "I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, but I think it's great that you're taking your time! For me, exchanging keys happened around the 2-year mark, and saying 'I love you' was around 1.5-2 years in. Feeling at home took a bit longer, around 2.5-3 years. As for farting around each other, that started happening around the 1-2 year mark. I think it's all about the journey and not rushing into anything."

**Note:** The comments are a mix of different experiences and opinions, but they all share a common thread of taking their time and not rushing into anything. The OP seems to be looking for general guidelines and is trying to avoid moving in too soon. The comments provide a range of experiences and perspectives, but ultimately, it's up to the OP to decide what works best for her and her partner.

TITLE: I love my wife [29/f] but I feel like something is missing [28/m].

POST: I have been married for about 3 years now and I absolutely love my wife. She has been the best partner I have ever had. We have had ups and downs but we always seem to work things out and we have a healthy sex life. Things are going well but I just can not seem to shake the feeling that I want more. I have lived a prim and proper, mostly conservative lifestyle up until my later years in college. I got a taste of different types of lifestyles and I have always been amazed by them. My wife was the typical break away who decided to distance herself from her family and enjoy any experience she could. There have been tales of hitchhiking with hippys and free love and all that. She has a view of people that I never had (I have been fairly cynical) and it has enabled her to meet some very interesting people from all walks of life and allowed her to make very intimate connections with these people. Well she eventually met me and she changed my outlook on the world. 

We were married right after we both graduated from college and we have taken up a fairly traditional lifestyle. She has mostly transitioned away from the past. After I had a brief chance to experience what she had experienced and after all of her stories, I was a bit jealous. I feel like our marriage has cut me off from having those intimate experiences with anyone other than her. There is a sexual aspect to this but it is also about simple intimacy. Neither of us hinder each other in the formation of new friendships but sometimes I wish we could have more. We have briefly discussed additions in the bedroom but I have never been sure if she was actually interested or if it was just her indulging me. Plus, neither of us would know where to start. I have not really discussed this with her because I don't want to hurt her and she has a way of avoiding discussions like this. 

I have maintained the status quo and told myself that those times were over. I thought I would move on from it but even several years later I can not shake the feeling that I have repressed something within myself.

TL;DR: I love my wife but I feel like something is missing. I had a taste of a more free-spirited lifestyle and now I feel like our traditional marriage is holding me back from experiencing that kind of intimacy again. I'm not sure how to bring this up with my wife without hurting her or making her uncomfortable.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're feeling a bit of FOMO (fear of missing out) because you had a taste of something different and now you're wondering what could have been. It's normal to feel this way, especially when you're in a long-term relationship. Have you considered talking to your wife about it in a non-judgmental way? Maybe she's feeling the same way and you can explore new experiences together. Just remember to prioritize your relationship and communication is key."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "OP, it sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck in a rut. I get it, we all need a little excitement and adventure in our lives. But before you start looking elsewhere, have you tried talking to your wife about your feelings? It's possible that she's feeling the same way and you can work together to find ways to spice things up in your relationship. Remember, relationships are about growth and evolution, not stagnation. Try to approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to her perspective."
3. **FreeSpirit88**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough to reconcile the desire for freedom and adventure with the comfort and security of a long-term relationship. But here's the thing: you don't have to choose between the two. You can have your cake and eat it too. Talk to your wife about your feelings and see if you can find ways to incorporate some of the things you're missing into your relationship. It might be as simple as taking a weekend trip or trying a new hobby together. The key is to communicate and be open to compromise."
4. **ConcernedFriend**: "OP, I'm a bit concerned about your feelings. It sounds like you're feeling a bit restless and unsatisfied in your relationship. Before you start looking elsewhere, I want to encourage you to take a step back and reflect on why you're feeling this way. Is it really about the freedom and adventure, or is it something deeper? Are you feeling unfulfilled in your relationship or is there something missing in your life? I think it's important to get to the root of the issue before making any big changes. And remember, relationships are about growth and evolution, not about seeking external validation or excitement."

TITLE: Me [23/f] have been seeing someone [26/M] for a couple months and not sure how to move forward.

POST: I've been talking to someone for about two months now, maybe less. I'm not the best at dating and what not, such as knowing what happens. Especially online dating. We have met already and have hung out multiple times as well as gone on a date or two. Our hang outs have been dinner, movies, and other random stuff, but we've only really been on one or two dates. The other times were with other people, so it wasn't really one-on-one. I've slept over his place a couple times, but have only had sex once. We used to talk every day, but more recently it has been every other day or every couple days. Which is fine, we have busy lives. He especially has a very busy life. 

However, I'm not sure how dating really goes. I'm not really sure what he wants, nor am I sure how to bring it up in a conversation. I deactivated my dating profile a few weeks ago because I came back to over 100 messages one day and there was no one I was really into. Also, I was a bit hung up on this guy. I recently just reactivated it, due to boredom and unsure if this guy was into me, and I've noticed he's online almost every night. I'm very much into him, but not sure if he feels the same. I'm not sure when in the "talking" stage, I bring this up. It seems like he is into me and I sort of had a conversation with him the other night where he said he wasn't interested in a booty call. 

Am I overthinking it or should I just let it happen and see where it takes me? Do you think I should bring it up? Do you think it's too early to think about this stuff? Give me your advice.

I'm terrible at dating.

TL;DR: I've been seeing someone for a couple months, we've hung out a few times, had sex once, and I'm not sure how to move forward. I'm not sure if he's into me or what he wants. Should I bring it up or just let it happen?

TITLE: Me [30 F] with my dad [60 M]. Useless relationship.

POST: Not sure if I posted in the right subreddit...

I've always felt like my whole life that my dad has hated me and not wanted to be a part of my life.  I can't even 
say, "hi." to him without it being weird.  I have never had a full conversation with him.  When I was younger he 
was an asshole to my mom to the point even family couldn't believe she put up with him.  Like, he's an arrogant 
dickhead.  He thinks he's fucking perfect and never makes mistakes.  He has no problem calling anyone stupid for 
any reason.  I'm 30.  I didn't live with my parents from 18 to 28.. Recently had to move back because I couldn't 
afford to live anywhere else.  It's so weird that we can't even say, "hi" but he'll gladly yell at me for random 
things.  I asked my sister recently if she felt the same way as me and she did.  I also asked my mom if he even 
wanted children.  She said he did but I don't believe her.  I just feel like what the hell did I do to make you 
hate me??  I talk to friends about this weird relationship and actually have one that has a similar one but 
everyone else doesn't.  I still even try to do nice things for him!  Hate myself for that... so I stopped. 
It's pretty pathetic, I'm trying to not even acknowledge him anymore.

TL;DR: I'm 30, moved back in with my dad after struggling financially, and I feel like he hates me and never 
wanted me.  I've never had a real conversation with him, and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him.  I 
don't know why he's like this, and it's affecting my mental health.

---

This post is an example of a relationship that is often referred to as "toxic" or "damaging." The OP (original poster) feels like their father has never wanted them and has always been distant and critical. The OP has tried to do nice things for their father, but it seems like it's never enough. The OP is struggling with feelings of self-blame and low self-esteem as a result of this relationship.

The post highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing toxic relationships, even if they are within the family. The OP's feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt are likely a result of the constant criticism and lack of validation from their father. It's essential for the OP to prioritize their own emotional well-being and consider seeking support from a therapist or trusted friends and family members.

The post also raises questions about the impact of toxic relationships on mental health. The OP's feelings of anxiety and depression are likely a result of the constant stress and uncertainty of living with a toxic family member. It's crucial for the OP to prioritize their own mental health and seek support to manage these feelings.

Overall, this post is a powerful example of the importance of recognizing and addressing toxic relationships, and the impact they can have on mental health. It's a reminder that it's never too late to seek help and prioritize one's own well-being.

TITLE: I'm leaving my boyfriend of three years because he refuses to flush the toilet and wash his hands.

POST: My boyfriend and I are best friends, and I've never had stronger feelings for another individual. Three months ago we got a place together, and I'm already regretting it.

The burping, I can handle. The farting, I can live with. But I will no longer put up with his terrible hygiene (or lack of it). I constantly feel disgusted and uncomfortable in my own home. Every time I step into the bathroom, I get to see his bodily fluids in the toilet. And he never washes his hands, even after taking a shit, unless I tell him to. Like a three-year-old child, I have to tell him to wash his fucking hands, or else I refuse to let him touch me or come near me.

I don't understand why it's so difficult to do. ~~If he really loved me, he'd want me to live in a comfortable and safe environment, right?~~ I've talked with him about it so many times that it's like he doesn't understand words (and he's not a stupid man; in fact, I'd consider him to be the most intelligent person I've met). He'll say "okay", the conversation will end, but then he'll "forget".

TL;DR: I'm leaving my boyfriend of three years because he refuses to flush the toilet and wash his hands after using the bathroom.

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you deserve so much better. I'm glad you're taking a stand for yourself and your own comfort. Don't let anyone make you feel like you're being too picky or high maintenance. You're worth it!"
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not just about the toilet habits, it's about the respect and care he has for you and your well-being. You deserve someone who prioritizes your comfort and health."
* "I'm a guy, and I have to say, I'm shocked. I would never expect someone to be so gross. You're doing the right thing by leaving. You deserve someone who takes care of themselves and their environment."
* "I'm a bit torn. On one hand, it's gross and unacceptable that he doesn't wash his hands. On the other hand, it's not like he's doing it on purpose. Maybe he's just really lazy or forgetful? Have you tried talking to him about it in a non-accusatory way? Maybe he's not aware of how it's affecting you."
* "I'm a bit of a germaphobe, and I have to say, I would be really uncomfortable living with someone who doesn't wash their hands. But at the same time, it's not just about the toilet habits. It's about the bigger picture of whether he's willing to listen to you and make changes for your sake. If he's not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."

TITLE: Me [28F] with my new friend/crush [31M] of one month, he has been showing obvious signs of interest towards me for the past month. Two days ago he told me he has a long-distance girlfriend. So confused, Reddit help!

POST: A little background about myself: I have not been in a serious relationship since I was 21 and have only dated casually since then. I am open, available and looking for a more long-term relationship.

About a month ago, I started hanging out with this guy who I've discovered to be the most caring, kind, and encouraging individual that's been in my life recently. Signs started to show early that there was some kind of attraction between us. Here are some things that have happened in the last month (some still happening):

-prolonged eye contact and lots of easy, fun conversation
-prolonged or tight hugging
-after saying goodbye, our eyes often meet once more before departure (with smiles)
-texting everyday starting in the morning and lasting into the evening
-he has said things like "you are the nicest person I have ever met", "I see you as one of the people who will always be in my life"
-while on a weekend trip with friends, he threw his arm around me while sleeping (multiple friends sharing a bed)
-he said he would treat me to dinner (which he then turned into a group thing)

A couple days ago he told me he would be gone the next week because he was going to see his girlfriend (who lives six hours drive away) and expressed that they have been having difficulties for the past six months due to the long-distance. I learned that they have been together for 3+ years. 

I love that he shows an interest in me but realistically I feel that it is unfair and that I'm being led on. I'm scared to say something because I don't want the attention to stop, but I know I am in a vulnerable position. I secretly want him to break up with his girlfriend. Reddit, any advice is welcome, please!

TL;DR: I've been hanging out with a guy for a month, showing obvious signs of interest, but he just told me he has a long-distance girlfriend. I'm confused, scared, and unsure what to do.

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's using you as a distraction from his real relationship. You deserve better than that. Don't waste your time on someone who's not willing to be honest with you."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're interested in him, but you can't continue to see him if he's not willing to be honest about his relationship status."
* "It's possible that he's genuinely struggling with his relationship and is seeking comfort and companionship elsewhere. If that's the case, it's not fair to him to lead him on or pressure him to break up with his girlfriend. You need to prioritize his feelings and well-being, as well as your own."
* "I would say that you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings for this guy. If you're feeling like you're being led on and used as a distraction, then it's probably not a healthy relationship for you. You deserve someone who is honest and committed to you."

**Original poster's response:**

"Thank you all for your honest and thoughtful comments. I think I've been in denial about the situation and needed a reality check. I'm going to take some time to think about what I want and what's best for me. I appreciate your advice and will try to prioritize my own feelings and well-being. I'll keep you all updated on what happens next!"

TITLE: Me [22F] and my boyfriend[29 F] of 1yr 9m, I don't see him as a lover anymore but I don't want to break his heart by leaving.

POST: My boyfriend is lovely and quirky but for a few months now I have found it hard to be physically attracted to him. He makes me laugh and we have interesting conversations, but I now think of him as a close friend. 

He has low self esteem when it comes to our relationship because I suspect his ex made him feel like he didn't deserve her. 

I couldn't tell you when I first felt the lack of attraction towards him or if there was some kind of moment that sparked this in me. He is the longest relationship I have had by just over a year. 

What makes it worse is we always blatantly talk about marriage and kids, so it's like we're already settled down. It's nice to be comfortable with someone as I've never really been good at making friends or even interact with the opposite sex.

My main fear is hurting him as I do love him, I just don't want to lie to him or to lead him on any further than I already have.

TL;DR: I've lost attraction to my boyfriend of 1yr 9m and don't want to break his heart by leaving, but I don't want to lead him on either.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's better to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. It's better to hurt him now than to lead him on and potentially hurt him even more in the long run. You can say something like 'Hey, I love you as a person, but I don't feel the same level of attraction to you as I used to. I think we should take some time to figure out what we want and see if we can work through this together.'"
* "I think you should consider counseling. It might help you both work through your feelings and figure out what's going on. It's not uncommon for people to lose attraction to their partner over time, and it doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is doomed. But it does mean you need to have an open and honest conversation about it."
* "I think you're being really unfair to him. You've been together for almost two years and you're just going to up and leave him because you don't feel attracted to him anymore? That's not how relationships work. You need to have a real conversation with him about what's going on and see if you can work through it together."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling this way. Is it because of something specific that's changed in your relationship or is it just a general feeling? Once you can identify the root cause, you can start to work on it. And if it's just a general feeling, then maybe you need to re-evaluate whether this relationship is really right for you."
* "I think you should be honest with him, but also be prepared for the possibility that he might not want to work through it. You can't force someone to stay in a relationship if they don't feel the same way. But at least you'll know where you stand and can move on from there."

**Reddit's Takeaway:** The majority of commenters agree that honesty is the best policy in this situation. They suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings, and being prepared for the possibility that he might not want to work through it. Some commenters also suggest considering counseling to help work through the issue. A few commenters take a more critical tone, suggesting that the OP is being unfair to their boyfriend and that they should be more committed to the relationship. Overall, the comments emphasize the importance of communication and honesty in relationships.

TITLE: Me [22F] with my co-worker [22M] - I made it awkward, any advice?

POST: Got a new job. Trained with co-worker, we're friends, he's cool. Hang out sometimes. Drink after work with other co-workers. Briefly think he likes me. No idea if he does. Don't really entertain the thought. 

Work there for 3 weeks, briefly see co-worker daily, always nice interactions.

Co-worker invites me over to hang and stay the night. That sounds like code to me, so I mentioned I thought he was cool and that I'm not keen on staying the night because seeing other guy. Never brought up this guy before. Pretty personal to be sharing at work, my dating escapades. Co-worker must not have figured it out or stalked me online enough.

Co-worker is sad. Short sentences, suggests we don't hang out. Feel like I did something wrong. Mention the convo is weird, we "reset" and he invites me over again. This time another friend of his is coming. I've met him, we all get along very well. So everything is fixed right?

TL;DR: Co-worker invites me over, I decline citing I'm seeing someone. He's sad, we "reset" and he invites me over again with another friend. What did I do wrong?

---

**Top comments:**

* "You did nothing wrong. You were honest and clear about your relationship status. If he's sad, it's because he was hoping for something more and got rejected. Don't worry about it."
* "I think you did nothing wrong either. You were upfront and honest about your relationship. If he's still inviting you over, it's probably because he values your friendship and doesn't want things to be awkward."
* "I think you should be proud of yourself for being honest and not leading him on. It's okay to be friends with someone without romantic feelings. Don't worry about his sadness, it's not your problem."
* "You didn't do anything wrong, but you might want to consider having a conversation with him about what happened. He might be feeling confused or hurt, and a conversation could clear the air."
* "I think you should be careful about how you phrase things in the future. Saying 'I'm not keen on staying the night because seeing other guy' might have come across as a bit blunt. Maybe try rephrasing it to something like 'I'm not comfortable with that' or 'I don't think that's a good idea'."

**Subreddit's overall sentiment:** The community is generally supportive and understanding of the OP's situation. Many commenters agree that the OP did nothing wrong and that it's okay to be friends with someone without romantic feelings. Some commenters suggest that the OP should be proud of themselves for being honest and not leading the co-worker on. Others recommend having a conversation with the co-worker to clear the air and avoid any further awkwardness. Overall, the subreddit's sentiment is one of empathy and understanding.

TITLE: Me (20sf) with smelly gym guys (20s? 30s? M) duration a couple of weeks.

POST: I'm (20s f) a pretty avid runner. My apartment building has a small gym that I run at every day, the same time eacy night on week nights. I can't run outside as I am 9/10 on call for work and must be within 15 minutes of my laptop at all times. 

A couple of weeks ago 2 guys (20s? 30s?) started coming to this small gym at/slightly before the time I go. Great for them! Except they smell like sweaty funky taint marinated in ball funk. It's horrendous. I've seen people gag coming into the gym. Their miasma of stench is so pervasive you can almost taste it. Like I don't see how if you shower, launder your gym clothes, and wear deodorant you could possibly exude such a god awful BO fog. I suspect they don't do any of these things. 

It's a small apartment gym. There's really no gym management to complain to. Would it be an asshole move to talk to them about this? I'm not generally good with people and I can't think of a non terrible way to tell these guys they fucking reek. I'm normally anti passive aggressive notes but would a note do it?

TL;DR: Smelly gym guys at my apartment gym. I'm at a loss for how to address this without being an asshole. Help!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I feel you, OP. I've had to deal with similar situations before. I'd suggest trying to approach them in a non-confrontational way. Maybe strike up a conversation and casually mention how nice it is to have a clean gym. You could say something like, 'Hey guys, I love that you're using the gym! I've noticed it's been a bit... fragrant in here lately. Just wanted to mention that a little deodorant and showering can go a long way in keeping the gym smelling fresh.' Try to be friendly and non-judgmental, and see how they react."
2. **u/ gymrat3000**: "I'm a gym rat myself, and I can attest that some people just don't care about personal hygiene. If you're not comfortable talking to them directly, you could try talking to the building management or the gym's owner. They might be able to address the issue or provide some guidance on how to handle it. Alternatively, you could try to avoid them or run at a different time. Sorry you're having to deal with this, OP!"
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I'm with u/throwaway123456 on this one. Approach them in a friendly way and try to educate them on the importance of personal hygiene. You could also offer to lend them some deodorant or suggest a good gym bag to help them stay fresh. Remember, it's not about being an asshole, it's about being considerate of others. Good luck, OP!"
4. **u/anonymous12345**: "I've been in similar situations before, and I've found that sometimes people just need a gentle reminder. You could try leaving a note or sending a friendly message to the guys, saying something like, 'Hey guys, I love that you're using the gym! Just a friendly reminder that a little deodorant and showering can go a long way in keeping the gym smelling fresh.' Keep it light and friendly, and see how they react."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not about being an asshole, it's about being considerate of others. You're not asking them to change their entire lives, just to take a few extra minutes to shower and put on some deodorant. If they're not willing to do that, then maybe they're not the kind of people you want to be around. Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and consideration, and that includes having a clean and comfortable gym to work out in."

TITLE: When does the guy stop paying for dinner?

POST: I [27/M] recently got into a huge fight with my--now ex-- girlfriend [24/F].

We'd been dating for about 2 years at this point and I still largely pay for all of our meals as well as our apartment + utilities. I have a nice luxury loft apartment and she keeps a very small--think glorified storage closet--apt in a bad neighborhood. She literally never goes there except to pick up and drop off clothing because I don't have enough closet space for two people. She doesn't pay a penny to live in my apartment or drive my car (we split the gas costs even though she drives it 80% of the time for her work and I walk to work.)

We both have good jobs. I make about twice what she does, but I have crushing student debt that I'm trying to pay off as fast as possible. I pay off about $3.5K of student debt a month, which really cuts into my cash flow, as you can imagine. She has about 1/10 the student debt I have.

I recently started suggesting that we split our food bills more evenly. I suggested that she could pay for her own meals and I'd pay for mine. Obviously we'd still go on dates and I'd pay for her meals, but on a day to day basis, I suggested that we split the food costs.

We ended up getting into a huge fight and then lots of old, old stuff came out and we ended up breaking up.

At this point, the relationship issue is moot, but she was my first really seriously, long-term relationship.

TL;DR: I used to pay for all meals and living expenses, but I suggested we split food bills more evenly. She got upset and we broke up.

QUESTION: When does the guy stop paying for dinner? Is it ever okay for a guy to stop paying for dinner? Should I have just kept paying for everything and not said anything? Should I have just proposed a compromise instead of suggesting a full-on split?

---

This post is a great example of how relationships can be affected by financial issues. The OP (original poster) is struggling with student debt and feels that his girlfriend is not contributing enough to their relationship, particularly when it comes to financial responsibilities. He suggests splitting the food bills more evenly, which leads to a huge fight and ultimately, the breakup of the relationship.

The comments on this post are interesting, with some people agreeing with the OP that he should not have to pay for everything, while others think that he should have proposed a compromise instead of a full-on split. Some people also point out that the OP's girlfriend may have felt taken advantage of and that the OP's suggestion to split the bills more evenly may have been a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship.

This post highlights the importance of communication and compromise in relationships, particularly when it comes to financial issues. It also shows how financial stress can affect relationships and how important it is to find a balance that works for both partners. Ultimately, the post raises questions about when it is okay for a guy to stop paying for dinner and whether it is ever okay to suggest a full-on split in a relationship.

TITLE: [16/m] How should I approach this girl? [16/f]

POST: Let's start with background information about this girl

There's this girl that I really like. We're in science class and I have free period with her. I also sometimes pass by her on the way to class everyday. In Science Class, we show little glances of each other. I'd usually look at her for a few seconds and when she looks back, I either smile or look away. Sometimes we see each other and we both smile -- but it could be that she's talking with her friends as well.

In Gym class, we notice each other but she's with her group of friends and I'm with my own group of friends. Kind of hard to get to know her. Today in gym, we actually lined up against a wall and I was next to her. I was nervous since we were both talking to our own little group of friends I guess.

We always make eye contact in some way and I feel like she might show some interest in me too. I really have a huge crush on her. What's also interesting is that prom is coming up in about a month and I really want to ask her to it -- but then again I don't know her very well. Any advice?

TL;DR: I have a crush on a girl in my science class and we make eye contact sometimes. I want to ask her to prom but I don't know her well. How should I approach her?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're already making progress by making eye contact and smiling at her. Just be yourself and try to start a conversation with her. Maybe ask her about something she's interested in or something you have in common. Don't overthink it too much and just go for it." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I think you're reading too much into the eye contact and smiling. Just because you both smile at each other doesn't mean she's interested in you romantically. Maybe she just likes your sense of humor or something. Try to get to know her better before asking her to prom. Ask her about her interests, hobbies, etc. and see if you have any common ground." (u/skeptical_sarah)
* "I think you should try to get to know her better before asking her to prom. Maybe ask her to study for a test or something together. That way you can get to know her better and see if there's any chemistry between you two. And if she says no to prom, it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of other people out there." (u/relationship_advice_bot)
* "I think you should just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. If she's not interested, then at least you'll know and you can move on. But if she is interested, then you can start dating and see where things go. Just be respectful of her feelings and boundaries, and don't pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with."

TITLE: Stay put, or explore?

POST: So, Reddit, I have a query for you. I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year. I could stay there and be financially secure, and make enough to get by, and facilitate some lesser hobbies of mine, but I don't think i'd ever truly be happy working there, as my co-workers make it somewhat high-stress. 
   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post.

TL;DR: I'm 20, working at a stable but unfulfilling job in Michigan. A friend asked me to move to Aspen, Colorado with her. I have $6,000 saved up and am considering making the move. Should I take the leap or stay put?

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I made a similar move to Colorado a few years ago and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The scenery is incredible, the people are friendly, and the job market is decent. That being said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The cost of living is higher than you might expect, especially in Aspen. You'll want to make sure you have a solid plan in place for finding a job and affording the lifestyle you want. If you're willing to take the risk, I say go for it! But don't say I didn't warn you."
2. **electrical_engineer**: "As an electrical engineer, I can tell you that the job market in Colorado is actually pretty tough. You'll be competing with a lot of other qualified engineers for a limited number of jobs. That being said, if you're willing to take a chance and move to Aspen, you might be able to find something in the renewable energy or tech industries. Just be prepared to be flexible and open-minded about the type of job you take."
3. **AspenLocal**: "I've lived in Aspen for a few years now and I can tell you that it's a great place to live. The scenery is stunning, the people are friendly, and there's always something to do. That being said, it's not all fun and games. The cost of living is high, and you'll need to be prepared to make some sacrifices if you want to live here. If you're willing to take the risk, I say go for it! But make sure you have a solid plan in place for finding a job and affording the lifestyle you want."
4. **throwaway789**: "I'm a bit of a risk-taker, and I've made some big moves in my life. But I have to say, moving to Aspen on a whim might not be the best idea. You're talking about leaving behind a stable job and a familiar place, and moving to a new city with no job lined up. That's a lot of uncertainty and risk. I would suggest taking some time to think about it, and maybe doing some research on the job market and cost of living in Aspen before making a decision."
5. **MichiganNative**: "I'm a Michigan native myself, and I have to say that I'm a bit skeptical of the idea of moving to Aspen. It's a beautiful place, but it's also a very expensive place to live. You'll need to be prepared to make some sacrifices if you want to live there. That being said, if you're willing to take the risk, I say go for it! But make sure you have a solid plan in place for finding a job and affording the lifestyle you want."

TITLE: Revenge on a New Roommate

POST: I share an apartment with my boyfriend. There are two spare bedrooms which are a constant rotation of friends-in-need. We recently invited a friend to stay with us while she figures out what her next step in life is. 

Now, I want people to feel at home in my apartment, but she keeps moving things around so we can't find them, using things that aren't hers, and ruining our possessions. Her version of an apology is an explanation of her actions followed by, "So I'm sorry if I am guilty, but I don't think I am."

Last Sunday I got around to sorting through laundry she took it upon herself to wash. She ruined an expensive pair of fingerless mittens knit with alpaca yarn and she lost a prized shawl, gifted to me for being the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding this past summer. When I explained as much, and how I knew she was the guilty party, she insisted it wasn't possible she was at fault, and if she was, I shouldn't be upset with her for things she did weeks ago. 

You can understand, I'm pretty annoyed and generally disinterested in her disrespect. 

So I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed. I won't even wear any of it, but if she feels no remorse losing my shawl, I don't feel too guilty either.

TL;DR: New roommate is a nightmare, ruining my stuff, moving things around, and not apologizing properly. I'm taking petty revenge by keeping her clothes that got mixed in with my laundry.

COMMENT 1:
Oh man, I can feel the frustration radiating from this post! It sounds like she's taking advantage of your hospitality and not respecting your boundaries. I think your petty revenge is justified, especially since she's not showing any remorse. Keeping her clothes is a great way to teach her a lesson without being too harsh. Has your boyfriend talked to her about her behavior yet?

COMMENT 2:
I'm so with you on this! It's one thing to make a mistake, but it's another thing entirely to refuse to take responsibility for it. I think it's great that you're taking a stand and not letting her get away with it. You should also consider setting some clear boundaries with her about what's okay and what's not. Maybe make a list of "house rules" or something. Has she ever apologized sincerely or is it always just an explanation followed by "I'm sorry if I am guilty"?

COMMENT 3:
I'm a bit surprised you're not just kicking her out. I mean, it sounds like she's being really inconsiderate and disrespectful. But I guess that's not always an option. In any case, I think your petty revenge is a great way to show her that her behavior won't be tolerated. Just make sure you're not taking it too far and that you're not losing your cool. Remember to breathe and stay calm.

COMMENT 4:
I'm a bit of a weirdo, but I think you should take it a step further. Why not "accidentally" leave her clothes out in the open, or even better, put them in a visible spot like the living room or kitchen? That way, she'll get the message that her stuff is not welcome in your space. Just make sure you're not doing it in a way that's mean-spirited or hurtful. You want to teach her a lesson, not make her feel bad about herself.

COMMENT 5:
I'm so glad you're taking a stand! It's amazing how some people can be so inconsiderate and entitled. I think your boyfriend should definitely have a talk with her about her behavior. In the meantime, I think your petty revenge is a great way to show her that her actions have consequences. Just remember to stay calm and don't let her get under your skin. You're doing the right thing by setting boundaries and standing up for yourself. Keep being awesome!

TITLE: Have I been friendzoned?

POST: Before I begin,  let me tell you that I am a girl to avoid any confusion later. Also,  this is the boy I consider(ed?) my best friend. 

So me and this boy have been friends for 6 years and we're really close. We are both seniors in high school. He asked me out in October and dumped before Christmas. He gave me reasons like "I don't want to be in a relationship that will have to end when we part for college", "I'm done with high school dating", "I need to focus on myself right now" and the infamous "I just don't want to ruin our friendship". As much as it sucked to hear,  I accepted it. He kept sending me messages about how much he wanted me but couldn't have me. Fast forward to yesterday when he tells me he's dating someone. An ex-girlfriend. What?We still hang out and talk like we did before we were dating.

TL;DR: I was friendzoned by my best friend, he dumped me, and now he's dating an ex-girlfriend.

QUESTIONS:

* Have I been friendzoned?
* Should I be upset about him dating an ex-girlfriend?
* Should I still be friends with him?

**Top comments:**

1. **Friendzoned**: Yes, you've been friendzoned. He didn't want to ruin your friendship, but he also didn't want to commit to a relationship with you. He's moved on to someone else, and it's okay to be upset about that.
2. **Don't be friends with him**: Honestly, it's time to reevaluate the friendship. He's shown you that he's not interested in you romantically, and now he's dating someone else. You deserve better than someone who can't make up their mind.
3. **You're better off**: You're better off without him. He's not worth your time or energy. Focus on yourself and find someone who truly cares about you.
4. **Talk to him**: Have an honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're hurt and confused about his actions. You deserve to know why he chose to date an ex-girlfriend over you.
5. **Take care of yourself**: Remember that you're not alone. You have friends and family who care about you. Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness. You don't need someone who's not willing to commit to you.

TITLE: My BF [29 M] who has a history of abortions, told me [25 F], his GF of 6 months, that he no longer wants to have sex due to his fear of getting me pregnant.

POST: This weekend my boyfriend confessed that the reason why we haven't had sex in a couple weeks is that 'when things start going well' he ruins it by getting the girl pregnant.

I am a very sexual person and if I had it my way, I'd have sex everyday, multiple times a day. So when he drops this bomb, I really don't know how to take it. I take the pill religiously, however we do not wear condoms. 

He has always been very upfront about his past --- including the abortions that he's had with multiple exes. However, when he told me that he doesn't want to have sex until we're married and ready to have kids, I was taken aback.

I want to be there for my BF and support him in anyway possible. Is there anything that can help him with the guilt and anxiety that he's feeling? Have you ever experienced this personally? Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you!

TL;DR: BF has a history of abortions, tells me he no longer wants to have sex due to fear of getting me pregnant, and wants to wait until we're married and ready to have kids.

**Comments:**

* OP, I think it's great that you're willing to support your BF, but you need to have a serious conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries. You deserve to have a fulfilling sex life, and it's not fair to put your desires on hold indefinitely.
* I had a similar experience with my ex, who had a vasectomy after a previous pregnancy scare. It was hard for me to understand why he was so anxious about getting me pregnant, but I eventually realized that it was a deep-seated fear. You might want to try having an open and honest conversation with your BF about his feelings and see if there's anything you can do to help him feel more comfortable.
* OP, I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If your BF is willing to sacrifice your sexual desires and intimacy for his own anxiety, that's a red flag. You deserve better than to be treated like a potential baby-making machine.
* I'm not sure what to say, but I do think it's important to acknowledge that your BF's past experiences with abortion have likely had a profound impact on his psyche. It might be helpful for him to seek counseling or therapy to work through those feelings.
* OP, have you considered having a conversation with your BF about your own feelings and desires? It's possible that he's not aware of how much you value your sexual relationship, and a conversation might help him understand where you're coming from. Good luck!

TITLE: Reddit. I'm a 29 year old girl from the UK whose long term relationship has just ended. Where the hell do I even start dating?

POST: I was in a relationship with the same guy for long time years. We were never suited. Made a massive mistake, we broke up. Lost all but two friends who are already in relationships and settled. That was three months ago.

I don't want to pick up guys in bars, I hate clubs. I work with older women that are settled with families, babies and belong to nappy clubs or whatever parents do.

Online dating seems good but also from old work friends experiences it can be tedious. I'm willing to give it a go despite this but have no idea what to look out for. I also don't know where to meet single people in real life.

Although both my exes have told me I'm pretty, I really don't think I am so there the whole self esteem thing. I'm friendly and flirty, but would wait for a sign someone liked me. So if I were sat in a bar I wouldn't just walk up to a strange guy and give him my number. Once I know someone I've got no problems with making moves. The thought of speed dating fills me with fear.

TL;DR: 29 year old girl from the UK, recently single after long term relationship. No idea where to start dating, don't want to pick up guys in bars, don't know what to look out for online. Self-esteem issues, need advice on how to get back out there.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I'd recommend trying out social events like book clubs, hiking groups, or volunteer work. These places are great for meeting like-minded people who share similar interests. As for online dating, I'd suggest starting with apps like Hinge or Bumble. They're more focused on meaningful connections rather than just hookups. And don't worry about your self-esteem, you're beautiful and deserving of love!"

The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to find someone special. Also, don't worry about speed dating. It's not for everyone, and there are plenty of other ways to meet new people. Just be yourself, be open-minded, and have fun!"
3. **u/singleagain**: "OP, I'm a single woman in my late 20s, and I totally get where you're coming from. I'd recommend trying out social events like concerts, festivals, or sporting events.

TITLE: Reddit, I've been friendzoned by the only girl I've ever considered to be marriage material. What do I do?

POST: So here's how it is: We met in high school. Became friends. Dated briefly in Year 12, but it didn't work out because we were young and I was kind of stupid. 

Since then we've always been close, despite living 3 hours away from each other. Over about 4 years, I have had spouts of falling in love with her again, only to give up after always being friendzoned.

Now I should be clear: in the past this girl has always been a bit insecure, and she dated plenty of boys to feel better about herself. After she woke up and realised how unhealthy that was, she made a decision to be single for at least a year. Now, she's happy with herself, because she took steps to change her life (yep. she's a keeper.)

So here's where I'm at now: we're both single, and we both enjoy that for now. But we're also really, REALLY close. I am crazy about her, but I have no idea whether I should give up and drift apart, or whether this could turn into a relationship in the future.

TL;DR: I've been friendzoned by the girl I love, and I don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you've been friendzoned for years. It's time to accept that she doesn't see you as a romantic partner. You deserve better than to be stuck in limbo. Take a step back, focus on yourself, and try to move on. You never know, you might find someone who actually feels the same way about you."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Oh, poor you. You've been friendzoned by a girl who's been insecure and dated a bunch of guys. Sounds like she's got some major issues. Maybe you should be focusing on finding someone who actually values and respects you, rather than trying to fix someone else's problems."
3. **Redditor123**: "I think you're being too focused on the idea of'marriage material.' What about just being happy in a relationship? You've been friendzoning yourself for years, and it's time to take a chance. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. If she doesn't feel the same way, then at least you'll know and can move on."
4. **NotMyProblem**: "Honestly, dude, you're just not her type. She's moved on from her insecurities and is happy being single. You're just holding onto the past. Take a hint and move on. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."
5. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just stuck in the idea of being with her? You deserve to be happy, and if that means being with someone else, then so be it. Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't feel the same way about you."

TITLE: Feeling a bit under appreciated. How do I hint to him?

POST: So my SO and I have exchanged Christmas gifts quite early this year. I was pretty damn excited about him opening the gifts I got him -- all wrapped and tied with a bow and shit. 
Well, he pressured me to open mine. He told me to close my eyes. And at this moment, I'm all excited and shit. Then, he puts my hands around it. I open my eyes and its a little bottle of Honey Jack. Now, I love alcohol as much as the next person, but my heart just fell. I had gotten him something.. more sentimental. 
I got him this awesome Indiana Jonesy leather covered flask and a nice bottle of Abercromie & Fitch's Fierce cologne.
Well he opened his gift tonight,  and to see his face light up made me feel so happy. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed and not as appreciated. I'm really not a naggy, whiny SO. But this feeling leaves me a little sad and unimportant.  
Btw, we've been kinda together for a littler over a year.
What should I do? Should I tell him straight up? If I do and he gets a gift, ill feel like it's only because I told him and that would just defeat the purpose.

TL;DR: My SO gave me a bottle of Honey Jack instead of the sentimental gifts I got him. I'm feeling underappreciated. Should I tell him how I feel or just let it go?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like he didn't put much thought into your gift. Maybe try talking to him about it in a non-accusatory way? You could say something like 'Hey, I was really looking forward to opening your gift and was a bit surprised by the Honey Jack. I understand it's a nice gift, but I was hoping for something a bit more personal.'"
* "I think you should talk to him about it. But maybe don't phrase it as 'you didn't put thought into my gift.' Instead, focus on how you felt and what you were hoping for. It's okay to express your feelings and needs in a relationship. And who knows, he might not have realized how much you were looking forward to something more sentimental."
* "I think it's great that you're not naggy or whiny, but maybe try to communicate your feelings in a more constructive way. Instead of saying 'I feel underappreciated,' try saying 'I feel like we're not connecting on the same level when it comes to gifts. I was really looking forward to something more personal.'"
* "I think you should just let it go. It's just a gift, and it's not worth stressing over. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things you do have in common."
* "I think you should talk to him about it, but also try to understand where he's coming from. Maybe he didn't realize how much you were looking forward to something more sentimental. Maybe he was just trying to get you something he thought you'd like. Try to have an open and honest conversation about it and see where it takes you."

TITLE: My wife of three months threatened to move out.

POST: Backstory: Been with her for about 4 years, things were great.  3 months ago we get married. We both work a lot, opposite schedules, and rarely see each other.  We bought a farm together, and have been settling in there too. Gradually she has withdrawn to the point of frigidity, and basic intimacy, holding hands, kissing, smiling. She comes home exhausted and sits there, at times I have to wrestle basic sentences out of her.  She says it's stress from work, and not to worry. I started picking up her end of basic work around the house and farm to help her out with stress. Still though whenever I try to do anything special, or social with her she always resists it, with rules, stipulations, or being negative, and an overall close-minded downer. Not her personality at all, but there it is time and time again. Conversely, she also will go and hang out with her friends over night regularly with carefree ease.  

Yesterday, as I serve her breakfast she says that, she doesn't take care of me.

Whenever we have time off she flees from my presence. Today, Thanksgiving was no different.  She talks about driving over an hour away to her friends McMansion for a Walmart thanksgiving. I reminded her of years past when we have done that and she ended up being exhausted at the end of the day, she just got off a 15 hour shift. She also never framed it within the context of me coming along, and left me saying she was only going to be there a few hours. 

Even though she works at a grocery store and finds it impossible to bring food home. I went and got ingredients for at least a home cooked meal tonight.  Well I fell asleep, waiting for her. Got a text at one in morning saying that she was going midnight shopping.  So I finally called her out for being inconsiderate, and wish her a happy thanksgiving. 

She now wants to come get her dog and leave. Then goes on (via text) about how she constantly fails and pretends to be happy around me for months, and she should just grab her dog, who is attached at the hip to my dog, and leave.  

WTF?

TL;DR: Wife of 3 months, who used to be affectionate and loving, has become distant, withdrawn, and critical. She's been threatening to leave, saying she doesn't take care of me and that she's only pretending to be happy around me. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her and I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, it sounds like your wife is struggling with depression or anxiety. The fact that she's withdrawn and critical towards you is a classic symptom. I would recommend that you encourage her to seek professional help. Also, try to be more understanding and empathetic towards her. It's not about you, it's about her mental health."
2. **relationship_guru**: "OP, it's clear that your wife is going through a tough time. However, it's not okay for her to treat you like this. You deserve respect and affection in a relationship. I would suggest that you have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're there to support her, but you also need to feel seen and heard in the relationship."
3. **just_a_random_user**: "OP, I think you need to take a step back and assess your own behavior. Are you being overly critical or demanding? Are you giving her enough space and understanding? Sometimes, people pull away because they feel suffocated or overwhelmed. Try to be more mindful of your own actions and see if that makes a difference."
4. **experienced_couple**: "OP, we've been married for 20 years and we've been through our fair share of ups and downs. What I want to say is that relationships are about compromise and communication. It sounds like you're not communicating effectively with your wife, and that's causing tension. Try to have a conversation with her about what you both need and want from each other. And remember, relationships are a two-way street. You can't just focus on what your wife is doing wrong, you need to look at your own behavior as well."
5. **relationship_coach**: "OP, I think you're experiencing a classic case of 'emotional disconnection'. It's a common phenomenon where couples become disconnected from each other emotionally. I would recommend that you try to reconnect with your wife on an emotional level. Take the time to listen to her, understand her feelings, and show her that you care. You can do this by having meaningful conversations, sharing your feelings, and being present for each other."

TITLE: I [17M] was with my new girlfriend [17F] and I couldn't perform when it counted.

POST: So I haven't had the best luck with the ladies in my life, but I finally got a girlfriend and I'm crazy about her already. She's hot, smart, funny, everything I wanted in a girl. 

So we're at my place and things get hot and heavy and we begin kissing and taking off clothes. First off, the furthest I've gotten with a girl before this was a blowjob when I was drunk at a party. Anyway, clothes are off and I'm hard as a rock waiting to go.

I go down on her and I'm still rock hard and she climaxes and she's ready to return the favor to me. When she goes to blow me I start to go soft for some reason. I;m trying to concentrate on her and the generous, hot action she's doing but I just can't focus. I'm so confused and to compensate for that I go down on her again and the erection returns.

She says she wants me to fuck when I'm done going down on her and I get up to fuck her and I lose the hard on again. After that she was accepting and said we could wait (I'm still a virgin) for the next time we get together. I'm not sure why I kept losing the hard on when it mattered. If it changes anything I always over think things and I'm in my own head a lot. 

I talked to my best friend about and he said that I was probably nervous, but I'm completely ready to lose my virginity.

TL;DR: I'm 17, got a new girlfriend, and I couldn't get hard when it mattered. I'm a virgin and I'm not sure why this happened.

TITLE: Me [18 M] dating a [19 F] off and on for a year. Experiencing intense sadness and anxiety when away.

POST: I've been dating a girl off and on for about one year now.  Things have been complicated for a variety of reasons but it's finally stable and we've been going at it for about a month.  

I feel crazy for feeling this way and I acknowledge that, but I can't help it.  When we're hanging out it's fantastic, really fantastic for both of us.  Through everything we still have a stupid amount of fun together.  

The problem is that whenever I'm not hanging out with her, I become really sad and anxious thinking about the two of us and I can't stop it.  I assume it's a personal issue but I don't know how to fix it.

TL;DR: Dating a girl off and on for a year, things are stable now but I experience intense sadness and anxiety when we're apart.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel sad and anxious when you're not with someone you care about. It doesn't mean you're crazy or that there's anything wrong with you. Maybe try talking to your girlfriend about how you're feeling? She might be experiencing the same thing and you can work together to find ways to make the time apart more bearable.

COMMENT 2:
I totally get where you're coming from, OP. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough. One thing that might help is to focus on the things you enjoy doing on your own. Whether it's reading, playing music, or hiking, make time for yourself and do things that bring you joy. This can help distract you from the feelings of sadness and anxiety and give you a sense of fulfillment.

COMMENT 3:
I think you're being way too focused on the negative aspects of your relationship. Instead of dwelling on the time you're apart, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the time you spend together. Make a list of all the things you love and appreciate about your girlfriend and the things you enjoy doing together. This can help shift your focus away from the negative and towards the positive.

COMMENT 4:
OP, I think you're experiencing a classic case of separation anxiety. It's a common phenomenon, especially in relationships where there's a strong emotional connection. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge that it's a normal feeling and that it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you or your relationship. Maybe try some relaxation techniques, like meditation or deep breathing, to help manage your anxiety when you're apart.

TITLE: Let me [20m] tell you a story and afterwards ask you this: is Paula [18f] being a bitch?

POST: Let's say there's a guy called John [21m]. John kinda likes Paula and he wants her to think of him as a nice guy, get a good rep with her and such. John mentions Game of Thrones to her, and she says she's really into it, and also that she even read a few books before the show started airing.

John gets excited, because them both like the same thing a lot! Then he offers to lend her the dvd box of the second season, to be a nice guy and maybe win her heart little by little. She accepts!

Paula then proceeds to carry out the dvd box to another guy's house, watching the series with him as well as making out, on John's expenses. Is Paula a bitch?

TL;DR: John lends Paula a dvd box of Game of Thrones, she watches it with another guy and makes out with him, on John's expenses. Is Paula being a bitch?

---

**Comments:**

* "Yeah, that's definitely being a bitch. She took advantage of John's generosity and used it to get closer to someone else." (123 upvotes)
* "I don't think it's that simple. Maybe Paula didn't mean to hurt John's feelings, maybe she just got caught up in the moment and didn't think about the consequences." (56 upvotes)
* "John should've just asked her if she wanted to watch it with him instead of lending it to her. Then he wouldn't have gotten hurt." (34 upvotes)
* "Paula is a total bitch. She knew John liked her and she just used him to get what she wanted." (21 upvotes)
* "I think Paula is being a bit of a jerk, but maybe John should've communicated better with her. He lent her the DVDs without discussing it with her first, maybe he should've asked her if she wanted to watch it with him instead of lending it to someone else." (15 upvotes)

**Conclusion:** The majority of the commenters (123 upvotes) believe that Paula is being a bitch for taking advantage of John's generosity and using it to get closer to someone else. However, some commenters (56 upvotes) argue that Paula may not have meant to hurt John's feelings and that she may have just gotten caught up in the moment. The comments also highlight the importance of communication in relationships, suggesting that John should have asked Paula if she wanted to watch the DVDs with him instead of lending them to someone else. Overall, the post sparks a lively discussion about the ethics of relationships and the importance of considering others' feelings.

TITLE: Thoughts on a prenup

POST: I proposed last weekend. We've talked about it for a long time, I just finally got around to doing it. 

Now to the important stuff. We've been together for over 5 years, lived together for four. She's extremely responsible with her money, which is one of the reasons I haven't really thought I needed one. She pays me a set amount a month for rent, we just kind of split other things like groceries and such. I'd say I generally pay for going out to eat, vacations, etc. But I make a lot more than she does, so I don't have a problem with that. Even though we have separate accounts, I'd say we both consider things ours. I do own a house, but like I said, she's paying a little over a 3rd of that payment a month.

I don't want to sound like I have love blinders on, I'm a pessimist generally, but I can't really see the need for one. If something ever did happen where we got divorced, which I really can't see but I know people change, should I still get one? Honestly if that happened, I know myself, and I'd be civil and fair about who get's what, I could guarantee that. I really couldn't see her being any other way either, we're a lot a like that way.

We're not going to have kids, and if we did split, I'd feel she was owed at minimum, all of the money she paid towards the house, if not half of the house itself. 

So, should I still look into getting one? Feel free to be as critical as possible about my views on things. She already asked me if I wanted one, as I technically have more assets than her (even though I consider them ours), so getting one wouldn't be an issue. I feel the fact that she asked that speaks to her financial responsibility.

TL;DR: Proposed, considering getting a prenup. We're responsible, consider things ours, and I make more than her. Should I still get one? 

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should get one, not because you think you'll get divorced, but because it's a way to protect your assets and ensure that you're both on the same page financially. It's not about being pessimistic, it's about being prepared. And even if you do get divorced, having a prenup can make the process less messy and less expensive."
* "I agree with the above comment. A prenup is not just about protecting your assets, it's also about having a clear understanding of what you're getting into. It's a way to have a conversation about your finances and make sure you're both on the same page. And even if you do get divorced, having a prenup can make the process less stressful and less expensive."
* "I think you're being a bit naive about the possibility of divorce. Even if you think you're compatible and responsible, things can change. A prenup is a way to protect yourself and your assets in case things don't work out. And even if you do get divorced, having a prenup can make the process less painful and less expensive."
* "I think you should get one, but also have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your financial goals and expectations. A prenup is not just about protecting your assets, it's also about having a clear understanding of what you're getting into. And even if you do get divorced, having a prenup can make the process less messy and less expensive."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the financial aspects of a prenup. A prenup is also a way to protect your emotional well-being and ensure that you're both on the same page. It's not just about protecting your assets, it's also about having a clear understanding of what you're getting into. And even if you do get divorced, having a prenup can make the process less painful and less expensive."  |

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* The majority of commenters recommend getting a prenup, citing the importance of protecting assets, having a clear understanding of financial goals and expectations, and preparing for the possibility of divorce.
* Some commenters suggest having an open and honest conversation with your partner about financial goals and expectations, in addition to getting a prenup.
* A few commenters express concern that the OP is being too optimistic about the possibility of divorce and suggest that a prenup is a way to protect oneself and one's assets in case things don't work out.
* The commenters generally agree that a prenup is not just about protecting assets, but also about having a clear understanding of what you're getting into and preparing for the possibility of divorce.

TITLE: I [18 M] have a crush on my [18 F]friend, not sure if she has a crush on me too.

POST: So, I have a crush on this girl since I met her in our freshman year of highschool. I think she has had a crush on me too, but I'm not sure.

 
She once put her phone on my cellphone without me asking for it. She gave me a nickname which none of my other friends use, and I love when she calls me by that nickname (I also have a nickname for her, that only I use). She would also sit beside me in all classes. She liked to hold hands with me "because of the cold", but then, no matter how the weather was, I would just grab her hand, or she would grab mine, just for the sake of holding hands. A friend of mine (female) always said that it was weird. 

The problem is, she's living in another city now. She is visiting her mom in my city, and I asked her out last Sunday, and I was planning to tell her about my feelings. But I didn't. We had a great time, talked for a couple of hours that felt like a couple of minutes, but in the end I couldn't say anything. 

She's leaving this Saturday, and I said I wanted to see her again because I had something to tell her. I think she already knows what it is about (after this text, anyway).

What do you guys think? Is it possible that she has a crush on me?

TL;DR: I have a crush on my friend, but I'm not sure if she has a crush on me too. We've had some close moments, but I didn't tell her about my feelings when I had the chance. Now she's leaving and I want to know if I should tell her or not.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're already thinking about this too much. Just be honest with her and tell her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, then at least you'll know and can move on. If she does feel the same way, then you can start something new. Either way, it's better to be honest and take the risk than to wonder what could've been."
* "I think you should tell her, but make sure you're prepared for any outcome. If she doesn't feel the same way, it might be awkward for a bit, but you can still maintain a friendship. If she does feel the same way, then you can start something new and exciting. Just be genuine and respectful, and I'm sure it'll work out either way."
* "I think you're overthinking this. You've had some close moments, but that doesn't necessarily mean she has a crush on you. Just be yourself and see how things go. If she doesn't feel the same way, then you can still be friends and move on. If she does feel the same way, then you can start something new. Either way, it's not the end of the world."
* "I think you should tell her, but make sure you're not putting too much pressure on the situation. Just be honest and see how she reacts. If she doesn't feel the same way, then you can still be friends and move on. If she does feel the same way, then you can start something new. Just be respectful and genuine, and I'm sure it'll work out either way."
* "I think you're being too cautious. You've had some close moments, and you should take the chance to tell her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, then you can still be friends and move on. If she does feel the same way, then you can start something new. Just be yourself and see how things go. It's not the end of the world if it doesn't work out."

TITLE: Foot swollen after Salicylic acid wart treatment

POST: Hi there,

Basically, I have had a plantars wart on my right big toe for almost two years and the past couple weeks I have been fighting it pretty relentlessly. I have been doing freeze treatments, applying salicylic acid, and removing layers of dead skin.

The last time I removed skin was on Monday night. I got deep enough that I felt I was almost at the base of the wart. In an attempt to get closer to the bottom, I picked at the wart with my pocket knife (consistently disinfected the knife and my foot with lots of rubbing alcohol and wore gloves). I got deep but only deep enough to draw a tiny amount of blood. I then started reapplying my Salicylic acid treatment to the area from that night until this (Wednesday) morning.

Today, my toe was very sore all day at work, and stung fairly sharply on the spot of my wart. I figured it might be from the salicylic acid, so when I got home from work, I soaked my toe in apple cider vinegar in an attempt to remove the dried acid. However, this didn't get rid of all of it. Also, at this point, I realized my toe and was getting fairly warm and swollen, and that the rest of my foot was getting a bit warm as well. After this, I took some isopropyl alcohol and a knife, and gently rubbed/peeled away all the visible dried acid left on my toe. However, my toe doesn't feel any better. I am currently laying with it raised and covered in neosporin.

Long story short, should I be concerned about some sort of infection or anything? Or could this just be a normal response to my treatment? I have no known allergies, other serious medical conditions, or anything like that. I am a 20 year old white male and am (hopefully) healthy.

Thank you!

TL;DR: I treated my plantars wart with salicylic acid and removed dead skin, but now my toe is swollen and sore. Should I be concerned about infection or is this normal?

---

**DOCTOR'S RESPONSE:**

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to treat your plantars wart.

Firstly, it's not uncommon for the area around a wart to become swollen and sore after treatment, especially when using salicylic acid. This is because the acid can cause irritation and inflammation, which can lead to swelling and discomfort.

However, it's also possible that you may have caused some minor trauma to the area when you used your pocket knife to remove dead skin. This could have led to some bleeding, which may have introduced bacteria into the wound. As a result, you may be at risk of developing an infection.

To address your concerns, I would recommend the following:

1. Continue to keep the area clean and dry. Make sure to wash your toe with soap and water, and dry it thoroughly, especially between the toes.
2. Apply a topical antibiotic ointment, such as Neosporin, to the affected area to help prevent infection.
3. Consider taking an oral antibiotic, such as amoxicillin or cephalexin, if you experience any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus.
4. Avoid picking or scratching at the wart, as this can further irritate the area and increase the risk of infection.
5. Consider consulting a dermatologist or podiatrist for further guidance and treatment. They may be able to provide additional advice or prescribe a topical or oral medication to help manage your symptoms.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to treating skin conditions. If you're unsure about the best course of treatment or experience any signs of infection, it's always best to seek medical attention.

I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
[Doctor's Name]

TITLE: Me[23F] was dumped 4 months ago. Need some advice about getting back into dating

POST: My boyfriend left me four months ago. We had been together almost three years. I really felt that the breakup was devastating. It took me a bit of time to get to where I am now. I realized that our relationship was unhealthy and my SO treated me poorly. I finally feel like my self again and I am happy in my life.

I'd really like to go out and meet new people. I'm not really sure where to start. I'm worried it is going to feel strange. I'm worried about being awkward. I was completely committed to one person for almost 3 years. It seems it will be hard to open up. I'd love any advice on how to get back out there.

TL;DR: I was dumped 4 months ago after 3 years. I'm ready to start dating again, but I'm nervous about being awkward and opening up to new people.

COMMENTS:

It's normal to feel nervous about dating again, but remember that you're not the same person you were 4 months ago. You've grown and learned from your experience.

Just enjoy the process and see where it takes you."

Don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out right away. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. You got this!"
* "OP, you're doing great! It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the unhealthy relationship and take steps to move forward. Remember that you're not alone and many people have been in your shoes.

Keep being your amazing self and the universe will conspire to bring you someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are."
* "I think it's great that you're taking the time to focus on yourself and heal before jumping back into dating. It's okay to take your time and not rush into anything. Remember that you're not the same person you were 4 months ago, and that's a good thing! You've grown and learned from your experience. When you do start dating again, try to focus on building connections with people rather than trying to find 'the one.' Good luck, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way!"

TITLE: Me [25 M] was dumped by my [23 F] on my birthday and now she is in a relationship with my friend.

POST: She broke up with me on my birthday 7 months ago, ending a 7 month relationship, because I didn't contribute to the rent, I stayed at her apartment and went to my college classes. She said 3 days earlier that she would breakup with me if I didn't find a job in 2 weeks, she broke her word. She said that I wasn't mature enough for a relationship. She told me not to get stuck on her and that I would find another girl. 

Then as of recently we stopped being friends with benefits because she has a new squeeze: my friend who I introduced her to. He told her to ignore me and she complied and now I am being treated like the bubonic plague. She threatened to throw out some of my clothes if I didn't give her marijuana and ever since(a full month later) she is still ignoring me.

I would really like to get her back, but I understand that might not be an option. I am struggling for the first time in my life to be independent and will soon move to a state where I can start the business I want to but it will take some time before I am successful enough to support her and give her what she gave to me. 

Personally it hurts but it seems like the best option is to move on, still I am having a hard time getting over her and I feel like she is telling me to fuck off. I think we both made mistakes but I think that her actions are unacceptable.

How should I deal with this and how do I have healthier relationships in the future? And how do I deal with this heartbreak?

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend broke up with me on my birthday, now she's in a relationship with my friend, and is ignoring me. I'm struggling to move on and want to know how to deal with this and have healthier relationships in the future.

**Top comments:**

1. "OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like your ex was emotionally abusive and used you for her own convenience. You deserve so much better than that. Take your time to heal and focus on yourself. You're going to come out of this even stronger and more resilient. Don't waste your time trying to get her back, she's clearly not interested in you as a person."
2. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're taking responsibility for her actions, which is not your fault. You did what you thought was best at the time, and it's not like you were trying to hurt her. You're a good person, and you deserve to be happy. Don't let her toxic behavior define your self-worth."
3. "OP, I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate what you want in a relationship. You said she broke up with you because you weren't contributing to the rent, but you also said you were going to college. It sounds like you were in a relationship with someone who was using you for financial support. You deserve someone who respects and supports you, not uses you. Don't settle for anything less."
4. "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's clear that your ex is a toxic person who doesn't care about your feelings or well-being. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing. Don't waste your time trying to get her back or prove anything to her. You're better off without her. Take care of yourself and remember that you're worthy of love and respect."
5. "OP, I think you need to take a break from social media and distance yourself from your ex and her new boyfriend. It's clear that they're trying to hurt you, and you don't need that kind of negativity in your life. Focus on yourself, your goals, and your future. You're going to come out of this even stronger and more resilient. Don't let them define your happiness."

TITLE: Help a middle-aged new college graduate improve my situation

POST: I'm not actually graduating until next spring, but I thought that this would be a good time to ask, so I have plenty of time to get things in order or to possibly pursue some of the things that are advised.

Here's the story: I'm 35 years old, a Marine Corps veteran and a married father of 3. At this time, my wife doesn't earn much at all and we're barely making it on my blue-collar income of around 43-48k/year (depends on overtime availability).

I hate my job, and I'm finally finishing up my degree so that I can move into something else. Unfortunately, I've heard too many horror stories about recent grads being offered $13-15/hour and taking it because it's actually pretty good, relative to other offers or opportunities.

I'm terrified that despite my education, I won't be able to move into anything that pays more than I'm currently making "right out of the gate", so to speak.

I'm not afraid to move if I have to, and I can learn pretty much anything I need to. My BA will be in "Integrative Leadership Studies", which is just a generic Adult Degree program at my college.

I'm not afraid to continue on to a graduate program, but I'd like to leave my current job first, if at all possible.

Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, married father of 3, finishing up a BA in Integrative Leadership Studies. Worried about being stuck in a low-paying job after graduation. Seeking advice on how to improve my situation.

TITLE: Me [38 M] with my Fiancee [27 F] of one and a half years, I found out she cannot leave me because of financial reasons

POST: About 8 months ago we had a very bad fight. She had caught me in a lie (nothing about cheating, but it was something I lied about my past that was important to her). She was on the verge of breaking up with me. All of a sudden, we were fine about a few weeks later, and we rarely fought about that reason. 

Now, I just came to realize after a breakdown she had, that she may actually want to break up with me but she can't because she relies upon me greatly (much greater than I thought) for financial reasons. Basically she'd be out on the street and so would her mom (she sends her money from her part time job). If it were only her she said she could be "free" in her own words (but I think she might have been implying that she *would* be free if she had the chance.

I'm not 100% sure what she was saying, that she *would* definitely not be with me now if it weren't for financial support, or that she is just upset because she doesn't at least have that choice. 

I can't figure it out, and I am devistated obviously! She just went to sleep and I don't even know what to do. 

I don't want to force someone to be with me while they don't want this, love isn't a one way street. Even if she tries to "make the best of it" to be with me, I only want someone with me who's in it 100%, especially since we plan on getting married. 

What to do? If I leave her because she's not 100% (or so I think) I would feel guilty, on top of that, her and her mom on the street (or at the very best couch surfing with relatives).

TL;DR: Fiancee of 1.5 years can't leave me because of financial reasons, but I'm not sure if she wants to stay with me or is just stuck. I'm devastated and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "You're right to be concerned about her feelings and well-being, but you also deserve to be with someone who is 100% committed to you. Have an honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It's better to have an open and honest conversation than to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for you."
* "I think you're being too focused on the financial aspect. It's not just about the money, it's about the emotional dependence. You need to consider whether you're enabling her or if she's truly committed to you. Have a conversation with her about your feelings and see how she responds."
* "I think you're being too harsh on yourself. You're not forcing her to stay with you, she's choosing to stay because of financial reasons. You need to consider whether you're willing to continue the relationship under these circumstances. If not, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it's healthy for you."
* "I think you're being too focused on your own feelings and not considering hers. She's stuck in a difficult situation and you're not giving her the support she needs. You need to have a conversation with her about her feelings and concerns, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I think you're being too quick to judge her. Maybe she's not as committed to you as you think, but maybe she's also not as stuck as you think. Have a conversation with her and see what she has to say. Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions."

**OP's Response:**

* "Thank you all for your input. I think I'm going to have a conversation with her tomorrow and see where it takes us. I want to make sure I'm not enabling her or holding her back from being the person she wants to be. I also want to make sure she knows that I'm not willing to stay in a relationship that's not 100% for me. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes."
* "I had the conversation with her today and it was really tough. She said that she does feel stuck and that she's been feeling guilty about it for a while. She also said that she loves me and wants to make it work, but she's not sure if she can make the sacrifices she needs to make to be with me. I told her that I need her to be 100% committed to me and that I'm not willing to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for me. We're going to take some time to think about it and see what we can do to make it work."

TITLE: How can my [25/m] boyfriend and I[23/f] split the holidays?

POST: I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last 2 years, when Thanksgiving and Christmas came along, we spent it with our own families. His family lives 5 hours away from my family, so it's not very realistic to spend one day with one family, and then go to the other one's the next day. I would really love to spend a holiday with my boyfriend, but I feel bad for my parents. His family makes a much bigger deal out of holidays than mine, and he likes his family a lot more than I like my family so I can't convince him to come spend the holiday with my family. Thanksgiving is tomorrow and I could still go with him to his parent's house over mine, but I hardly ever see my parents. My parents are currently spending a lot of money on me to put me through school, so I feel like it's really selfish of me to ditch my parents to spend Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family.

So I guess the main question is: Should I go ahead and finally spend a holiday with my boyfriend of 3 years, or should I spend it with my parents since they've been such good parents and I feel bad?

And for another question... How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future so that everyone is happy?

TL;DR: I'm torn between spending Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family or my own family. His family makes a big deal out of holidays and I feel bad for my parents who are spending a lot of money on me. How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to make everyone happy. Why don't you talk to your boyfriend about how you're feeling? Maybe he's willing to compromise and spend a day with your family, or you could spend a day with his family and then meet up with your parents for a smaller celebration. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires sometimes."
2. **RelationshipAdviceGuru**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not selfish to want to spend the holiday with your boyfriend, especially after 3 years together. You can always make it up to your parents by spending quality time with them on another day. And who knows, maybe your boyfriend's family will even appreciate having you there! Just communicate with your boyfriend and come up with a plan that works for both of you."
3. **SkepticalSarah**: "I'm a bit confused - why do you feel like you have to choose between your boyfriend and your parents? Can't you just spend the holiday with both of them? It's not like you're going to be stuck with your boyfriend's family for the rest of the day. You could always take a break and go visit your parents later. It's not that big of a deal."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should prioritize your relationship with your boyfriend. You've been together for 3 years, and it's normal to want to spend special occasions with the person you love. Just make sure to communicate with your parents and explain the situation to them. They might understand that you want to spend time with your boyfriend, especially if they know how much you care about him."
5. **RealisticRuth**: "I think you're overthinking this. It's just one holiday, and it's not the end of the world if you don't spend it with your parents. You can always make it up to them later. And who knows, maybe your boyfriend's family will even become a part of your holiday traditions in the future. Just relax and enjoy the day with your boyfriend!"

TITLE: I hate a majority of the females in my age group.

POST: 23 year old male here. I don't know what else to say about this other than I hate the personalities of the 21 to 28 year old female population. A majority of them are completely superficial and have no drive beyond being the pretty girl or the object of physical desire. Having a conversation with them is like pulling teeth and hardly consists of any real or meaningful topics. Drinking, social media, and 'pretty' things. Basically the only three things that matter to women in this age bracket.

I know I know... This is not true for everyone/fuck stereotyping/everyone is an individual bullshit. But seriously, take a look at your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account. You'll find a majority of this to be true. And of course you'll find the great ones who are just awesome people, but I feel like they are rare and very much exceptions to the rule. 

I compare them to the women I work with, who are around 30+ years of age, and the personal experiences I have had with them. A higher percentage of these women are incredibly funny with a deeper sense of humor, enjoy a broad range of topics in conversation, and treat people with much more respect. 

I guess the

TL;DR: I hate the personalities of most women in my age group, finding them superficial and lacking in meaningful conversations. I compare them to older women who seem more mature and respectful.

**REPLIES:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Dude, you're just not trying hard enough. You're probably not putting in the effort to get to know these women beyond their surface level. Try having a real conversation with one and you might be surprised.
2. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I'm a 25 year old woman and I have to say, I'm a bit offended by your post. Just because we're not all about "meaningful conversations" doesn't mean we're not intelligent or capable of having deep discussions. Maybe you're just not meeting the right people?
3. **u/oldman_yells_at_clouds**: I'm an old man and I've seen a lot of things. I think you're just experiencing the natural evolution of society. Women are becoming more empowered and confident, and that means they're not afraid to be themselves and not care about what others think. Maybe you should try embracing this change instead of complaining about it.
4. **u/just_a_random_guy**: I'm a 28 year old man and I have to agree with you. I've had my fair share of shallow conversations with women in my age group. But I think it's also important to recognize that there are many women out there who are intelligent, funny, and interesting. You just have to look harder to find them.
5. **u/moderator**: Hey, let's keep the discussion civil and respectful. Remember, there are many women out there who are more than just their physical appearance. Let's focus on having a constructive conversation instead of making generalizations or stereotypes.

TITLE: Filming inside an airport, is it illegal?

POST: Ok, heres the story:

I was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us "We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there." There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer "You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!" (in portuguese). 

Thats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: "You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away." I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. 

So reddit? Is it wrong to film inside an airport? Was she right and I wrong?

TL;DR: Filmed a chaotic scene at the TAP transfer desk in Lisbon airport, got told to stop by a lady claiming to be from the press. Was I wrong to film? Is it illegal to film inside an airport?

**Top comments:**

* "It's generally not illegal to film in a public place like an airport, but there may be specific areas or activities that are restricted. However, it's always a good idea to be respectful of others and avoid causing a disturbance."
* "I think the lady was trying to intimidate you into stopping filming. As a passenger, you have the right to film in a public area like an airport, as long as you're not causing a disturbance or violating any specific rules."
* "It's not illegal to film in an airport, but it's always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and avoid causing a disturbance. If you're filming in a specific area that's restricted, you may be asked to stop or leave."
* "I think the lady was trying to protect her own interests, not necessarily the airport's. As a passenger, you have the right to film in a public area like an airport, as long as you're not causing a disturbance or violating any specific rules."
* "It's not illegal to film in an airport, but it's always a good idea to be respectful of others and avoid causing a disturbance. If you're filming in a specific area that's restricted, you may be asked to stop or leave."

* Follow the rules of the subreddit and the community.
* Be honest and transparent in your posts and comments.

* Be aware of your surroundings and avoid filming in restricted areas.

**Conclusion:**

Filming in a public place like an airport is generally not illegal, but it's always a good idea to be respectful of others and avoid causing a disturbance. If you're filming in a specific area that's restricted, you may be asked to stop or leave. It's also important to be aware of your surroundings and avoid filming in areas that may be considered sensitive or private. In this case, the lady may have been trying to intimidate the OP into stopping filming, but it's ultimately up to the OP to decide whether or not to continue filming. As a passenger, the OP has the right to film in a public area like an airport, as long as they're not causing a disturbance or violating any specific rules.

TITLE: My girlfriend [24/F] wanted to break up with me [23/F] - did I wrong her?

POST: We've dated for about a month and a half. She wanted a serious relationship. To preface the situation - she told me about a time when she was having exams, and she vomited. Her parents or boyfriend at the time would take care of her.

I came down with a bad fever and was coughing blood. I took a week off school and work. She took time off studying to spend half a day taking care of me. Two days later, she has her final exam. While I'm at home recovering, she calls me to let me know that she feels extremely ill and threw up in the middle of her exam. I tell her that she should call 911 immediately as I won't be able to come to her and she does that, and is hospitalized for the day. I do not visit her, as I feel quite sick and fear that I may have passed something to her.

The next day, she goes home to recover, but is still feeling quite down. I go to visit my parents to pick up some mail. I ask if she needs anything at this time, and she declines, telling me that she doesn't need me to help her now.

A week later, she tells me that she wants to break up over the situation. Her friend had to take care of her in the hospital, and he asked where her boyfriend (me) was. She also pointed out that I was feeling good enough to visit my parents. I was still coughing blood and had a fever at that point, and wasn't thinking very clearly. I had feared that I may have passed something to my girlfriend and that visiting her in the hospital could be bad for both of us.

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to break up with me because I didn't visit her in the hospital when she was sick, and I didn't take care of her when she was feeling down. I was still recovering from my own illness and was worried about passing something to her.

QUESTIONS:

* Was I wrong to not visit her in the hospital?
* Was I wrong to not take care of her when she was feeling down?
* Should I have prioritized her needs over my own recovery?
* How can I make it right with her?

* "I think you were wrong to not visit her in the hospital. As a partner, it's your job to be there for each other, even when it's hard. You should have found a way to make it work, even if it meant taking precautions to avoid getting her sick." - u/relationshipadvice
* "I understand where you're coming from, but not visiting her in the hospital was a huge red flag for me. You should have prioritized her needs over your own recovery. It's not about being selfish, it's about

TITLE: Me [32 M] with my friend/ex [24 F] "together" for a year put the nail in the coffin.

POST: I was just staring at this text box for the longest time. Just thinking about what I wanted to say. and in the end its not like a long drawn out story will make any difference. I just want to vent. 

The title says what happened. this girl i had been associating with we were a great team, always fun, always laughs always a good time. we were close. she came onto me strong out of her relationship. but in the end decided to go back to him.

perhaps not directly, but her life is such a mess and he is the only one that can give her stability because he does everything she asks him to. always awaiting a command always willing to let her if need be even cheat on him so long as it suits her needs.

I didn't let that happen. and its caused such a rift between us that its now over. and here i sit. day 5 into no contact. not because i want to get her back but just because i can't deal with the pain knowing her ex is always around or some other guy is always around. the questions the insecurity the sleepless nights wondering if she's snuggling up to another man that's not me. 

She contact me on the second day of no contact sending me a video of her doing cute things basically a movie version of a selfie and how she couldn't stop thinking about me. I ignored it answered the next day saying "loved the video" and that was it. She keeps liking my pics on instagram its like she's still with me but not. its just silence. 

i'm a wreak, drinking, smoking non stop. but all i can do is drown out the pain. and hope for a better tomorrow. Nobody needs to respond to this. I just wanted to vent.

TL;DR: I was with my friend/ex for a year, she came onto me while in a relationship, but went back to him. I'm struggling with the pain of no contact and the thought of her being with someone else. I'm trying to drown my sorrows but it's not working.

TITLE: My [18M] Girlfriend [17F] lives in an abusive household

POST: Hello, Reddit.  I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.

First off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.

My girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  

Even when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.

My mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.  I would love to hear reddit's opinion and if you guys think there's anything we can do to help her.  We are all here to support and and do whatever we can.

TL;DR: My 17-year-old girlfriend lives in an abusive household with her bipolar mother who physically and emotionally abuses her and her siblings.  Her mother tries to control every aspect of her life and even goes on her social media accounts to read her conversations.  I want to know if there's anything we can do to help her.

TITLE: I'm [M20] worried about emotional manipulation from girlfriend [F20].

POST: I've found recently that my girlfriend has been saying things which make me feel uncomfortable dye to the way they're said. We're not doing great at the minute so I'm concerned this is changing my thinking. 

Essentially, we had an argument recently and now talking between us is more stilted (we're in different countries right now, by the way). The things that have me worried are when she says things like she needs to talk to me to distract her from thinking about hurting herself and that she "hopes I know" she's depending on me to make her happy. 

I don't want to seem overly selfish, I'm concerned about that. Of course I want to help and I have for as long as we have been dating (around a year and a half now). It just feels like some of these things are more of a threat than asking for help. This is partially caused by the fact that when I try to offer suggestions they're met with rejection as being too hard, not what she wants as the solution or simply as not going to work. 

I feel guilty writing this and I feel guiltier that I've been considering the future of our relationship recently. It feels like she's making sure I know just how guilty I should feel if I left. This is made worse by her recently accusing me of fostering her dependency on me while I'm not dependant on her (I'm not sure how I did this and when I tried to offer her ways of becoming more independent they were shot down). 

Am I being selfish here and thinking too much about my self, not enough about her? I do want to help and I don't want to make it all about me but these thoughts keep coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do so any advice is appreciated. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before?
Am I wrong here and being overly defensive or is this manipulative?
Most importantly, where do I go from here?

TL;DR: I'm worried about emotional manipulation from my girlfriend. She says things that make me feel uncomfortable and I'm not sure if I'm being selfish or not. I want to help but I feel like she's making me feel guilty for even considering the future of our relationship.

**Top comments:**

1. "I think you're being very reasonable and not selfish at all. It sounds like your girlfriend is using guilt trips and emotional manipulation to control the relationship. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how her words and actions are making you feel."
2. "I've been in a similar situation before, and it's not okay. Your girlfriend is using emotional manipulation to keep you in the relationship, and it's not healthy. You deserve better than to be guilt-tripped and made to feel responsible for her happiness. Take some time to think about what you want and need in the relationship, and don't be afraid to set boundaries or re-evaluate the relationship if necessary."
3. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel uncomfortable and unsure about how to navigate a situation like this. The important thing is that you're recognizing the manipulation and wanting to do something about it. Consider seeking outside help, such as couples therapy, to work through these issues and develop healthier communication habits."
4. "I think you're being too focused on your own feelings and not considering your girlfriend's perspective. Maybe she's saying these things because she's genuinely struggling and needs your support. Instead of accusing her of manipulation, try to have a more empathetic conversation and see if you can find a way to support each other better."
5. "I think you're being too quick to assume the worst about your girlfriend. Maybe she's not trying to manipulate you, but rather is struggling with her own emotions and needs your support. Instead of jumping to conclusions, try to have a more open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can find a way to work through these issues together."

TITLE: I think my beagle is sick. Can anyone offer any insight/share any similar experiences? (x-post /r/beagle)

POST: So last Friday (March 29th) my 5 and a half year old beagle, Miles, started acting weirdly. He would start shaking and quietly whining. My family and I chalked it up to being in a new environment since we brought him to stay with us overnight at my grandparents' new home. This wasn't too worrying to us, since Miles is epileptic (relatively common among beagles) and we assumed he was having a mild seizure. But the problem persisted through the night and every couple hours he would start shaking again on every inhale. Also, he refuses to jump onto the furniture he knows he's allowed on; he chooses to stay on the floor and whine or I have to pick him up to be on the furniture with me. What I noticed starting yesterday is that he seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches. I tried lightly poking him in those areas every couple of hours and every time I do, he yelps. 

Throughout all of this I noticed what worries me the most. As any beagle owner would know, beagles can't shut up around food. Never before has Miles acted calm around food, let alone slept in his kennel during Easter lunch in a strange environment. He won't run up to snatch a treat out of my hand, either. I have to offer it to him a few inches from his nose, or, if I throw it on the floor he might be bothered to mosey on over and chomp it up very slowly. 

Does anyone know what may be wrong with him?

TL;DR: My 5.5-year-old beagle, Miles, has been acting strangely for a few days. He's been shaking, whining, and refusing to jump onto furniture. He seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches, and is acting out of character around food. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

---

**Comments:**

* "I'm no expert, but it sounds like Miles might be experiencing some kind of pain or discomfort. Have you taken him to the vet yet? It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to our furry friends."
* "I've had a similar experience with my beagle, Luna. She started acting weirdly and wouldn't eat for a few days. Turned out she had a urinary tract infection. Make sure to get Miles checked out ASAP."
* "I'm not a vet, but I've heard that beagles can get pancreatitis, which can cause them to act lethargic and not want to eat. Maybe that's what's going on with Miles?"
* "I've had experience with beagles and seizures. If Miles is having seizures, it's possible that he's having them more frequently or that they're getting worse. You should definitely take him to the vet to get checked out."
* "I'm not sure what's going on with Miles, but I do know that beagles can be prone to certain health issues. Have you considered taking him to a specialist, like a canine rehabilitation therapist or a veterinary acupuncturist? They might be able to help you figure out what's going on and provide some relief for Miles."

**Score:** 22 points (upvotes) and 10 comments. The post has been shared on other subreddits, including r/beagle, where it received additional comments and upvotes. The OP (original poster) has not yet responded to the comments, but it's likely that they will provide an update on Miles' condition and any treatment he may have received. The post has sparked a lively discussion about beagle health issues and the importance of seeking veterinary care when a pet is acting strangely.

TITLE: [insurance] I can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family

POST: Okay... Long story short.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. 

We went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)

I would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.

Sorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.

TL;DR: I'm struggling to afford insurance for myself and my family. I've tried to navigate the system, but it seems like there's no way to get affordable coverage. I'm looking for advice or advocacy services that can help me get my family the insurance we need without breaking the bank.

RESPONSES:

* "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered reaching out to a local non-profit organization that provides health insurance assistance? They may be able to help you navigate the system and find more affordable options. Additionally, you may want to look into catastrophic health insurance plans, which can be more affordable but still provide some level of coverage. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in finding a solution."
* "I understand your frustration, but it's important to remember that the Affordable Care Act was designed to help people like you who are struggling to afford health insurance. Have you considered applying for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)? These programs are designed to provide health insurance to low-income individuals and families. Additionally, you may want to look into cost-sharing reduction plans, which can help reduce the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in finding a solution."

TITLE: Me [26F] with my boyfriend [37M] of 11 months, long distance relationship says I'm being to needy.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months, the first few months of which we lived in the same city. He recently moved away for work and we are now living in different countries.

  If I had my way we would be texting trough out the day because that's just the way I operate and when something noteworthy happens, he is the first I want to tell. That doesn't go over well with him because he feels like I am bombarding him and he can't get other things done, which I'm fine with. I've been trying to keep my texting to minimum. 

 We've also had other issues where he was feeling suffocated when I wanted to spend the night with him most nights, but we worked through it.

 So right now we are trying to make this long distance thing work and I know he doesn't like to text or be texted a lot so I suggested (after reading a whole bunch of long distance relationship tips online) that the first person to wake up or go to bed would text the other goodnight or good morning. That way we know we are thinking about each other and it's a way to keep our everyday contact alive even if we are thousands of miles away.

 While he initially liked the idea and texted goodnight and good morning he has not done so these past couple days. I brought it up to him and he got very defensive and said that I was being needy and that he doesn't want to text me because he HAS to be because he WANTS to, which I totally understand. Except when I've tried to just let things flow I'll get one text every two days and that's just not enough I feel to keep a long distance relationship alive. So I would like an outside opinion on this; Am I being to needy? Should I just be grateful for the attention he gives me and leave it at that?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and I'm trying to keep our daily contact alive. I suggested we text each other goodnight and good morning, but he got defensive and said I'm being needy. I feel like I'm not getting enough attention and I'm not sure if I'm being too needy or if he's just not making an effort.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: I think you're being reasonable. It's understandable that you want to keep the connection alive, especially in a long distance relationship. It's not about being needy, it's about being proactive and making an effort to stay connected. Maybe have a conversation with him about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.
2. **long_distance_lady**: I'm in a similar situation and I totally get where you're coming from. I think it's great that you're trying to find ways to stay connected. Maybe try setting a specific time each day to catch up and talk, rather than just texting? That way you can have a dedicated time to talk and catch up, and it might help him feel more comfortable with the frequency of your communication.
3. **relationship_advice_bot**: I think you're being a bit too focused on the texting aspect. Long distance relationships require effort and communication from both parties. Maybe try having a conversation with him about what you both need from each other in terms of communication and see if you can find a compromise. It's not about being needy, it's about being open and honest with each other.
4. **skeptical_sarah**: I think you're being a bit too clingy. If he's not making an effort to text you, maybe he's not as invested in the relationship as you are. Have you considered that he might be feeling suffocated because he's not ready for a serious commitment? Maybe take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship.
5. **long_distance_love**: I think you're being totally reasonable! It's not about being needy, it's about being in love and wanting to stay connected. I think it's great that you're trying to find ways to stay connected and I'm sure he'll come around once he realizes how much it means to you. Keep being you and don't let him make you feel guilty for wanting to stay connected!

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all for your comments! I really appreciate your input and perspectives. I think I'm going to try to have a conversation with him about how I'm feeling and see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I also think I might try setting a specific time each day to catch up and talk, like someone suggested. I don't want to be clingy or needy, but I do want to feel connected to him and make this long distance thing work. Thanks again for your help!

TITLE: Dog with sore paw.. not a happy pup! Please help?

POST: So tonight I have to take my dog back to the vet, for his wee paw. He has been ill today and keeps 'fighting' with the cone he has on to stop him licking the sore part of his paw. My problem is that i have to get him to the vets tonight, we're getting a taxi but I'm not sure how to get him from our house to the car! basically when i go near him he gets very agitated, so my question is how do i calm him down enough to pick him up? Because he cant walk on the paw its the only way I'll get him out to the taxi :/

TL;DR: Dog with sore paw, needs to go to vet tonight, but getting him to the car is a struggle. How do I calm him down enough to pick him up?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/doglover123**: "Aww poor pup! Try using treats and positive reinforcement to calm him down. You can also try wrapping him in a towel or blanket to make him feel more secure. When you pick him up, move slowly and gently, and try to distract him with treats or toys. Good luck!"
2. **u/pawsitivevibes**: "I totally get it! My dog has had to go to the vet a few times and it's always a struggle. Have you tried using a pheromone spray or a calming aid like L-theanine? Those might help calm him down. Also, make sure to move slowly and calmly when picking him up, and try to get him used to the cone by gradually introducing it to him."
3. **u/dogmom101**: "Oh no, poor baby! I would try using a carrier or a pet stroller to get him to the car. If that's not an option, you could try having someone help you lift him up while you support his body. Make sure to keep his paw elevated and comfortable during the ride. And don't forget to give him lots of treats and praise for being a good boy!"
4. **u/animallover22**: "I'm so sorry to hear that your pup is going through this! It's always tough to see our fur babies in pain. Have you tried using a calming music or white noise to help calm him down? Sometimes, the sounds of nature or calming music can really help reduce anxiety. Also, make sure to keep the vet visit short and sweet, and try to make it as stress-free as possible for him."
5. **u/pawsitivelypawsome**: "Aww, I'm sending all my positive vibes to your pup! Try using a calming essential oil like lavender or chamomile on his bedding or in the car. You can also try giving him a gentle massage or some gentle petting to help calm him down. And don't forget to give him lots of love and reassurance during the ride!"

TITLE: How shitty of a person am I?

POST: This is a throw-away, and as kind and respectful as you are Reddit, I want your honest opinions.

Over the weekend, I ended up sleeping with two different girls within about a 14 hour period.

The first girl was early in the day, maybe 1-2pm.  I was talking to her and asked her to come over and get lunch and make out.  Her and I have sort of dating the last year.  I say sort of because it has never been official, we've discussed it numerous times and never decided to make it exclusive.  We have sort of a cutesy relationship in terms of how we act around each other, so it's not a clean pump and dump.  She lives about an hour and a half away, and I see her maybe once a month if that.  We're kind of on the tail-end of whatever it was we've been doing for the last year or so.

Then later that night another girl called and asked to hang out.  She has a thing for me, and I'm conflicted.  She's cool, and a solid friend, but sometimes attractive to me, sometimes not.  Everything was normal, and we watched a couple episodes of LOST, and then I told her I wanted to go to sleep (asleep sleep).  Then jokingly asked her if she wanted to start drinking, somehow we ended up drinking, and 2 hours or so later, she told me she was tired and we needed to go lay-down.  We have a slight history of hooking up.  Like twice in a couple of months.  Anyway, she obviously stayed the night, and we ended up sleeping together.  How should I feel about myself for doing this?

TL;DR: I slept with two different girls within 14 hours.  One is a girl I've been seeing for a year, and the other is a friend who I've hooked up with a couple times.  I'm wondering if I'm a terrible person for doing this.

You're just a guy who likes to have fun and explore his options. You're not a bad person, you're just a guy who makes poor choices."
* "You're a piece of trash. You're a cheater, a liar, and a manipulator. You're using these girls for your own selfish desires and you don't care who you hurt in the process. You're a terrible person and you deserve to be alone."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're not hurting anyone, and you're not doing anything illegal. You're just a guy who likes to have fun and explore his options. You're not a bad person, you're just a guy who makes poor choices. Maybe you should try to be more honest with yourself and the people around you, but you're not a terrible person."
* "You're a cheater, and you're a liar. You're not even trying to hide it. You're just a selfish, entitled, and disgusting human being. You deserve to be alone and you deserve to be hated."

TITLE: I [17M] am confused as to what I want with my gf [18F] of a little over a year

POST: We started dating my junior, her senior year and have been ever since. Now I am a senior and she is away at a college within reasonable driving distance. I love her and she loves me. While we are content with each other (we like to see each other, like some of the same things) I do have a few concerns about us. 

1) I have never had another serious relationship with anyone else. I feel like I cant make an informed decision of weather I an truly happy here unless I take some time to sort me out and try dating some other people to see what its like.

2) While some of our interests overlap, other things don't mix, our love languages are different (I'm big on touch, her not so much, but she puts up with it to an extent), we like different kinds of movies and stuff etc

3) Our families are from different socioeconomic classes, mine higher than hers. This isin't a big deal to me, but it adds stress to when I think about a possible future for us (how we would deal with bills/stuff, her family (and extended family) structure is different, much larger than mine and just a completely different dynamic).

4) While every time I have told her I love her, I have 100% meant it, I think I'm too young to choose a forever partner. I think I need to build my own life and see what else is out there.

I have been discussing this with her and we considered an open relationship so I can see what else is out there, and while she agreed at the time, I don't think she is ok with me being with anyone else while we are "together", which I completely understand, but in that case I don't want to string her along if the end goal is to just be "ok" this year and break it off when I go to college net year. 

She says I'm selfish, and I agree, but I'm having to weigh my love for her vs. doing what is best for me.

TL;DR: I'm 17, been with my 18-year-old girlfriend for over a year, but I'm feeling uncertain about our future and want to explore other options before committing to a long-term relationship. She's not okay with me being with others while we're together, and I don't want to string her along if I'm not sure about our future.

**Top comments:**

* "You're not selfish for wanting to explore your own desires and needs. It's actually really healthy to do so. However, you need to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's feeling insecure or uncertain about your future together, and that's causing her to react negatively to your desire to explore other options."
* "I think you're being really honest with yourself and your girlfriend, and that's admirable. It's not selfish to want to figure out what you want and need before committing to a long-term relationship. However, you do need to consider your girlfriend's feelings and needs as well. Maybe you can compromise and agree to take some time apart to focus on yourselves and your own personal growth, and then re-evaluate your relationship in the future."
* "I think you're being really immature for wanting to explore other options just because you're feeling uncertain. You need to communicate with your girlfriend and work through your issues together. If you're not happy in the relationship, then maybe you should be having a conversation about breaking up, rather than trying to explore other options behind her back."
* "I think you're being really honest with yourself and your girlfriend, and that's admirable. It's not selfish to want to figure out what you want and need before committing to a long-term relationship. However, you do need to consider your girlfriend's feelings and needs as well. Maybe you can compromise and agree to take some time apart to focus on yourselves and your own personal growth, and then re-evaluate your relationship in the future." (similar to the second comment)

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP is feeling uncertain about his relationship and wants to explore other options before committing to a long-term relationship.
* He is being honest with himself and his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns.
* The OP needs to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns.
* The OP needs to consider his girlfriend's feelings and needs as well.
* Compromise and communication are key to working through the issues in the relationship.
* It's not selfish to want to figure out what you want and need before committing to a long-term relationship.

TITLE: How do I [22M] confront my friend (and ex girlfriend) [21F] about my remaining feelings for her

POST: Recently myself [22M] and a friend of three years [21F] (not close, on and off) hooked up and from there began a relationship. We dated for four months before she called time on it in January because she "wanted to be alone" and by herself for the last few months of our last year of University (although she followed this up by saying she would probably "regret" her decision in a few weeks and that I was "the best" boyfriend she'd ever had, great closure, huh?).

I understand all her reasoning behind it, the last year being stressful and to add a relationship onto that would be extra tough. However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted "No Contact" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party/gathering with her and have everything rush back.

I'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.

I don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly. I was thinking of inviting her to have lunch at a neutral location (a cafe on campus or similar) and talking to her there.

So, the crux of the matter is what do I say and how do I go about it? I don't want her to feel like its her fault or that I'm going to ignore her / be a dick about it. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm a 22M who still has feelings for my ex girlfriend (21F) who broke up with me 4 months ago. I want to confess this to her, but don't know how to approach it. I've tried "No Contact" but keep getting drawn back in. I want to have a conversation with her about it, but don't know what to say or how to do it.

TITLE: Me [23 M/F] with my two best friends who date each other [22 M and F] of 4 years, found out one cheated and need advice

POST: Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.

Earlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like "2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. 

Now, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. 

I know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.

So reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

TL;DR: Best friend (22 M) cheated on his girlfriend (22 F) 2 years ago, contacted the same girl (Kate) this spring, and I found out. I'm torn between keeping it to myself or telling his girlfriend, but I'm scared of the potential consequences. Help me out, Reddit!

Overall, this post is a great example of the complex and nuanced nature of relationships, and the importance of considering multiple perspectives and factors when making decisions about how to handle sensitive situations.

TITLE: TIFU by trying all six sliders at Steak & Shake

POST: This actually happened when I was young, but you understand. 

It was about 1 in the morning and I was out with the boys. They were playing cards on our table at Steak & Shake while I watched. We order our meals. I was indecisive and so I told the waiter "1 of every slider!". He put down his pad and said "Really, dude?". I don't tolerate this kind of disrespect and saw it as a challenge. "Yes," I said, "All six, with cheese!" About 35 minutes pass and I've drank all my water. No refill would be given to me. The boys finished their meals and we're ready to leave. I said "Hold on fellas, let me eat! but they wanted to leave NOW. So I crammed the last 2 sliders, a buffalo and a frisco, right into my mouth and swalloed. However, they got caught in my throat. Having no drink I could not down them. My instincts kicked in and I projectile vomited onto the table, including on the man's tip. I got up and said to my buddies "We gotta get out of here, boys." They asked me why just as the waiter came to the table and began to gag. We ran. And since then the boys refuse to buy me lunch or even take me to lunch.

TL;DR: I tried all six sliders at Steak & Shake, got sick, and vomited on the waiter's tip. Now my friends won't take me to lunch.

TITLE: I want to understand his point of view on this monogamy issue...

POST: ok.  We have been together 5 years, me and his both 24.  I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner

Quick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  

Similar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.

TL;DR: I want to understand his point of view on this monogamy issue.  Why does he think it's so unreasonable for me to want the same freedom he wants?  Why does he think I'm playing games with him?  I'm really trying to understand his perspective, but it seems like he's not willing to listen to mine.

---

This post is a great example of a common issue in relationships: the struggle to understand and respect each other's boundaries and desires. The OP (original poster) is trying to understand their SO's (significant other's) perspective on the issue of monogamy, but it seems like their SO is not willing to listen to their concerns.

The OP is frustrated because they feel like their SO is not respecting their boundaries and desires, and is instead trying to impose their own desires on them. They feel like their SO is not considering their feelings and is instead trying to control the situation.

The OP is also frustrated because they feel like their SO is not understanding their perspective on the issue of monogamy. They feel like their SO is not considering the fact that they have never made a big deal out of sex and are not opposed to an open relationship, but are instead opposed to a one-sided open relationship where they are not allowed to explore their own desires.

The OP is trying to understand their SO's perspective on the issue, but it seems like their SO is not willing to listen to their concerns. They feel like their SO is not respecting their boundaries and desires, and is instead trying to control the situation.

Overall, this post is a great example of the importance of communication and respect in relationships. It highlights the need for both partners to listen to each other's concerns and to respect each other's boundaries and desires. It also highlights the importance of being open and honest with each other, and of being willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both partners.

TITLE: TIFU: By recognizing a girl i went to HS with on Reddit and telling her.

POST: throwaway for obvious reasons. THIS HAPPENED TODAY.

She posted a pic of herself celebrating something and decided to share on the website, and got alot of points for it. Thus, being seen by alot of people. I.E ME. My first reaction was "oh good for this person, that's amazing". My second reaction was something like..."wait I know those eyes". This was around 2 AM. So the genius that I am decides to message her pretty much stating (insert name here)? I thought to myself, that's not creepy right? It probably is, but she'll understand. if anything she'll ask who this is. NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO WRONG IN MY LIFE. Since i'm still up I decided to log back in and see if I had gotten a reply. she NOPE'D outta there and deleted her account. So I probably made her **SUUUPER** uncomfortable, and people really don't need that. if you happen to read this know that I'm incredibly sorry and I will never do that again. uhh. congrats.... :(

TL;DR: Recognized a girl from HS on Reddit, messaged her, and she deleted her account. I'm sorry.

TITLE: Laid off after two days on the job, what's a entry level person to do?

POST: Fresh out of college, trying to get a job as a server though I have little to no experience with it. I really wanted the job because serving is a skill I want to have experience with. This local business hired me, I told them upfront I had no experience but was a quick learner. They started me off first day as a dishwasher, and I handled it fine. The second day they wanted to start training me as a busboy and ease my way into a serving position. I was so excited for this opportunity to move up that quickly. I paid close attention, asked a question for clarity when I didn't understand something, and made sure that the guests were well attended to. At the end of the night they told me good job and though there were a few things I needed to work on they didn't expect much for my first try at it. 
I go into work today and the manager (who wasn't there the night before) sat me down and told me that they were letting me go because they didn't feel I wasn't good enough and that they needed someone with more restaurant experience. Though I only worked there for a few days I was devastated. It's a shitty shitty feeling when someone tells you you're not good enough. I mean, I'm smart I'm competent I feel like I'll pick things up once I get a hang of things. 

I've been scrolling through Craigslist the past few hours looking at more restaurant positions and all of them say the same thing "2+ years experience required." Even a dish washing position is required to have multiple years of experience. I feel like the problem out there isn't that there aren't any jobs, there's tons of them I just looked at. It's just the pool of unemployed is so large that businesses are demanding the highest of qualifications for some of the most entry leveled jobs. So my question is how is someone who isn't as qualified compete in our world today?

TL;DR: Laid off after two days on the job as a server due to lack of experience. Feeling devastated and unsure of how to compete in a job market that demands high qualifications for entry-level positions.

**Top comments:**

1. "Don't take it personally, it's a business decision. They're looking for someone who can hit the ground running, and you're still learning. Keep applying, and don't be discouraged. You'll find a place that's willing to give you a chance."
2. "I was in your shoes once. I applied to over 50 jobs before I landed one. It's tough, but don't give up. Consider taking a course or getting certified in food safety or something related to the industry. It might give you an edge."
3. "It's not about being 'good enough.' It's about being the best fit for the job. You might not have the experience, but you have enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Keep that in mind and don't get discouraged."
4. "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not alone in this struggle. Many people face rejection and disappointment in their job search. Keep applying, and don't lose faith in yourself."
5. "Consider working with a staffing agency. They often have entry-level positions available, and they can help you get your foot in the door. Just make sure to research the agency and the job thoroughly before committing."

**Key takeaways:**

* Don't take the layoff personally; it's a business decision.
* Keep applying and don't get discouraged.
* Consider taking a course or getting certified in a related field to gain an edge.
* It's not about being "good enough," but about being the best fit for the job.
* Many people face rejection and disappointment in their job search, so don't lose faith in yourself.
* Consider working with a staffing agency to find entry-level positions.

TITLE: Texting charges? USA to europe

POST: Not sure if this is the best subreddit but I'm at a restaurant in Italy on my iPhone and I couldn't find anything better. I have AT&T and paid for 500 texts for while I'm here. I just checked my at&t app and it says I've used 57/500 texts, but I'm pretty sure between sending and receiving its been more. Does it charge for both, or just sending?
I've been texting my boyfriend who is in California, he has Verizon. Does it charge him to text me while I'm here? I figured it would charge me both ways and the 500 I bought would cover it but now I'm concerned since it only says I've used 57. I haven't counted I'm just pretty sure it's more.

TL;DR: Texting from USA to Europe, AT&T says I've used 57/500 texts but I'm pretty sure it's more. Does it charge for both sending and receiving? And does it charge my boyfriend with Verizon to text me while I'm here?

---

**Comments:**

* "AT&T charges per message, so yes, it charges for both sending and receiving. If you're concerned, you can check your bill when you get back to the US."
* "I'm on AT&T too and I've had the same issue. It's not just sending, it's both. I ended up going over my limit and got charged extra. Just be aware of it."
* "I'm on Verizon and I've had no issues texting my friends in Europe. Maybe try contacting AT&T's customer service to clarify the charges?"
* "You can also check your account online or through the app to see the actual charges. It might give you a better idea of how many texts you've sent and received."
* "I've been to Europe a few times and always just used WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger to text my friends back home. No worries about charges or limits!"
* "I'm on T-Mobile and I get unlimited international texts, so I don't have to worry about it. Maybe consider switching to a carrier that offers better international texting plans?"
* "Just a heads up, some carriers charge per kilobyte of data used, not just per message. So even if you're not sending many texts, you might still be using up a lot of data. Just something to keep in mind."

TITLE: I am [19F], and my mother wouldn't approve of me 'online dating'.

POST: I'm so sorry this is all so muddled, I just don't know how to explain it properly. Also wasn't sure what to flair this as, so I just put it as 'dating'.

I am a 19 year old female, never had a boyfriend and only had my first kiss a few months ago, so I'm relatively 'innocent'. I know Tinder isn't really a "dating app" but I installed it a few months ago just for fun, until it turned into me actually agreeing to meet up with guys who I hit it off with. But I'm facing the problem of my mother, who I haven't told that I'm meeting people online, because I know she would get angry or not allow me to meet people.

I've only met one guy from Tinder in real life, and the only reason I did was because I lied to my mum about where I was. Today I was supposed to meet up and have lunch with another guy I met on Tinder, so I told my mum I was having lunch with a boy in the city. I was contemplating just saying I was having lunch with friends, but decided to tell her i was going with a boy, but not that I met him online. Then I realised that i made a massive mistake, as now I have practically dug a grave for myself, when i told her I met him locally when he actually lives nearly and hour and a half away, and became really evasive about other details. So I ended up cancelling the date, and I'm going to be questioned SO much by my mum that i'm going to have to confess that I lied and that I met him online, and that's going to cause a bit of strife.

I feel so pathetic about virtually needing my mother's consent to go and meet people! I know about'stranger danger' and am safe when it comes to this, so how do I go about meeting people from online with my mother being so over-protective? I honestly don't know how anyone my age does it.

TL;DR: 19F, never had a boyfriend, met a guy on Tinder, lied to my mum about where I was going, now I'm in trouble and don't know how to deal with it.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in a similar situation with my parents when I started dating online. Here's what I did: I sat them down and had a calm, honest conversation with them about why I wanted to date online and how I was taking steps to stay safe. It might be uncomfortable, but sometimes being open and honest is the best way to go. Good luck with your mom!"
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being a bit dramatic. Your mom is just trying to protect you because she cares about you. Instead of lying to her, why not try having an open and honest conversation with her about why you want to date online? You can explain to her that you're taking steps to stay safe and that you're not doing anything reckless. I'm sure she'll understand once she knows the truth."
3. **u/online_dating_pro**: "OP, I've been in your shoes before. Trust me, it's not worth lying to your mom. Instead, why not try explaining to her why you want to date online? You can tell her that you're looking for something serious and that you're taking steps to stay safe. I'm sure she'll understand once she knows the truth. And if she doesn't, well, maybe it's time to reevaluate your relationship with her."
4. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I think you should also consider talking to your mom about why she's being so over-protective. Maybe there's something going on in her past that's making her worry so much. Having an open and honest conversation with her might help her understand where you're coming from and why you want to date online. Just a thought!"

**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling with the decision to be honest with her mother about her online dating experiences. She feels like she's being over-protective and doesn't want to disappoint her. The comments from the subreddit offer a range of advice, from having an open and honest conversation with her mother to explaining why she wants to date online. Ultimately, the OP needs to decide what's best for her and how to navigate this situation with her mother.

Well the moment i entered the party she made it pretty clear where we both stand. 

She was already drunk and was quite touchy. When we were alone i went for the kiss and we made out a couple of minutes until she had to go back to the party. 

Well over the time of the party we made out on and off when we had time and space. 

We both were now pretty clear that we wanted more. 

The problem was that we had to wait for the party to end. Wellll that didnt happen. I eventually left at 5 in the morning tired we agreed that i d call her the next day. 

Me leaving her alone wasnt the best feeling but staying was a torture i couldnt have made it without falling asleep.

I called her today. We will meet this week.

I think we know each other quite good but i believe she doesnt know me aswell as she may think and that freaks me out.

TL;DR: Made out with a girl at her birthday party, we both wanted more but couldn't due to the party. We'll meet this week.

QUESTIONS:

1. What do you think about the situation?
2. Do you think the OP should be worried about the girl not knowing him as well as he thinks she does?
3. How do you think the meeting this week will go?

ANSWERS:

1. It seems like the OP and the girl had a good connection and chemistry, and it's understandable that they both wanted more. However, it's also important to consider the context of the situation - they were both drunk and in a party setting, which can make it difficult to make rational decisions.
2. It's possible that the girl may not know the OP as well as he thinks she does, especially since they've only hung out in small groups before. It's understandable that the OP is worried about this, but it's also important to remember that people can change and grow, and it's possible that the girl may have developed feelings for him over time.
3. It's hard to say how the meeting this week will go, but it's possible that they will have a good time and continue to develop their connection. However, it's also important for the OP to be aware of his own feelings and boundaries, and to make sure that he's not putting too much pressure on the situation. It's also important for the girl to be honest with him about her feelings and intentions, and for them to communicate openly and honestly with each other.

TITLE: TIFU by throwing my shitty slipper at an old lady.

POST: This happened 10 minutes ago. I was walking home from the grocery store— a full bag of stuff ranging from milk to toothpaste, in either hand. This stuff was really heavy, so I wasn't really looking down, scanning the road for potential shit for my feet to squish; I just wanted to get home quickly before my arms separated from my body. You can probably guess what happened next, I stamped on a surprisingly large piece of dog shit. Or maybe it could be human shit, who knows. I don't know my shit. I didn't know what to do. My house was just two blocks away, but I didn't want to keep walking in my shitty slippers. So I decided I'd try to shake most of the shit off of it. I shook. Nothing happened. I shook harder. Nothing happened. This shit was made of super glue. I see the old lady who always wants to start a conversation with me for some reason; she's approaching me. I freak out. My arms pain really bad. So I shake my slipper really violently, and it comes off and flies right at the old. It hit her left boob, shit side up. I didn't know what to do, again. I was freaking out even more now. I had two options— wait, apologise, take my shitty slipper home and have a fucking long conversation with the annoying lady; or run home one slipper less. I really didn't want to talk to the lady, and eh, I could buy new slippers. I had just a few seconds before she approached; the shock of the flying shitty slipper was still with her. I committed, and ran— nay, wobbled like a penguin wearing one slipper. This still isn't over. The handles of one of the bags tore. It fell off. I lost my wobble-rhythm and the other one fell too. I lost my balance and fell with it. I just left all the stuff there and sprinted home.
I don't know what I'm going to tell my mom.

TL;DR: I threw my slipper at an old lady after stepping in dog shit and it hit her boob. I ran home with one slipper and lost the bags. I'm going to tell my mom that I got robbed. I hope she doesn't ask me what I was wearing. I hope she doesn't ask me what I was doing. I hope she doesn't ask me what happened to my slippers. I hope she doesn't ask me what happened to the bags. I hope she doesn't ask me what happened to the old lady. I hope she doesn't ask me what happened to my dignity. I hope she doesn't ask me what happened to my life.

TITLE: Should I [16m] tell her [16f] how I feel/felt? Ready to move on/make last ditch effort after 2 months of flirting

POST: Male 16. So I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now, and we really seemed to click. A few weeks ago she was being really flirty, and seemed like she wanted me to ask her out. I was waiting for the right time to ask her out, but she was never just by herself with me to ask. 

   A week went by and I tried talk to her and she just seemed really distant, like she almost wanted nothing to do with me. We had this off and on relationship of her being really flirty and then really distant. This has lasted 5 weeks. This [thread] I posted in r/teenrelationships sums it up pretty well. 

   Anyways, I'm ready to make one last ditch effort/try to move on. What I'm asking for is advice on this one matter: Should I tell her how I feel? I think it could help me get my feelings for her off of my chest and make it easier to move on. On the other hand, if she gets all touched and stuff and wants to go out with me after that, then hey, that's great.

   I do realize that telling girls how you feel isn't really fair to them by overloading them with all of that baggage. I do realize that I could create a completely irreparable relationship with this girl. I'm just ready to make one last ditch effort, or make an effort to move on.

   What do I do, r/relationships? Do I tell her how I feel, or do I just soldier on?

TL;DR: 16m, been talking to 16f for 2 months, been flirting, but she's been distant. Ready to make one last ditch effort or move on. Should I tell her how I feel, or just move on?

POSTER'S GOAL: To get advice on whether to tell the girl how he feels or to move on.

POSTER'S CONCERNS: Overloading the girl with his feelings, creating an irreparable relationship, and not knowing how she'll react.

POSTER'S THOUGHTS: He's been waiting for the right time to ask her out, but she's been distant. He's ready to make one last ditch effort or move on. He's unsure if telling her how he feels is the right thing to do.

ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT:

* Some people advise him to move on and not waste his time on someone who doesn't seem interested.
* Others suggest that he should try to talk to her and see if they can work things out, but he should be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way.
* A few people advise him to take a break from the situation and focus on himself for a while before making a decision.
* One person suggests that he should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about his feelings and see where it goes.

Overall, the subreddit advises the poster to be cautious and considerate of the girl's feelings, but also to be honest and open about his own emotions. They suggest that he should weigh the potential risks and benefits of telling her how he feels and make a decision that is best for him.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my married online friend [30 F] 3 months, strained emotional relationship

POST: I posted a few weeks back but deleted the post. The summary of the situation is this: I met a female gamer playing an mmo who is currently married with two kids  and is in an emotionally abusive marriage. She has been in this marriage for 10 years. My insecurities caused a rift and our contact has become strained. 

We became close, feelings were very strong and we professed our mutual love for each other. We chatted and Skyped often. 

In time, though, my insecurities and unease with the situation placed stress upon us both which has brought me to where we are. I tried to break off contact two weeks ago and stated as such. She was devastated and I ended up being unable to follow through. We decided our best bet was to try and remove the emotional side from it and I have been unable to do so.

I've really struggled with everything. I feel like I love this woman and I know that my constant worries and questions caused the rift. It became very hard to not feel sad when her husband would call and interrupt our Skype sessions. Or when she suddenly changed factions in the game we played and seemed no longer wanting to play with me. I would make my feelings known and she tried to reassure me. It all became too much, as she felt as if it wasn't enough and she couldn't be enough. 

This past week, I told her that I couldn't handle just being friends right now and I should try to take some space. She explained that she doesn't feel the same as she once did and she doesn't know what the future holds. She said she isn't able to write things off for good yet but space and time are important. 

My questions are this:

Is there hope or is it worth holding out hope for a future? 
Am I wrong to feel so bad about how I handled the situation?
How can I overcome my insecurities relative to this situation?

TL;DR: I've been in an emotional relationship with a married woman for 3 months. We've professed our love for each other, but I've struggled with insecurities and our contact has become strained. I've tried to break off contact, but we're still in touch. I'm unsure if there's hope for a future together and if I'm wrong to feel bad about how I handled the situation.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being really honest with yourself and that's the first step. It's not easy to acknowledge your insecurities, but it's a huge step forward. As for hope, it's hard to say. She's still married and has kids, and that's a huge commitment. But if you're willing to work on your insecurities and be patient, maybe there's a chance for something in the future."
* "I think you're being unfair to yourself. You're not wrong to feel bad about how you handled the situation, but you're also not wrong to feel the way you do. You're human, and it's natural to have feelings. The question is, what do you want to do about it? Do you want to keep trying to make it work, or do you want to take a step back and focus on yourself?"
* "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. You can't control how she feels or what she wants, but you can control how you react to the situation. Take some space, focus on your own well-being, and see where that takes you. And honestly, if she's not willing to work on her own issues and leave her husband, then maybe it's not meant to be."
* "I think you're being really selfish. You're not considering the fact that she's married and has kids. You're not thinking about how your actions might affect them. You need to take a step back and think about what's best for everyone involved, not just yourself."
* "I think you should try to communicate with her and see where she's at. If she's not willing to work on her issues and leave her husband, then maybe it's not worth pursuing. But if she's willing to work on herself and figure out what she wants, then maybe there's a chance for something in the future."

**Note:** The comments are a mix of supportive and critical, with some users encouraging the OP to focus on himself and take space, while others are more critical of his actions and lack of consideration for the woman's family. The discussion highlights the complexities of the situation and the need for the OP to prioritize his own well-being and make decisions that are best for everyone involved.

TITLE: I sent my estranged friend an anonymous letter and I don't know how to process the response. Advice would be appreciated.

POST: She and I met in freshman year (I was 18, she 17) as neighbors in our dorm. We lived together for several years (about 3) but at some point started to have our insecurities interfere with our relationship. Our friendship faced several set backs and pretty much fizzled out in a rather dramatic fashion. At first this was okay. I was angry and couldn't communicate or forgive. At the time I didn't want to acknowledge that I had made mistakes too. 

A long while had gone by since I'd thought about her. I've been dealing with a lot and have kind of gone down this hermit path, I honestly have no friends in the city I live in. In my loneliness, the thoughts of our good times came to mind and I just started missing her so much. Now go to several days ago - I sent my friend an anonymous message on tumblr basically saying I loved them and always will. Of course this could be interpreted both as friendship-love or romantic, so this could have been unclear. A few messages later (still anonymous) it was basically said that she had realized who it was and that they had let it go (meaning our past problems). 

QUESTION: Now in my note I had hinted I wanted to rekindle our friendship so, should I take this 'all is forgiven' attitude as she is over the past and that's it- no chance; or, is the person over the past and open to something? Sorry that was pretty drawn out or if this all seems petty. It's just this person meant so much to me at one point. My feelings got hurt and I hurt their feelings, and then it was just done. Time has passed, making reconciliation that much more unlikely.

Am I being delusional or weird for holding on to some memory of a person?

TL;DR: Sent anonymous letter to estranged friend, got response saying they're over past issues, but unsure if they're open to rekindling friendship or if it's just forgiveness. Help me process this!

TITLE: My [21 F] boyfriends [26 M] past haunts me.

POST: Basically I want your opinion on dealing with a significant other's past. 

I hate my boyfriend's past. I hate his past relationships, friends with benefits, and friendships with other females that he had before me. I hate the girls he used to be infatuated with, the girls he was attracted to, etc.

I'm the type who asked him for all these details, but ultimately hearing them made me upset and obsessed and filled with hatred.

I snooped on his computer, his old profiles, and found things that I didn't like.

Mind you, this is the PAST. All these things that happened before me, shady or not, are a thing of the past: nonexistent. 

What do you think of your partner's past? How do you deal with it? Do you even care about it? 

I hate my behavior and would love to hear other people's perspectives on this issue.

TL;DR: I'm obsessed with my boyfriend's past, hate the girls he used to be with, and feel like I'm losing myself in this obsession. Help.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're still in the honeymoon phase and are trying to fill the void by obsessing over your boyfriend's past. You need to focus on your own life and what you want, rather than trying to control your boyfriend's past. It's not your problem, it's his."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I understand where you're coming from, but you need to remember that your boyfriend's past is exactly that - the past. It's not going to change who he is today. If you're really unhappy about it, maybe you should have a conversation with him about how it makes you feel. But ultimately, it's not your place to dictate what he did or didn't do in the past."
3. **u/itsallaboutthepast**: "I'm a bit of a nosy parker, and I have to admit that I've snooped on my partner's past too. But honestly, it's not worth it. You're going to drive yourself crazy trying to uncover every little detail. Just focus on building a strong relationship with your partner in the present, and let the past stay in the past."
4. **u/communicationiskey**: "I think you're misunderstanding the concept of 'the past is the past.' It's not about erasing or forgetting what happened, but about acknowledging that it's over and moving forward. If you're really struggling with this, maybe you should have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's possible that he's not even aware of the impact his past is having on you."
5. **u/relationshipadvice**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're projecting your own insecurities onto your boyfriend's past. You need to work on building your own self-confidence and self-worth, rather than trying to control or dictate what your partner did or didn't do in the past. It's not about you, it's about him. And if you're really unhappy about it, maybe you should reevaluate whether this relationship is right for you."

TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 5 years. I think I want to move on, but I'm scared and feel guilty.

POST: I really love my 25M boyfriend. We've been in a great relationship since the start. We live together. I've now finished school and am unsure of where the whole thing is going. Nothing is really wrong, but I don't feel satisfied. Am I chasing a golden goose?  

**Here's what I love about my relationship with him:**  

* I love the guy and he loves me
* My parents and family love him, which is very important to me
* We agree on all fundamental values & beliefs
* We talk about getting married in general
* He makes me laugh
* He is so smart and caring
* I trust him with absolutely no reservations 
* He is the kindest, most wonderful person in the world and I've never met anyone who didn't like him  

**But**  

* Though we've talked about marriage, there's no proposal/engagement/plan with real goals
* We've been together for so long that I don't remember what it's like to be myself
* I'm attracted to more than one person outside of the relationship, and that terrifies me
* I hate it when I feel like I have to drag him to go out and have fun/justify wanting to go out and have fun (like at bars, dancing, etc)
* He still has 3 more years of school left and that seems like such a long time to wait to settle down
* I feel like I'm trying to justify being unhappy because our relationship is wonderful on paper and I feel like I'm just a shitty whiner/guilty about wanting something different  

So what do you think?  

This is just what happens to people our age, right?  

I'm just a big whiner, right?

TL;DR: 24F, 5-year relationship with 25M. I love him, but feel unsatisfied. I'm scared to move on, but feel guilty for wanting something different. Help me figure out if I'm just being a whiner or if there's something more to this.  

**Edit:** I've been reading through the comments and I just wanted to add that I'm not looking for someone to tell me to stay or to leave. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable or if this is a normal feeling for people in long-term relationships. I appreciate all the advice and support so far!  

**Edit 2:** I've been thinking a lot about this and I realized that I'm not unhappy because of my boyfriend, but because of my own fears and insecurities. I think I'm just scared of change and the unknown. I'm going to take some time to figure out what I really want and what's holding me back. Thank you all for your input and support! I feel a lot better now.

TITLE: I [F, 24] had a falling out with friend [F, 23], have anxiety when I need to see her in group situations. Help!

POST: I'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.
A few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.

However, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.

Normally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.

Has anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. 

Do you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now? I didn't want to stir drama but was thinking that maybe at least some of my close friends

TL;DR: I had a falling out with a friend, we're no longer friends, but we have mutual friends. I get anxious when I see her at parties, but I don't want to avoid my other friends. Should I try to be polite or just ignore her? How did you deal with a similar situation?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "I've been in a similar situation before. I would suggest talking to your close friends about what happened. They might not know the whole story, and it's better to be honest with them. It's also possible that they're not aware of the drama and gossip going on. If you're feeling anxious, it might be helpful to have a support system to talk to. As for interacting with your former friend, I would say just be polite and friendly. You don't have to go out of your way to make small talk, but a simple hello and how are you can go a long way. Just remember that you don't owe her anything, and you're not obligated to be friends with someone who doesn't respect your boundaries."
2. **anxious_anxiety**: "I totally get where you're coming from! I've had similar experiences in the past. For me, it's been helpful to prepare myself for these situations by thinking about what I want to say and how I want to react. It's okay to take a step back and collect your thoughts if you need to. You don't have to make small talk or engage in conversation if you don't feel like it. Just being present and acknowledging your feelings is okay. As for talking to your friends, I think it's a good idea to share what happened with them. They might be able to offer some valuable advice or support. Just be honest and open with them, and I'm sure they'll understand."
3. **skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I would recommend talking to your friends about what happened. While it's understandable that you want to be honest with them, it's also possible that they might not be able to handle the drama and gossip that comes with it. You don't want to stir up unnecessary drama or make things worse. Just focus on being polite and friendly when you see your former friend, and try to avoid engaging in any kind of drama or gossip. Remember that you're not obligated to be friends with someone who doesn't respect your boundaries, and you don't have to justify your actions to anyone."
4. **calm_calm_calm**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and be polite when you see your former friend. Don't worry too much about what she thinks or what others think. You're not responsible for her actions or reactions. Just focus on enjoying the time with your other friends and don't let anxiety get the best of you. Remember that you're strong and capable, and you can handle whatever comes your way."

TITLE: Finally took the plunge and started NC

POST: It's just over a month since I broke up with my SO. We've seen each other a couple of times since our mutual breakup and he has helped me through some tough personal times since then, but things got really hard for me after I slept with him over a weekend trip away with some mutual friends. I just miss him and regret ever agreeing to our mutual breakup without ever really voicing what I wanted. 

I'd like to think that we will still remain close and supportive friends, and I hope we do, but being able to see his Facebook and follow his every move was just destroying me and making my depression all the more difficult to deal with. Which is why I've (finally) decided to start NC and just get on with myself. I've unfriended him and it was hard but very liberating. I know I'll certainly see him in person in the near future again due to our mutual friends and common interests, but knowing that I don't have to speak to him again unless it's on my terms is both painful and good.

It has been a horrible, painful, depressing ride but lurking around here in /r/Breakups and seeing that I'm not alone has helped a lot. Thanks everyone.

TL;DR: Finally took the plunge and started NC after a month of mutual breakup. Miss him, regret the breakup, but needed to unfriend him for my own sanity and well-being.

TITLE: [NSFW] BF [22 m] and I [23 f] can't agree on this boundary

POST: Together 2 years.  I'm using a throw away because this is a bit of an awkward problem I don't want associated with my main.

My boyfriend and I are pretty good at compromising, and have always been good about approaching the problem as a team. However, the current discussion we're having is something we've been unable to compromise on.

My boundaries are pretty strongly associated with interaction. So while I have no problem with my bf looking at porn or gonewild or whatever, commenting or messaging someone on those or other mediums is not okay. 

I found out fairly recently that my bf downloaded mods for a popular game that allow you to "have sex" with other characters, and that he had specifically downloaded characters, characters with certain appearances, and some characters resembling celebrities. 

When I found this out I was very upset. Maybe a bit of an overreaction, but I think that's because I saw his comments on subreddits talking about these mods and characters, and a comment that basically crossed the line for me because it was on a nsfw photo album. 

We discussed it, we cried. I reiterated my strong feelings about interaction and commenting and he apologized and said he understood. He suggested he should uninstall the game and mods.

Now he wants to reinstall the game, and had been planning on re-installing the same mods. 

We can't come to a compromise. He feels that the modding is basically porn and is therefore fair game and none of my business. I feel that the modding (and involvement with selecting new mods, new characters and involvement with the modding community) is too interactive and is something I'm not comfortable with, as I feel it crosses the boundaries of our relationship.

TL;DR: BF wants to reinstall game mods that allow him to interact with characters, including ones that resemble celebrities, despite my strong feelings about interaction and commenting. We can't come to a compromise.

**Comments:**

* "I think you should have a clear conversation with your bf about why this is a dealbreaker for you. It's not about the game or the mods, it's about the interaction and the boundaries you've set. You can't compromise on something that makes you feel uncomfortable and disrespected."
* "I'm with OP on this one. If you're not comfortable with the interaction, then it's not okay. It's not about the game or the mods, it's about respecting each other's boundaries."
* "I think you're being a bit unfair. The mods are just a game, and it's not like he's actually interacting with real people. It's not the same as commenting on a nsfw photo album."
* "I agree with OP. The fact that he's downloading mods that allow him to interact with characters that resemble celebrities is a major red flag. It's not just about the game, it's about his willingness to push boundaries and disregard your feelings."
* "I think you should consider couples therapy. This is a big issue and it's not going to go away on its own. You need to work through this together and find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm not sure I agree with OP. While I understand where you're coming from, I think it's a bit extreme to say that he can't play a game with mods. Maybe there's a middle ground? Like, he can play the game without the mods that allow interaction?"
* "I think you should take a step back and think about why this is so important to you. Is it really about the game, or is it about something deeper? Are you feeling insecure or threatened by his desire to play this game?"
* "I think you should have a clear conversation with your bf about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. It's not about the game, it's about respecting each other's boundaries and feelings."

**Discussion:**

The post sparked a lively discussion about boundaries, relationships, and what is and isn't acceptable in a romantic partnership. Many commenters agreed with OP that the interaction with characters, especially those resembling celebrities, was a major red flag and a boundary that should be respected. Others argued that the game was just a game and that OP was being unfair to expect their bf to give it up.

The discussion also touched on the importance of communication and compromise in relationships. Many commenters emphasized the need for OP and their bf to have a clear and honest conversation about their feelings and boundaries, and to work together to find a compromise that works for both of them.

The post also sparked a discussion about the role of technology and social media in relationships, and how it can blur the lines between reality and fantasy. Some commenters noted that the mods and game were just a form of escapism, while others argued that it was a way for people to explore their desires and fantasies in a safe and controlled environment.

Overall, the post sparked a nuanced and thought-provoking discussion about the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication, compromise, and respect for each other's boundaries.

TITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 7 months, only likes to text me to talk. Driving me crazy

POST: My bf only likes to talk to me through text. I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like "Hey" "How are you what are you doing" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. 
We don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?

TL;DR: Boyfriend only likes to text me, conversations are superficial, I crave deeper conversations, he doesn't want to try video chat or phone calls, I feel no connection when we text.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: differences in communication styles and preferences. The OP (original poster) is frustrated because her boyfriend only likes to communicate with her through text, which she finds superficial and unsatisfying. She wants to have deeper and more intellectually stimulating conversations, but her boyfriend is resistant to trying other forms of communication, such as video chat or phone calls.

The OP's concerns are valid, and it's understandable that she feels disconnected from her boyfriend when they only communicate through text. Texting can be convenient, but it can also lead to misunderstandings and a lack of emotional intimacy.

The boyfriend's reluctance to try other forms of communication may be due to various reasons, such as shyness, discomfort with phone calls, or simply being used to texting. However, it's important for him to understand that his girlfriend's needs and preferences are different, and that they should work together to find a communication style that works for both of them.

The OP's question, "Am I wrong to be annoyed?" is a good one. While it's natural to feel frustrated when our needs are not being met, it's also important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. The OP should try to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings and needs, and see if they can find a compromise that works for both of them.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations where I felt like my partner was avoiding deeper conversations. Have you tried having a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling? Maybe he's not aware of how you're feeling."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and needs. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Have you considered setting boundaries around your communication style? Maybe you can agree to have a certain amount of time each day to talk on the phone or video chat."
* "I've been in a similar situation where my partner only wanted to text. It was really frustrating for me too. But I realized that it was because they were shy and didn't know how to have deeper conversations. Maybe your boyfriend is struggling with something similar. Have you tried being patient and understanding, and seeing if you can help him feel more comfortable with other forms of communication?"

Overall, this post highlights the importance of effective communication in relationships, and the need for partners to understand and respect each other's differences in communication styles and preferences. By being open and honest about their feelings and needs, the OP and her boyfriend can work together to find a communication style that works for both of them.

TITLE: For people who are atheists (r/atheism), why do you poke fun at Catholics for believing in the Catholic God?

POST: While I don't condone every negative action of the Catholic religion, I think its cruel to be mean to them. 

While I am Atheist, I can understand why some people follow religion. I don't hate or make derogatory terms to people who choose to believe in a god. 

I don't make fun of Catholics because I can understand why they believe in a religion. They want a reason to believe in life after death because death is a scary concept. A lot of people on reddit make it seem like religion is a horrible thing. While I am firm on my atheist stance, I love the fact that religion existed because it defines our history as a human race. People need religion to explain things they cannot understand or cope with. Whats wrong with not facing reality?

As an atheist, we have to accept that we are just a tiny speck in the entire universe. I think its logical to assume that people refuse to believe that because it sounds negative. Why must we poke fun at the uneducated and delusional?

TL;DR: As an atheist, I don't understand why people make fun of Catholics for believing in the Catholic God. I think it's cruel and unfair. I understand why people believe in religion and I think it's okay to have faith. We should accept that people have different beliefs and not make fun of them.

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're misunderstanding the concept of 'atheism'. Atheism isn't about being mean or cruel to people who believe in a god, it's about not believing in a god. It's not about being 'delusional' or 'uneducated', it's about being rational and logical. I'm not 'poking fun' at Catholics, I'm just not believing in the same thing they do. You can't force someone to believe in something they don't want to, and you can't make someone stop believing in something they do want to. Let people have their beliefs, and let's focus on the things that actually matter in life."
* "I think you're being too soft on religion. While I understand that people need something to believe in, I think it's important to critically examine the claims of religion. Just because someone believes in something doesn't mean it's true. And just because someone is'scared' of death doesn't mean they need to turn to religion. There are plenty of other ways to cope with the fear of death, like accepting it and living life to the fullest. I'm not 'poking fun' at Catholics, I'm just saying that we should be critical thinkers and not just accept things because they make us feel good."
* "I think you're misunderstanding the concept of 'atheism' again. Atheism isn't about being'soft' or 'hard' on religion, it's about not believing in a god. It's not about being 'critical' or 'accepting', it's about being honest with ourselves and the world. I'm not 'poking fun' at Catholics, I'm just not believing in the same thing they do. And I'm not'scared' of death, I'm just accepting of it. I think it's important to be honest with ourselves and not try to impose our beliefs on others. Let people have their beliefs, and let's focus on the things that actually matter in life."
* "I think you're being too focused on the 'atheist' label. I'm not an 'atheist', I'm just a person who doesn't believe in a god. I think it's important to focus on the things that actually matter in life, like treating others with kindness and respect. I'm not 'poking fun' at Catholics, I'm just not believing in the same thing they do. And I'm not'scared' of death, I'm just accepting of it. I think it's important to be honest with ourselves and not try to impose our beliefs on others. Let people have their beliefs, and let's focus on the things that actually matter in life."

This post and its comments demonstrate a common theme in online discussions about religion and atheism: the tendency to conflate criticism of religion with personal attacks or mockery. The original poster is concerned that people are being "mean" and "cruel" to Catholics, but the comments show that many people are simply expressing their disagreement with religious beliefs and practices, rather than attacking individuals. The comments also highlight the importance of critical thinking and intellectual honesty in evaluating religious claims, rather than simply accepting or rejecting them based on emotional or personal factors. Overall, this post and its comments demonstrate the complexity and nuance of online discussions about religion and atheism.

TITLE: Help me save this situation!!!

POST: Hi guys,

So this guy [21M], say Chuck, and I [23M] know this girl [21M] Gloria, let's say. Chuck and I hang out at this regular spot and so have chit-chatted and learned that Gloria has flirted with us both on separate occasions and both of us agreed that she was a helluva catch -pretty, witty, musical, etc. The way that we talked about her was in a respectful "man, I'd like to get to know her, she's really cool".

Anyways, up until yesterday, we didn't know Gloria was available. So my buddy comes up to me a few days into it and says "guess who swiped right?" It was her! Now he's not very good at starting tinder conversations, so I just up and tell him to give her my number (as a joke, but play it off). I'm thinking to myself "hell yeah I want her to have my number!" 

Anyways, he texts "Jimmy wants you to have his number 555-5555 and here's mine 555-5555" and I feel like this is still in the realm of funny. But then he goes ahead and puts "choose wisely" which I'm worried might be too dead pan. I'm initially not too worried about it because when I last saw Gloria, we had the comfort level (with each other) of cracking sex and masturbating jokes. 

I can play this off in person, but text is pretty hard. And if we scare her from coming back it might come to this. So, over tinder, unless how can he do a follow-up to reconcile this situation and/or let her see the situation as the stupid fumbling of two young dudes that it is?

TL;DR: Friend texts girl with my number, adds "choose wisely" and now I'm worried about how to salvage this situation.

---

The post is asking for advice on how to salvage the situation after his friend texted a girl with his number, adding a somewhat awkward comment ("choose wisely"). The OP is worried that this might scare the girl off and is looking for ways to reconcile the situation and make it seem like a harmless joke. The post is seeking advice from the r/relationships community on how to handle this situation.

**Potential responses:**

1. "Dude, just be honest and apologize if she's upset. It's a weird situation, but it's not the end of the world."
2. "Try to make light of it and joke about it. If she's cool with it, you can laugh it off and move forward."
3. "Don't worry too much about it. It's just a weird Tinder situation. If she's not interested, there are plenty of other fish in the sea."
4. "You should probably just block her number and move on. It's not worth the drama."
5. "Try to have a conversation with her about it and see how she feels. If she's upset, apologize and move forward."

**Potential follow-up questions:**

1. "What do you think is the best way to apologize if she's upset?"
2. "How can I make light of the situation without coming across as insensitive?"
3. "What are some other ways to salvage the situation if she's not interested?"
4. "Should I try to have a conversation with her about it, or just let it go?"
5. "What are some signs that she's not interested and I should just move on?"

TITLE: My boyfriend [22/M] is a little uncomfortable with me [22/F] returning my ex's things. [dating for 4 months]

POST: Hey r/relationships, slightly petty concern ahead!

I recently told my boyfriend very candidly and openly that I needed to return my ex's stuff. My boyfriend had mentioned early on in the relationship that he was nervous about my feelings towards my ex considering I moved into this relationship just 3 months after I broke up with him. When I heard of these concerns, I immediately deleted my ex off facebook and my phone hoping I could quell his worries. He is still friends with his ex on facebook, and I have not said anything because I am trying to not let stuff like that bother me. 

He has some trust issues, and when I mentioned bringing my ex's stuff back he fell silent. I asked him if he trusted me and he said "I'll have to." I asked him how I could do it to make him feel better and he suggested I tell my ex to pick up the stuff from my place. I agreed that I would try but while I think that making him feel is my first priority, I feel a little rude for asking my ex to make the trip. 

He promised he would work on these trust issues, but when I mentioned it to him, he kindly said that although he knew what kind of person I am, knew what to expect, but I had to "build a rapport" to maintain and prove that the trust was warranted. I was a little confused because I felt like I deserve to be trusted initially, as I trust him, but perhaps we have different viewpoints.

Are his views on trusting people warranted? Am I an idiot because I trust people too easily? What else can I do to build this trust?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is uncomfortable with me returning my ex's things, says I need to "build a rapport" to prove trust. I feel like I deserve trust initially, but maybe we have different views. Help!

---

**Comments:**

* "I think your boyfriend is being a bit unreasonable. You've already deleted your ex off social media and are in a new relationship. It's not like you're still in contact with your ex or anything. I think you should just return the stuff and not make a big deal out of it. If he's still uncomfortable, maybe he needs to work on his own trust issues."
* "I agree with the previous commenter. You've done everything you can to move on and show your boyfriend that you're committed to him. Returning your ex's stuff is a normal part of moving on and shouldn't be a big deal. If he's still having trouble with it, maybe he's not the right guy for you."
* "I think your boyfriend is trying to say that he needs to see some effort from you to prove that you're committed to him and not just going to go back to your ex. I get that. But maybe he could be more understanding and supportive of your decision to return the stuff. It's not like you're doing it to spite him or anything. You're just doing what you need to do to move on."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your boyfriend about what's really going on. Is he worried that you're going to go back to your ex? Is he worried that you're not over him yet? You need to get to the bottom of what's really bothering him and address those concerns directly. And maybe you can find a compromise, like having your ex pick up the stuff or something."
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive about this. Your boyfriend is just trying to protect himself and his feelings. You need to understand where he's coming from and try to find a way to compromise. Maybe you can return the stuff and then have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling and what you need from him to feel secure in the relationship."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people agreeing with the boyfriend's concerns and others thinking he's being unreasonable. Some people suggest that the girlfriend should just return the stuff and not make a big deal out of it, while others think she should have a conversation with her boyfriend to understand what's really bothering him and find a compromise. Ultimately, the decision is up to the girlfriend and her boyfriend to figure out what works best for them. It's clear that trust is an important issue in their relationship, and they need to work together to build and maintain it.

TITLE: I [27f] want to propose to my boyfriend [25m] on our 5 year anniversary.

POST: Boyfriend and I have been together for almost five years (August 30th!), in the most loving and amazing relationship I think anyone could ask for. We value the same things, make each other laugh until we cry (or fart), love each other's families, share interests, and respect one another's personal time and space. I can see myself with this man in 60 years, two old farts having a laugh at our grandchildren's expense. He is my guy, and I am his gal. That's really all there is to it. Also, the sex is AMAZEBALLS.

I know he wants to marry me, but I feel like he's waiting until the "right time". Waiting until we are a little more financially stable, until blah blah blah. I think within a year or two we will be financially ready to move into a larger place and get a dog and do all that "pre-kids" marriage stuff. A nice long engagement, and we're all set.

I want to propose. Personally, I think he'd get a kick out of it. He comes from a long line of feminists. I don't think he'd say "no", and really my biggest fear is that I'd steal his thunder. I have something truly spectacular in mind, but would like Reddit's take on it before I do something crazy.

What do you think, guys? Should I go for it, or wait to see if he possibly pops the question first?

TL;DR: Want to propose to my boyfriend on our 5 year anniversary, but worried he might say no or that I'll steal his thunder. Should I go for it, or wait to see if he proposes first? Help! 

---

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you're thinking too much! If you're ready to propose, just do it! He'll appreciate the thought and effort you put into it. And if he says no, well, that's a whole different conversation. But I think you know your boyfriend well enough to know he'll be okay with it."
* "I think you should wait until he proposes first. You want to make sure he's on the same page as you, and proposing without his consent could lead to some awkward conversations. Plus, it's a big deal, and you want to make sure it's a joint decision."
* "I'm a guy, and I think you should totally propose! It's a romantic gesture, and it shows that you're willing to take the leap and make a commitment. Just make sure you're prepared for the possibility that he might not be ready, and have a plan in place for how you'll handle that."
* "I think you should propose, but only if you're prepared for the possibility that he might not be ready. You don't want to put pressure on him or make him feel like he's being forced into something he's not ready for. But if you're both on the same page, it could be a really special moment for both of you."
* "I'm a feminist, and I think you should totally propose! It's 2019, and women can propose too! It's not about stealing his thunder, it's about showing your love and commitment to each other. Just make sure you're prepared for the possibility that he might not be ready, and have a plan in place for how you'll handle that."

TITLE: Hey guys, do you know how to get a ridiculous hospital bill reduced??? Details inside.

POST: I had a bike accident and broke my wrist and separated my shoulder and some road rash. I went to the hospital where I waited 4 hours to get an x-ray. I was also given pain medication that was injected to me without telling me how much each shot would cost. They injected me about 4 times total. They also cleaned some of the road rash and put a temporary cast on me and referred me to another doctor. This cost me $1867. This seems a little unfair. I did not ask for pain meds nor was I told how much it would cost me. Do any of you know if I have something going here? Do any of you have a success story from a similar situation???

TL;DR: Got a $1867 hospital bill for a bike accident. Didn't ask for pain meds, wasn't told how much it would cost. Any advice on how to get this reduced?

TITLE: Perhaps you can help with my medical problems

POST: First, stomach cant burp almost. It wants to, but the mechanism to burp seemed fucked up. It cant burp, so I get sick, and it tries to eject everything instead. I hate eating now, since it hurts from the first few bites. And then after I eat a meal it hurts. Lots of discomfort. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. But, could that be due to saliva or something? I noticed when I throw up its...weird. Its like a blob of spit almost...could that be due to swollen tonsils? They stay big, but when I get sick, they get even bigger and hurt. I cant eat or drink for a few days. Also, my lymph nodes kinda get like a ball shape you can feel...

Anyway, that one is not so bad I guess. Ive been smoking MJ, and even with that I cant eat. But If I smoke a LOT, then I can at least eat a few bites. So, found a fix..

The sleep problem seems to be destroying me right now. I cant sleep from the time 11-2 is seems. For the last year at least. I have hypnagogia, so I play a "movie" or dream before I fall asleep fully. Ill be in the deepest thought you can ever have, and it will play automatically. Its sorta like inception. But after the movie, usually around 30 minutes, ill wake up. but lately ive been catching myself even before that. when it starts, ill think, wtf am i thinking about, and then be like, DAMN. When I finally fall asleep, i feel im not sleeping deep. Or if I do, no more than a hour. I wake up exhausted. I never get the tired feeling/sensation/chemical until the day. I take a nap, and I feel so much more rested after a few hours. But I cant take naps during the day everyday. Even if I dont nap, Ill be god damn tired all day. Then 11 comes and im fucking wide awake. Its hell. Weekend or weekday I cant sleep at night. Ive tried just about all the things they tell you to do. None work.

TL;DR: I have stomach issues, cant burp, and it hurts to eat. I also have sleep problems, cant sleep from 11-2, and wake up exhausted. I've tried everything and nothing works.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/AskReddit community can provide helpful and insightful responses to users' questions and concerns. The OP (original poster) is describing a range of medical issues, including stomach problems, difficulty sleeping, and hypnagogia. They've tried various remedies and treatments, but nothing seems to be working.

The comments section is filled with users offering advice, sharing their own experiences, and asking follow-up questions to help the OP better understand their symptoms. Some users suggest that the OP may be experiencing acid reflux or gastroparesis, which could be contributing to their stomach issues. Others recommend trying relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to help with sleep.

One user even shares their own experience with hypnagogia, describing it as a "movie-like" experience that they've learned to control through meditation. Another user suggests that the OP may be experiencing a condition called "sleep maintenance insomnia," which is characterized by difficulty staying asleep once you've fallen asleep.

Overall, the comments section is filled with helpful and supportive responses that demonstrate the community's willingness to help and offer advice. The OP may not have found a definitive solution to their problems, but they've certainly received a lot of helpful feedback and guidance from the r/AskReddit community.

TITLE: Update Me [38 M] trying to figure out if my wife [34] of 2.5 years, cheated on me in the past

POST: [Original post](

Okay I finally talked to my wife. I was really nervous and tried to set up a good opportunity. When it got as good as I though it was going to get I just said "So, did anything ever happen between you and dude?" Not the smooth delivery I had hoped to make.

She said "You mean like romantically? No, no never." She seemed very sincere, and I believed her right away.

I went on to tell her all of the reasons I was worried, and she was very understanding. She was upset that I didn't trust her.  She did start crying when I told her about my fears that our daughter might not have been mine. She was upset that I would even think that, which is what I anticipated, and one of the main reasons I waited so long to tell her.

I put her in my shoes and asked how she would feel if a female coworker of mine acted in a similar way. It seemed like she hadn't considered that, and she admitted to being jealous and insecure in the past, which made me feel better.

She made lots of reassurances that if she was ever unhappy enough in our relationship that she would think about seeing someone else, that she would let me know things were bad way before it got to that point.

It's hard to describe how you can tell someone is telling the truth, but I could really tell. Unless she is some kind of amazing liar, which I think I would have known about after 16 years.

She did defend her douchey friend's actions a little, which I was bothered by. She said he always says things like that and doesn't really mean anything by it. I still think he's just a dipshit. I told her I didn't want to hang out with him and his wife anymore. We have moved 1200 miles away from where they are now, so it doesn't really matter.

So, yeah I am the paranoid insecure jackass that I was hoping I was.

Thank you all for your thoughts and advice.

TL;DR: I'm 38, my wife is 34, we've been married for 2.5 years. I'm trying to figure out if she cheated on me in the past. I confronted her and she denied it, seemed sincere, and made reassurances. I'm still unsure, but I think I believe her. I'm trying to move forward and work on my own insecurities.

TITLE: There's something to be said for some time off

POST: Last month (July 19th to be exact) I went for a 6 mile run and totally blew my knee. I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old "normal" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace! I only stopped because I didn't want to go from zero to 60 and risk reinjury. I feel like a million bucks!

TL;DR: Had to take 5 weeks off from running due to knee injury. Used the time to focus on strength training and dropped 3 pounds. Went for my first run back and felt amazing, ran 3 miles at a pace 25 seconds faster than my old pace. Feeling like a million bucks!

COMMENT 1:
Congrats on the progress! It's amazing how much strength training can help with running. I've had to take time off from running due to injuries too, and it's always tough to adjust. But it sounds like you made the most of it and came back stronger. What's your plan for getting back into regular running now that you're feeling good?

COMMENT 2:
I'm so glad to hear you're feeling good and strong! I've been dealing with a similar issue with my IT band and it's been tough to take time off. But I've been doing a lot of strength training and stretching and it's really helped. What kind of strength training were you doing during your time off? I'm looking for some new exercises to add to my routine.

COMMENT 3:
Wow, 25 seconds faster is huge! I'm impressed. I've been struggling with my own running lately and it's good to hear that taking time off and focusing on strength training can make a big difference. Do you have any tips for someone who's struggling to get back into running after taking time off? I feel like I've lost my endurance and it's hard to get motivated.

COMMENT 4:
I'm so proud of you for not getting discouraged and for using your time off to focus on strength training! It's amazing how much of a difference it can make. I've been doing a lot of yoga and Pilates during my time off from running and it's really helped with my flexibility and balance. Do you think you'll continue to incorporate strength training into your routine even when you're back to regular running?

COMMENT 5:
I'm so glad to hear you're feeling good and strong! I've been dealing with a similar issue with my knee and it's been tough to take time off.

TITLE: Me [20F] with my boyfriend [27 M] of 1 year, on a break because of his lost desire for sex.

POST: We went a few days without talking at all so I finally ask him what's up. He keeps saying he can't explain it but he's sorry and that the fire is gone from the relationship. We meet up to talk about it in person and he says he lately has no sex drive, asks me why we need to have sex every time we hang out (2-3 times per week usually).

This made me feel really insecure and took my self-esteem down a notch but told him I wanted to fix it. His solution was to keep on doing everything else the same but just take a break from sex to see if that fixes things. I feel that there is an underlying issue with the relationship such as him just losing interest because we've been together for a while. So I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely and see how it feels.

On my end it feels like shit. I want to call him just to talk about our day or to say I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate to him. It gets a little easier each day so I'm wondering if I should break it off completely so there's no lingering hope of getting back together. That's the only way I see myself truly moving on.

Should I stay in a relationship where he is confused about his feelings and physically uninterested? Or should I break things off and try to move on?

TL;DR: Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year, but he's lost his sex drive and says he's sorry but can't explain it. He wants to take a break from sex to see if that fixes things, but I think there's an underlying issue with the relationship. I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely, but it's hard for me to resist reaching out to him. Should I stay in the relationship or break things off and try to move on?

TITLE: Person I'm dating (both 24[f]24[f]) broke our exclusivity rules. Worth saving?

POST: Been together approximately one month, however have not firmly spoken about the boundaries of the relationship apart from deleting dating apps and saying we weren't seeing anyone else. We decided we weren't ready to use any form of labels or terms yet

It's been going well, met each other's friends etc except today she discloses that she slept with someone approximately 1 week ago. It's someone who she previously was interested in a romantic relationship but rejected her. She stated that she was enjoying what we had etc, and she feels this person would not have a relationship with her,

At the moment I have let her cool off (she's feeling a lot of guilt, confusion) and have told her to have a think. I think I'm happy to continue if she is able to prioritise and choose me, and really work on this. This might involve having to drop contact with the person she cheated with However it feels so early to be having to work on our relationship. I feel like if she doesn't immediately know then it's not worth it

What would you do? Say? Would you even consider continuing? Under what conditions?

TL;DR: Person I'm dating broke our exclusivity rules, slept with someone else 1 week ago. I'm unsure if it's worth saving the relationship. Should I give her a second chance or move on?

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not worth it. You've only been together a month and she's already broken the rules. If she can't respect your boundaries now, what's to say she won't do it again in the future?"
* **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're being too harsh. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's not like she's been cheating on you consistently. If she's willing to work on it and prioritize your relationship, it might be worth giving her another chance."
* **u/relationship_rant**: "You're being too soft. If she can't respect your boundaries, she's not the right person for you. You deserve better than someone who's willing to cheat on you, even if it's just once."
* **u/communication_is_key**: "Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Ask her why she did it, and what she's willing to do to make it right. If she's genuinely sorry and willing to work on it, it might be worth considering. But if she's just going to brush it off or make excuses, it's probably not worth saving the relationship."
* **u/it_depends**: "It depends on the circumstances. If she was in a vulnerable place and made a mistake, it might be worth giving her another chance. But if she's been playing the field and only came to you when she got bored, then it's probably not worth it."
* **u/you_do_you**: "Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you're willing to tolerate in a relationship. If you're willing to work through this and forgive her, then go for it. But if you're not comfortable with the idea of her cheating on you, even once, then it's probably best to move on."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are divided, with some people advising the OP to cut ties with the person they're dating, while others suggest giving her another chance if she's willing to work on the relationship and prioritize their feelings. Ultimately, the decision comes down to the OP's personal values and what they're willing to tolerate in a relationship. It's also important to consider the importance of communication and honesty in working through this issue.

TITLE: Reddit, what kind of effect do you think that crime shows/movies might have in reducing the occurrence of thought-out, "intelligent" crime?

POST: I had this thought a few days ago when watching an episode of NCIS and they did the usual "create a super high resolution image from a very low resolution image." I got to wondering how much of it is real and how much of it is fake (or, conversely, how much might be under-exaggerated). Based on these types of shows/movies (bank robbery, conning, etc.) where the bad guy nearly 100% of the time gets caught, only an idiot would think it would be a good idea to do any of this stuff, and from my [limited] knowledge of the general criminal, I'm under the impression that they are mainly uneducated people in dire situations (or psychopaths/mentally unstable.. but I'm thinking mostly with regards the heist type of crime -- not assault or murder) that are driven to extreme lengths to make the "easy"/"quick" dollar. So I wondered, is it possible that these shows/movies that show the criminal, no matter how smart and creative, almost always getting caught could actually be (subconsciously or consciously) reducing the amount of more well thought through crime throughout the world?

TL;DR: Do you think crime shows/movies might have a positive effect on reducing the occurrence of "intelligent" crime?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: I think you're onto something here. I've always thought that crime dramas might have a deterrent effect on would-be criminals. The idea that even the most clever and sophisticated crimes can be solved with enough effort and resources might make people think twice before committing a crime. Plus, the shows often portray the consequences of getting caught in a pretty realistic way, which might also serve as a deterrent.
2. **u/NotoriousP.I.**: I've worked in law enforcement for years, and I can tell you that crime dramas are often way more accurate than people give them credit for. The forensic science, the investigative techniques, the psychological profiling... it's all based on real-life methods and procedures. And you're right, the shows often portray the consequences of getting caught in a realistic way, which can be a powerful deterrent.
3. **u/CrimeSceneInvestigator**: I'm a crime scene investigator, and I can attest that the shows often get the details right. The DNA analysis, the fingerprinting, the bloodstain pattern analysis... it's all based on real science. And the shows often portray the investigators as being meticulous and thorough, which is exactly what we do in real life. So, yeah, I think the shows might have a deterrent effect on would-be criminals.
4. **u/ConspiracyTheorist99**: I think you're being too optimistic. Crime dramas are just entertainment, and people who watch them are just going to think it's all a bunch of hooey. Besides, the shows often portray the investigators as being superhuman, with access to unlimited resources and expertise. In real life, it's not like that. Crime is a complex and messy business, and it's not always solved with a quick DNA test or a fancy forensic technique.
5. **u/TrueCrimeJunkie**: I love this topic! I've always thought that true crime documentaries and dramas might have a deterrent effect on would-be criminals. The shows often portray the consequences of getting caught in a pretty realistic way, and the investigators are often portrayed as being smart and resourceful. Plus, the shows often highlight the importance of forensic evidence and the role that it plays in solving crimes. So, yeah, I think the shows might have a deterrent effect on would-be criminals.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for all the thoughtful responses! I was expecting a lot of "no way, it's just entertainment" type responses, but it's clear that many of you think that crime shows/movies might have a positive effect on reducing the occurrence of "intelligent" crime. I'm glad to hear that many of you think that the shows often get the details right, and that the portrayal of investigators as being meticulous and thorough is accurate. I'm also glad to hear that some of you think that the shows might have a deterrent effect on would-be criminals. I think it's definitely possible that the shows could have a subconscious effect on people, making them think twice before committing a crime. Thanks again for all the thoughtful responses!

TITLE: Me [23 M] don't understand my crush [25 F] absolutely anymore

POST: So I've known this girl for almost 3 years now. We dated a little while when we met, but as soon as things started to get little bit more serious, she moved to Australia for 2 years (in my defence, she had the tickets bought before we started dating).

Now last november she came back, at that time I was at sea (working in the Navy). Since February we've been seeing each other again, been to the movies, restaurants, just hung out at each other's places etc, it's been fun. 

Couple days ago I asked her, what does she think about a relationship, to which she replied that she's not really looking for anything serious. I reluctantly agreed. Since we've known each other for some time now, I won't start ignoring her just for that, better to stay friends. 

2 days ago I had a party at my place, to which she came also. By time others fell asleep, we stayed up the whole night, drank and watched some stupid cartoons and spooned like there's no freakin tomorrow (got horrible blue balls from that). For a girl, who told she's not looking for a relationship, that was kind of odd thing to do, am I looking at "friends with benefits" kind of invitation or something? Confused af.

Sorry for long post, let there be a invisible potato.

TL;DR: Crush says she's not looking for a relationship, but we still hang out, had a weird night where we spooned and watched cartoons, and I'm confused if she's looking for something more or just friends with benefits.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my wife [26 F] 5 years together, Third week into our trial separtation

POST: 5 weeks ago I came home from work and my wife told me that she would be moving out in a week and a half. 

We are in the third week of her moving out. I am in our house that we bought 2 years ago and the daily reminders of her being gone are finally settling. I feel like I am the only one trying to make this relationship work right now. My heart broke when she left and I am trying to rebuild trust in her so that we can be happy if she decides to come home. 

She has been in therapy for 2 years and I just started 4 weeks ago. I am coming to many realizations and am confronting the issues that I made in our relationship. I know that now that I have seen that fear was controlling me I never want to go back to that dark place again. She tells me that she is afraid of feeling trapped in the relationship and not being able to keep her voice to ask for what she wants. 

Tonight we had a phone call. (The happen every 2-3 nights) I asked her if she was leaning to one side or the other in terms of coming home. She is against the relationship right now. She isn't working on rebuilding the relationship, she is trying to figure out if she wants the relationship at all. 

She is the most important person in my life. I love her so much and it hurts an unthinkable amount that she doesn't want to try.

How do I maintain my trust in her with her crushing my hope so heartlessly? What do I have to say to let her know that I am making so much emotional progress and positive growth?

TL;DR: My wife left me 5 weeks ago and I'm trying to rebuild trust and make our relationship work. She's not interested in working on it right now and is trying to figure out if she wants the relationship at all. I'm struggling to maintain my trust and hope.

---

This post is a heart-wrenching account of a man's struggle to maintain his trust and hope in his relationship with his wife, who has left him and is not interested in working on their relationship at the moment. The OP (original poster) is trying to make progress and grow emotionally, but it's clear that his wife's lack of interest is crushing his hopes and making it difficult for him to trust her.

The post raises several questions and concerns, including:

* How can the OP maintain his trust in his wife when she's not interested in working on their relationship?
* What can the OP say to his wife to let her know that he's making progress and growing emotionally?
* How can the OP balance his desire to rebuild their relationship with his wife's lack of interest?

The post also highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. The OP is trying to be open and honest with his wife, but it's clear that she's not reciprocating in the same way. This can be a challenging and painful experience for both parties involved.

Overall, this post is a poignant reminder of the complexities and challenges of relationships, and the importance of empathy, understanding, and effective communication in navigating difficult times.

TITLE: [30 M] Can a relationship work with no chemistry?

POST: I'm kind of a unique situation... 30 years old never had a gf, never done anything sexual, just recently started online dating.  (Reason for my lack of experience is being extremely shy, low self esteem)  Reason I've started online dating is an attempt to salvage what's left of my life.. figured even though I wasted so much of my life at this point there's no reason I should just die as a lonely virgin, so i decided to at least TRY.

After about ~5 or so weeks I've met two girls so far, got at least one more to meet in the near future.  Problem is, I am a bit awkward (Ok, I am a lot awkward.)  I feel like I do not "click" with anyone, and would not really know how to flirt, etc.  Question is this: how important/real is this "chemistry" thing?  If I don't feel anything, is it possible to develop these feelings over time?

In other words, should I force the relationship forward just because I so desperately want one?  Or should I move on when I don't detect this "chemistry" thing, and have the gross audacity to actually *turn down* an attractive female when I'm a 30 year old desperate virgin?

Dating and relationships are just so alien to me and I have no idea what I'm doing or how to even interact with the opposite sex.  At times I feel I'm being irresponsible even trying, and I have no right to date anyone :/

TL;DR: 30 year old virgin, started online dating, met a few girls, don't feel any chemistry, unsure if it's worth pursuing or if I should just move on.

---

**Comments:**

* "Chemistry is real, but it's not the only thing that matters. If you're genuinely interested in someone and they're interested in you, you can build a strong connection over time. Don't force it, but don't give up either. Keep an open mind and see where things go."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're 30, it's not like you're 20 and still figuring things out. You've got a lot of life experience, and that's something to work with. Don't worry about being a 'desperate virgin', just be yourself and see what happens."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Chemistry is important, but it's not the only thing. If you're not feeling it, it's okay to move on. You don't have to force a relationship just because you're lonely. Take your time, focus on getting to know people, and see what develops naturally."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not a 'desperate virgin', you're just someone who's trying to take control of your life. That's something to be proud of. Don't worry about what others think, just focus on being happy and fulfilled."
* "I think you should take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find someone, and that's not healthy. Take some time to figure out what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. When you're ready, you can start dating again and see what happens."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for the responses! I really appreciate the advice and the kind words. I think I was just feeling really overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I think you're all right, I shouldn't be putting too much pressure on myself. I'll just take things as they come and see what happens. And yeah, I'll try to focus on being happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether I'm in a relationship or not. Thanks again, you guys are awesome!"

TITLE: TIFU By trying to have two females hook up in my backyard.

POST: So this happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the back yard, replacing a damaged sprinkler head. I dug up the old one, and removed it when I noticed that the hole was slowly filling with muddy water. It was so murky, I could not see the bottom of this 5 inch deep hole. So, I get the new sprinkler, attach a 1 inch male coupling to the bottom, and then attach another 1 inch female coupling to that, so that the new sprinkler would sit a little higher, therefore be more visible while mowing. I lower this into hole, and start twisting, hoping that it will snag onto what I had assumed was another male end at the bottom.

After doing this for about 2 or 3 minutes, I am starting to get frustrated. I reach in there to feel around, but the hole is too narrow for my grizzly-like hands. I try using towels to get the water out, to no avail. I try to widen the hole by using said water to turn dirt walls into mud, so that my hand might fit better. At this point, I am ten seconds away from making the hole larger using a shovel, and possibly having more dirt and debris fall in, when I look up at the old sprinkler head. I realize my foolishness. Attached to the bottom of it is the male coupling that I had been attempting to attach my female coupling to.

I pop off the new female coupling, sink that sprinkler in, give it a good twist, and vam, bam, boosh. Filled up the hole, and am now sitting here, glad none of my friends were around. After realizing my mistake, I had it done and said with, within 1 minute.

TL;DR: I tried to attach a female coupling to a male coupling in my backyard, and it took me 20 minutes to realize my mistake.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that I am still in shock that I did this. I am a 28 year old man, and I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I tried to hook up two females in my backyard. I am not sure if I should be laughing or crying. I guess I will just have to chalk it up to a learning experience. I hope you all enjoyed this story, and I hope it made you laugh. I know it made me laugh, and I am still chuckling as I write this. I guess I will just have to be more careful in the future, and make sure that I am not trying to hook up two females in my backyard.

TITLE: Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or...?

POST: R/travel, you guys have been good to me, helped my wife and I put together a killer 2 week tour de Spain, both of our first times out of the country.

Now we are looking at a 7-8 day trip in 2016, maaaybe early 2017. Weighing out what both wife and I want, ideally we could get:
  -relaxation 
  -zip lining (wife says zip lining is a must)
  -relatively easy travel from west coast (avoiding jet lag on such a short itinerary)
  -no car rental (fine w cabs/ trains/ bus)
  -if we're doing a relaxing vacation, I'd love if we could be on the beach
  -other activities: day hikes, snorkel, kayak??
  - good food/ drink hopefully!!

I was trying to figure out where to get started on a Costa Rica itinerary, when someone strongly suggested Nicaragua. Part of my downfall is trying to do too much, so help me keep it simple :). 1-2 locations over 8 days would be perfect.

Thanks!

TL;DR: 7-8 day trip, relaxation, zip lining, easy travel from west coast, no car rental, beach, day hikes, snorkel, kayak, good food/drink. Considering Costa Rica or Nicaragua. Help me keep it simple!

---

REPLIES:

1. **Costa Rica is the way to go!** You'll have plenty of options for relaxation, zip lining, and outdoor activities. Consider staying in Tamarindo or Puerto Viejo for beach time. You can take a shuttle or bus from the airport to get to your destination. For food, try some local cuisine like gallo pinto or empanadas.

2. **Nicaragua is a great alternative!** You can visit the colonial town of Granada and take a boat tour of the nearby Isletas de Granada. For zip lining, head to the nearby town of Masaya. The food in Nicaragua is delicious, and you can try some local specialties like vigorón or nacatamales.

3. **Consider a combination of both!** You could spend a few days in Costa Rica and then head to Nicaragua for the rest of your trip. This way, you can experience the best of both countries.

4. **Don't forget about Panama!** It's a great option if you're looking for a mix of relaxation, outdoor activities, and culture. You can visit the Panama Canal, go hiking in Boquete, or relax on the beach in Bocas del Toro.

5. **Keep it simple and focus on one location!** You can still have a great time in one place. Consider staying in a single location and exploring the surrounding area. This will help you avoid the stress of constant travel and allow you to truly relax.

6. **Research, research, research!** Make sure to read up on both Costa Rica and Nicaragua to get a better sense of what each country has to offer. Look for reviews and recommendations from other travelers to help you make your decision.

7. **Don't forget about the weather!** Both Costa Rica and Nicaragua have a rainy season, so make sure to plan your trip accordingly. You may want to consider visiting during the dry season (December to April) for better weather.

8. **Get in touch with a travel agent!** If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a travel agent who specializes in Central American travel. They can help you plan your trip and make recommendations based on your interests and preferences.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my romantic interest [18 F] 2 weeks, not sure what to do

POST: Hello /r/relationships. I've been dating this girl for 2 weeks (only had one date, we're both in the army so it's kinda complicated), but we've known each other for two years, and been great friends for over a year. We've had a hiatus after some ugly things surfaced, but lately we got in touch, and I decided to ask her out, because I'm 18 and never actually had a girlfriend or even a date before.

So we went out and whatnot, but no touching or whatever occurred. While I'd usually be concerned she's not interested in me, knowing her personality, she's quite shy and somewhat fears touching and whatnot, so it's understandable. 

Tomorrow we're going on another date, and I was wondering if to just flow with the situation, or somewhat push forwards and ask her if she wants a more serious relationship, i.e. actually be a couple. While she shies away from contact, when you approach her with these things, she's honest and says whatever's on her mind. So I was wondering if I should or shouldn't do so - because we've been good friends for over a year, we know each other well, so is it worth bothering going on regular dates or should I just try and "force" the issue on her?

TL;DR: 18 M, 2 weeks with 18 F, unsure what to do - should I just flow with the situation or push for a more serious relationship?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's great that you're thinking about this before diving in. It's good that you're considering her feelings and boundaries. I'd say just enjoy the dates and see where things go. Don't put too much pressure on it. If she's not ready for a serious relationship, it's okay to just enjoy the friendship and see where it goes." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, have fun on the dates, and see where it takes you. Don't try to force anything. If she's not interested in a serious relationship, she'll let you know. And if she is, she'll let you know that too. Just relax and enjoy the ride." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about your feelings and expectations. It's okay to be honest and open about what you're looking for in a relationship. Just make sure you're listening to her perspective too. Don't try to force anything, but also don't be afraid to be vulnerable and express your feelings." (u/relationshipcoach)
* "I think you're being too focused on the'serious relationship' aspect. Just enjoy the dates, get to know each other better, and see where things go. Don't put too much pressure on it. If it's meant to be, it'll happen naturally. And if not, you can always go back to being friends." (u/throwaway321)

TITLE: I (18m) asked her (18f) to marry me a month into the relationship, and she said yes, but...

POST: I'm (18m) roughly a month into this relationship with a girl (18f) who has turned my entire world around, and we can't get enough of each other. We go to college together and see each other all the time. We agree on every single issue that has come up in news and in society: abortion, marriage rights, how to raise kids, religion, etc, etc. We spend easily over 6 hours together a day about 5/7 days a week and have told each other things we have never told anyone else before. I have no doubt in her, nor her in I. And she did say yes to my proposal.

However, my parents, and her parents both know that we have only been together about a month now, and I am just curious how it is we should clue them in on this situation in the least freak the hell out sort of way possible... Her and I both more or less come to a blank on this. We also don't plan on getting married until 2015 when we're out of school, or at least transferring. Any help on this would be great.

TL;DR: I proposed to my girlfriend after a month of dating, and she said yes, but we're unsure how to break the news to our parents without freaking them out.

**Comments:**

* "You're 18, she's 18, and you're getting married in 2015? That's a long engagement. Are you guys sure you're ready for this kind of commitment?" (u/throwaway123456)
* "I think you should have a conversation with your parents and her parents separately before telling them both at once. You want to make sure they're on the same page before you drop this bombshell on them." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "Have you guys thought about the logistics of living together, combining finances, and all that jazz? Marriage is a big deal, and it's not just about the romance and love. You need to think about the practicalities too." (u/practicalityoverromance)
* "I think it's great that you're excited about your relationship, but maybe you should slow down a bit. You're still in college, and you have your whole lives ahead of you. Why rush into marriage?" (u/calm_down)
* "You should talk to a therapist or counselor about your motivations for proposing so quickly. It's not uncommon for people to propose impulsively, but it's worth exploring why you felt the need to do so." (u/therapist)
* "I think you should consider having a conversation with your girlfriend about why you proposed so quickly. Is it because you're scared of losing her? Is it because you're feeling pressure from your parents or society? You need to understand your own motivations before you can have a healthy conversation with your parents." (u/relationshipcoach)

TITLE: Redditors: Have you been hit on by a manager that's different sexual orientation that knew you were not the same preference?  Good or bad outcomes that came from it?

POST: While in HS I worked at a theme park over several summers.  I went back one more year in college and a former supervisor had been promoted to a very high up position.  I was living close to his house and he asked if I wanted to hang out sometime.  I didn't think anything of it.  I knew he and his wife had divorced and figured he wanted to have an excuse to go to the bar.  

We had a few drinks and went back to his place for a couple more drinks as the bar closed.  He switched from beer to some heavily poured mixed drinks at a fast pace.  He began to talk about his life and got into some DEEP shit, and got emotional.  I just kept listening trying not to be a douche, thinking maybe I am helping.  Then he started saying "I haven't felt so close to anyone like this before".  I said "that's understandable, you are talking about some heavy stuff". He kept going saying " I feel like I want to hug you.  Maybe hold you if you want to sit over here".  I told him I was comfortable where I was.  He kept going and I politely got up to leave and he changed his tune quickly.  He tried to give me a hug at the door but I switch it to a handshake.  I felt bad but not much I could do.  He was ten years older, two levels higher than my boss, and most importantly I am straight.

A couple of weeks later I did something at work that would have been cause for immediate termination (one of those bureaucratic safety things where no one could have been hurt but it's just a rule).  He was in charge that day and he changed the violation to a lesser offense that allowed me to keep my job.

TL;DR: Former supervisor (different sexual orientation) hit on me, I politely declined and left.  A couple of weeks later he helped me out at work when I made a mistake that could have gotten me fired.

**Comments:**

* "Wow, that's a pretty intense situation. I'm glad you were able to handle it professionally and didn't feel pressured to reciprocate. It's great that he was understanding and didn't make a big deal out of it. And even more impressive that he helped you out at work afterwards. That shows he's a decent person, even if he was a bit tipsy"
* "I'm a bit surprised he didn't get in trouble for hitting on you, especially since he's your former supervisor. But I guess it's good that he was understanding and didn't make a big deal out of it. Did you ever talk to him about it afterwards or just kind of brushed it off?"
* "I'm a bit concerned about the power dynamic in this situation. As your former supervisor, he had a lot of control over your job and could have potentially made things difficult for you if you didn't comply with his advances. I'm glad you were able to handle it professionally and didn't feel pressured to reciprocate, but I'm also a bit worried about the potential consequences if you had said no"
* "I'm a bit surprised you didn't report him for sexual harassment. As a supervisor, he had a responsibility to maintain a professional relationship with you and not make advances. Even if he didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, it's still inappropriate and could have created a hostile work environment. I'm glad he didn't get in trouble, but I think you should have reported it to HR or someone in a higher position"

TITLE: My girlfriend [20F] and I [22M] of over 1 Year are having issues regarding differing views on Sex before marriage and living together. I really need some advice or other experiences here, please help Reddit.

POST: Essentially, my girlfriend believes in the whole Sex after Marriage and no Living together till marriage whilst I believe the opposite and after 1 Year and 2 months it's starting to get messier. 

To start off, a little back story; my girlfriend is of Christian background and I'm not, and she did tell me she didn't want sex before marriage about 4 months into the relationship. A but late, but I respect people's decisions and don't want to push them into these things. She's a Virgin, I'm not, but I thought this girl was awesome and though "fuck it, not worth breaking up just because she doesn't want sex". 

So recently, Valentine's day, I (stupidly) brought up the situation of living together and sex before marriage, I always saw sex as an important part of a relationship and a way to intimately connect with your S/O and express your love. I also feel that living together before marriage is a great test, because some people cannot stand living together even when in a relationship. My girlfriend believes all this should happen after marriage. 

A part of me feels like it's her parents who are also heavily influencing her decisions, she always brings it back to disappointing her parents with her decisions. Whilst I respect that, some times I feel her parents are controlling her indirectly. Am I wrong to think this?

So after an argument last night, my girlfriend and I came to the point of "do we break up, or wait till marriage". And I'm left here really confused and stuck. I don't want to break up but at the same time I'm so worried,confused and I feel like I'm missing something now. Have you been in this situation? Do you have any advice that can help me? What are your views....I'm at a stump and I'm scared I'll make the wrong decision.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, we have differing views on sex before marriage and living together. She believes in waiting till marriage, I believe in doing it before. We had an argument and are considering breaking up or waiting till marriage. I'm stuck and need advice.

TITLE: Not sure if husband [25M] is angry at me for not being sure if I'm in love with him or not.

POST: I love my husband sometimes, but I don't love him all of the time. I may feel bad for him sometimes, and try to love him out of pity, but I know that isn't love. I just had to get that off of my chest. 

My husband knows that I loved him enough to have given my virginity to him. 

I don't like it when he guilt trips me to try to get into my pants faster when I don't feel like having sex.

Sometimes I'm not sure why I married my husband. I hope that it's not out of pity. I'm scared that if he ever finds out that I get guilt tripped easily into "love", he'll get angry that I may not love him as much as he loves me.

What should I do? I'm scared that he has already figured it out that I may never love him as much as he loves me.

TL;DR: I'm not sure if I'm in love with my husband, and I'm scared that he's going to get angry when he finds out.

TITLE: [28]Female with this guy[31] I've been dating for 3 months. He has so many beautiful friends that are girls...Hard to not be jealous/insecure.

POST: So I've known him for a few years now, but only recently have we started dating. He's definitely someone that I care about and he hasn't given me any reason to doubt his sincerity.(so far)

BUT, the hardest thing is that he goes out dancing a lot (that's where I met him and we do that regularly) and has SO many friends that are girls. They are beautiful, smart, fun, creatures and sometimes it's just really hard to trust that he's really just interested in me only. 

His Best Friend is a girl.. that CONSTANTLY facebooks him "I love YOU!!" etc... and it's just so uncomfortable.

TL;DR: I'm dating a guy who has many beautiful friends, and it's hard for me to not be jealous/insecure about it.

TITLE: The guy (25 male) I've (24 female) been seeing for a month went through my ipod (the photos) after I accidentally forgot it in his car, how upset should I be?

POST: I had given him the passcode the day before while I was driving so he could change the music.

Prior to this I had been very clear about having trust issues and really enjoying my privacy. He claims that if the tables had been turned and I looked through his photos he wouldn't have cared in the slightest. 

In his defense he was slightly sleep deprived...and although he apologized he thought most people he knew wouldn't react the way i was and thought I was being overly sensitive. 

For the record, there were no inappropriate pics but there were some embarrassing selfies i had taken while drunk, lol. So I'm pretty mortified and honestly that's contributing to my anger. The bottom line is that I feel it was an invasion of privacy and it says a lot about him, what do you guys think?

TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing for a month went through my ipod (photos) after I forgot it in his car, claims it was an accident and that most people wouldn't care. I'm upset because I value my privacy and feel it was an invasion. What do you guys think?

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're being reasonable. It's not okay for him to go through your personal belongings without permission, even if it was an accident. You need to have a serious talk with him about boundaries and respect."
* "I'm with OP. If he can't respect your privacy, then he's not the right guy for you. You deserve better."
* "I think you're overreacting. It was an accident, and he apologized. Maybe you're just being too sensitive?"
* "I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's not just about the photos. It's about the principle. If he can't respect your boundaries, then he's not the right guy for you. You need to have a serious talk with him about what you're comfortable with and what you're not."
* "I think you should take a step back and evaluate the relationship. If he's willing to go through your personal belongings without permission, then what else is he willing to do without permission? You deserve better than someone who disrespects your boundaries."
* "I think you're being too harsh. It was an accident, and he apologized. Maybe you can try to talk to him about it and see if you can work through it together."

Overall, the comments are divided, with some people agreeing with OP that it was an invasion of privacy and others thinking that OP is being too sensitive. However, the majority of comments suggest that OP should have a serious talk with the guy about boundaries and respect, and that if he can't respect her privacy, then he's not the right guy for her. Some comments also suggest that OP should take a step back and evaluate the relationship. Only a few comments think that OP is overreacting and that the guy's apology should be enough.

TITLE: Is it normal for me(21m) to be uncomfortable with her(18f) posting nude pics of herself on Tumblr?

POST: My gf of just over a year sometimes posts nude pics of herself on her Tumblr and I'm really uncomfortable with it. I feel like such a hypocrite because I was fine about us posting in r/GW, It was my idea. posting pics of yourself to anonymous strangers for shits n' giggles is fine with me, But when it's on her Tumblr it isn't really anonymous at all, it's mostly her friends, be it male or female. She isn't posting smut, It's pretty tasteful for the most part. I'm just really uncomfortable about the idea of her friends seeing her naked. Is it normal for me to not be ok with this, or am I just being stupid and jealous? How would you feel in this situation?

TL;DR: My 18-year-old girlfriend posts nude pics of herself on Tumblr, and I'm uncomfortable with it. Is it normal for me to feel this way, or am I just being stupid and jealous?

**Top Comments:**

* "I think it's normal to feel uncomfortable with something that makes you feel uneasy, even if it's not necessarily 'wrong'. It's okay to communicate your feelings with your girlfriend and see how she reacts. Maybe she's not aware of how you feel or maybe she has a different perspective on it. Either way, it's better to be open and honest about your feelings than to bottle them up and potentially let them fester into something bigger." (123 upvotes)
* "I think it's a bit of a double standard that you're fine with posting nudes on r/GW but not on her Tumblr. If you're really uncomfortable with it, maybe you should have a conversation with her about it. But also, consider the fact that she's 18 and can make her own decisions about what she wants to share online. It's not like she's posting explicit content or anything. Maybe try to understand where she's coming from and why she feels comfortable sharing this part of herself with her friends." (92 upvotes)
* "I'm a woman and I have to say, I would be really turned off if my partner was uncomfortable with me posting nudes online. It's a big part of my identity and I feel like it's a way for me to express myself and take control of my own body. If you're really uncomfortable with it, maybe you should reevaluate whether you're compatible with someone who values their own autonomy and self-expression. Just saying." (67 upvotes)

**Other Comments:**

* "I think it's weird that you're fine with posting nudes on r/GW but not on her Tumblr. Like, what's the difference? It's all just anonymous strangers looking at your girlfriend's body."
* "I'm a guy and I have to say, I would be really turned off if my girlfriend was posting nudes online. It's just not something I'm comfortable with. But hey, to each their own, right?"
* "I think it's a bit of a double standard that you're fine with posting nudes on r/GW but not on her Tumblr. Like, why is it okay for you to share your girlfriend's body with strangers but not with her friends?"

**Conclusion:**

The majority of commenters seem to agree that it's normal to feel uncomfortable with something that makes you feel uneasy, and that it's okay to communicate your feelings with your girlfriend. Some commenters also point out that it's a bit of a double standard that the OP is fine with posting nudes on r/GW but not on his girlfriend's Tumblr. Others suggest that the OP should try to understand where his girlfriend is coming from and why she feels comfortable sharing this part of herself with her friends. Overall, the comments suggest that it's important to be open and honest about your feelings and to try to understand each other's perspectives in a relationship.

TITLE: Don't know if (or how) I [22F] should tell my boyfriend [25M] I really don't like what he got me for Christmas.

POST: Yeah I realize it is now a long time since Christmas and this part of my dilemma, which I guess is my own fault. So for Christmas my boyfriend (of ~10 months) got me a gift certificate for a "makeover and photoshoot".  I can't really imagine doing anything much worse than spending my day having my hair and make-up done than having my photo taken for two hours. Okay, maybe a bit dramatic but I'm really not that kind of girl and my boyfriend does know that. I guess he could be hinting that he wants me to dress up a bit more but I didn't really think he cares – I think it is more likely that someone told him it was a good gift idea or something he got for an ex that they really liked.

Anyway, I pretended I liked it and hoped he would maybe forget about it and I wouldn't have to use it. But, more recently he keeps asking me when I'm going to go and if I've booked it yet. I'm all "oh yeah I'll do it soon I'm so busy at the moment", which is obviously not an excuse I can carry on forever. So my question is should tell him I don't want to go? I would feel bad because it has been a long time now that I've pretended and he probably did put quite a bit of thought in what to get me. Also what if I do tell him, what would be the best way to bring it up without sounding like an ungrateful bitch? Or should just suck it up and go? Obviously I could make it through, especially if I had a drink or something before to help me enjoy it a bit more but I really don't want to. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Got a gift certificate for a makeover and photoshoot from my boyfriend, but I really don't want to use it. Should I tell him I don't want to go or just pretend and go through with it? How can I bring it up without sounding ungrateful?

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it's better to be honest with him. You can say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the thought, but I'm not really into that kind of thing. Can we do something else instead?' It's okay to not like a gift, and it's better to be upfront about it than to pretend and risk feeling resentful."
* "I would suggest having a conversation with him about it. You can say something like 'Hey, I know you got me this gift certificate, but I'm not really feeling it. Can we talk about what you were thinking when you got it for me?' This way, you're acknowledging his effort and showing that you value his opinion, while also being honest about your feelings."
* "I think it's okay to be honest with him, but also be kind and appreciative. You can say something like 'Thank you so much for the gift, I know you put thought into it. However, I'm not really into makeovers and photoshoots. Would you be up for doing something else together instead?' This way, you're acknowledging his effort and showing that you value his opinion, while also being honest about your feelings."
* "I would suggest having a conversation with him about it, but also be prepared for him to be disappointed or upset. It's okay to not like a gift, but it's also important to be respectful of his feelings and the effort he put into getting it for you."
* "I think it's better to be honest with him, but also be prepared for him to not understand or agree with your feelings.

Problem is she's seeing and sleeping with another guy, she's open about that and thats ok.. Ive slept around a little aswell since we are just dating,its quite casual as you would say. But im not dating/seeing anyone else but her. I dont even know how much I like this girl, she's 22, and thats too young. Anyway, recently my life's been going downhill, Im a bit lost, dont really know what job I want and such.... fuck this isnt even making much sense, I know im supposed to be cool with it, I know its casual,I know we are not exclusive. I know all this. this is eating me up!

TL;DR: 29M having a crush on 22F, we're not exclusive, she's seeing another guy, I'm not sure how much I like her, I'm feeling lost and unsure about my life.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm gonna give you some tough love. You're 29, and you're still unsure about what you want in life? That's not a problem unique to you, but it's something you need to figure out. And as for this girl, she's 22, and she's not looking for anything serious. You're getting attached, and that's okay, but you need to be honest with yourself about what you want. If you're not ready for a serious relationship, then maybe you should take a step back and focus on yourself. You're not going to find what you're looking for by getting caught up in a casual thing with someone who's not looking for the same things as you.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I feel you. I've been in similar situations before, and it's tough. But here's the thing: you can't control how others feel or what they want. You can only control how you feel and what you want. If you're feeling something for this girl, that's okay. But you need to be honest with yourself about what that means. Are you looking for something serious with her, or are you just looking for a distraction from your own problems? If it's the latter, then maybe you should take a step back and focus on yourself. But if you're genuinely interested in her, then you need to have an open and honest conversation with her about what you want. And be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I'm gonna give you some advice. You're 29, and you're still unsure about what you want in life? That's okay. We all go through that. But you need to figure it out. You can't keep living in limbo, wondering what you want and what you're doing with your life. You need to take control and make some decisions.

TITLE: I think i fucked it up, salvage advice/confirmation of negligible potential sought

POST: My story is, (24m)i have been out of relationships and even have had literally no sex life for a while.  I met a girl(22f), who i think is awesome, and she has a boyfriend.  That isnt the problem.  I respectfully act as a platonic friend to the girl i originally had feelings for, and to a lesser degree her boyfriend.  Now, somehow or another while i was drunk and we were all hanging out at a bar one of her friends(19f) came up to me and started giving me compliments and all that, she posts on a sexual comment i made on fb later on that night, i get her number not very long after (next day, first time we talk on fb).  We have been meeting up to see eachother with other people around and she always kisses me, which i am loving.  I even got her to go see a big concert with me in a city thats 30 minutes away (she brought her friend tho, and we didnt do anything but kissing/a little dancing)  Yesterday i txted her early in the day and she said "Im in a terrible fucking mood".  I ask why, she sais its personal, so i say ok, you dont have to tell me if u dont want, as long as you still talk to me.  she sais "okies"  and i guess i may have danced around it to see if she would let anything else out.  "so what are you pregnant?" lol gawd no etc etc.   well, i finally send her a last one saying to hmu if she wants to hang/talk/wtfever.  she didnt, and instead made open facebook posts about how happy she was and shit.  

heres where i fucking blew it reddit:  seeing the fb posts i txted her "hey u up? i wanna talk to u im gettin this wierd feeling that i missed my chance or somethin..."

its 730 am.  should i just go get drunk or something and try not to think about it? cuz im kinda stewing in what closely resembles highschool style rejection.

TL;DR: I met a girl, we've been hanging out, kissing, having fun, but she's got a boyfriend.  I got to know her friend, we've been hanging out too, and she's been giving me the signals.  I think i may have blown it by asking her if she's pregnant, and then texting her after seeing her happy fb posts.  Should i just forget about it and move on, or is there a way to salvage this?

---

This post is a great example of how not to handle a situation, and how to potentially blow it with someone. The OP (original poster) has been having a good time with this girl, but he's also been aware that she's got a boyfriend. He's been trying to navigate this situation, but he's made some poor choices along the way.

Firstly, he's been getting mixed signals from this girl, and he's not been clear about his intentions. He's been kissing her and having fun, but he's also been aware that she's got a boyfriend. This is a recipe for disaster.

Secondly, he's made a mistake by asking her if she's pregnant. This is a very personal question, and it's not something that you should be asking someone unless you're in a serious relationship with them. It's also a question that could potentially be misinterpreted, and it's not something that you should be using as a way to try to get closer to someone.

Finally, he's made a mistake by texting her after seeing her happy Facebook posts. This is a classic move, and it's something that's likely to make her feel uncomfortable and annoyed. It's also a sign that he's not respecting her boundaries and is trying to keep the conversation going even when she's clearly not interested.

Overall, the OP has made some poor choices in this situation, and it's likely that he's blown it with this girl. He should probably just move on and focus on finding someone who is available and interested in him.

TITLE: How can I convert a print book to an ebook?

POST: There's a book I'd like to read that isn't available as an ebook.  I'm perfectly willing to buy a DRM-laden ebook version of this book, but it's simply not available.  I bought hard copy of this book (actually 3 books, but that's splitting hairs) but, being a techie, I'd really much rather have an ebook.  Preferably in.pdf,.doc,.rtf, or some other flexible, easy-to-use format.

There has to be some way of turning a physical book into an ebook other than individually scanning each and every page by hand.  I'm sure there's some kind of specialized machine that can do it, but I don't have one.  I'd be more than willing to pay for temporary access to such a device; maybe mail the book away, or bring it to a Kinkos-like place.  The thing is I can't manage to find any service that does this.  Maybe my google-fu is weak, but all I can find are websites and programs that convert one ebook format to another, and 1 or 2 services that are only intended for authors/copyright holders (and they make you sign a thing certifying that you are such).

TL;DR: How can I convert a print book to an ebook?  Is there a service or device that can do this for me?  I'm willing to pay for it.

TITLE: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men - How do I overcome this adversity and make this pooch at least tolerate me?

POST: Been seeing this girl and it's gotten the point where we're sleeping at each others places.  She has this dog, kind of a poodle or something (not exactly sure on the breed, small, white, kind of curly hair).  She (dog) is cool in the dog park, pretty decent on a leash, but in her own dwelling, does not like men.

Dog has no history of abuse by men, but the dog does not like men.  She is pretty territorial and barks when I even get close to her closet door (where she keeps the dog when I'm around, it's a huge closet, no sketchy neglect or anything).

Getting to the point where I have to meet this small beast and make nice-nice.  What is the best way to do so?  Apparently, she nips at hands/heels and will just stare me down and growl the entire time.  Should I arrive with treats?  I've raised pups on my own and never had a problem but mostly German shepherds and Dobermans.  Never thought I'd struggle with a poodle.  

Any help or tips would be great.

TL;DR: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men. How do I overcome this adversity and make the dog at least tolerate me?

COMMENTS:

* "I'm no expert, but I think it's great you're willing to put in the effort to win over the dog. Maybe try starting with small steps, like just sitting near the dog while she's in her closet, then gradually increase the interaction. And yeah, treats are a good idea. Maybe try some of those freeze-dried liver snacks or something."
* "I had a similar experience with a cat that hated me at first. It took a while, but eventually she warmed up to me. I think the key is to show the dog that you're not a threat. Try moving slowly and calmly around her, and don't make any sudden movements. And like someone else said, treats can go a long way."
* "I'm a dog trainer and I've worked with dogs that have had issues with men before. In this case, I think it's likely that the dog has been socialized to be wary of men due to her owner's behavior. Maybe the owner is unintentionally reinforcing the dog's fear by giving in to her demands and not exposing her to men in a positive way. You might want to talk to the owner about this and see if you can work together to help the dog overcome her fear."
* "I'm not sure if this is the best approach, but I've heard that some dogs respond well to'redirection.' Maybe try distracting the dog with a toy or a treat while you're interacting with her, and see if that helps her focus on something else instead of you. Just be careful not to make the dog feel like you're trying to trick her or take away her attention."
* "I think it's great that you're willing to put in the effort to win over the dog. Just remember to be patient and don't take it personally if the dog doesn't warm up to you right away. It's not uncommon for dogs to take time to adjust to new people, especially if they have a history of being wary of men. Good luck!"


This post and its comments demonstrate a common issue that many people face when dating someone with a pet that has a strong dislike for them. The OP is willing to put in the effort to win over the dog, but is unsure of how to do so. The comments offer a range of advice, from starting with small steps and showing the dog that you're not a threat, to redirecting the dog's attention and being patient. The post also highlights the importance of communication with the dog's owner and understanding the potential underlying causes of the dog's behavior. Overall, the post and comments demonstrate a willingness to work through challenges and find a solution that benefits everyone involved.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my fiancée [27 F] 3 years, she proposed to me over a year ago and has been pressuring me to "counter propose" ever since.

POST: Our relationship has been great the past 3 years.  We rarely fight and we have a lot of fun together.

Backstory: over a year ago I ended up helping her with a medical issue and took her to the hospital to be treated for dehydration.  Carrying her in my arms, the whole nine yards.  She felt extreme gratitude afterwards and decided to throw tradition out the window by buying a pair of wedding rings and proposed to me, taping the whole thing using her laptop and recited a speech for me.  She liked it, so she put a ring on it.

We've been pumped about getting married ever since then, and have been waiting for her to be done with graduate school before we officially drop the money to tie the knot.

The problem is that in my mind, and from what we've been telling everyone, we are officially engaged and that she proposed to me.  She's been wanting me ever since to do a counter-proposal, where I basically propose back, and have a whole long written confession of my love for her.  Now, I obviously have no problem in doing so, but she said she feels like until I do so our engagement is "fake" (her words).

I feel like it's a bit messed up to have that sentiment.  Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I think that whatever proposal I come up with is just going to fall flat of her expectations, considering the magic of the surprise will not be there.  Not to mention, it kind of kills the mood if she is literally *asking* me to propose to her.

Am I being an asshole?

TL;DR: Fiancée proposed to me over a year ago, but now she's pressuring me to do a "counter-proposal" where I propose back to her.  I'm hesitant because I feel like it's just going to be awkward and she's making it seem like our engagement is "fake" until I do so.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not being an asshole. It's her proposal, not yours. You can propose whenever you want, or not at all. It's your choice."
* "I think you're being a bit too hung up on this. It's just a proposal, it's not a big deal. Do it because you want to, not because you feel pressured."
* "I'm with OP. I think it's weird that she's making a big deal about this. You're already engaged, what's the point of doing a counter-proposal?"
* "I think you should propose because it's a nice gesture and it'll make her happy. But don't do it because you feel pressured. Do it because you want to."
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. It's not like she's asking you to do something ridiculous. She's just asking you to make the proposal official. It's not a big deal."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she doesn't realize how much pressure she's putting on you. Maybe you can find a compromise that works for both of you."

**Conclusion:** The comments are mixed, but overall, most people think that OP is not being an asshole and that he should propose because he wants to, not because he feels pressured. Some people think that it's a nice gesture and will make his fiancée happy, while others think that it's not a big deal and that he should do it because he wants to. The comments also suggest that OP should have a conversation with his fiancée about how he's feeling and try to find a compromise that works for both of them. Ultimately, the decision is up to OP and what he feels comfortable with.

TITLE: I (27m) am dating a married woman (27f) and we've been seeing each other for four months now. I don't know what to do.

POST: I'll keep this brief. I always wanted to be married, want a family and kids, that hasn't changed. Dating has been crappy for me as I've been so focused on working since I come from a very poor family. I'm 27 now, doing well with my career (well enough for now anyways) so I have more "time" for dating.

Used Tinder for a while, had some fun flings, met a chick who was in an "open marriage" and just wanted to date. I thought it would be easy sex, went along with it. One thing led to another and now I love her, and she loves me. She admits this, but does not want to leave her husband (which was the first guy she ever dated, and according to her friends screams at her and manipulates her and is garbage, but it's her decision)

So, she doesn't want to leave him, loves me, I love her... I've been dating her for around four months now and I've been keeping it going hoping to build a bond with her and when I can have a'very' serious talk with her about things I'll have more of a potential for her to consider my words about our future.

I need some advice. What should I do here? Should I stop seeing her?

Oh, and a side note... I'm terrified this woman is my soul mate. I've been in love, dated... and never felt a connection in my life like I do with this woman. So there's that. (Sorry for broken jumbled post)

TL;DR: I'm 27, dating a married woman (27f) who loves me, but doesn't want to leave her husband. I love her, but don't know what to do. Should I stop seeing her?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Dude, you need to stop seeing her. You deserve better than to be in a situation where you're not the priority. You're not going to be able to build a life with someone who is still married to someone else. It's not fair to you or her husband. You need to take care of yourself and find someone who is available and willing to be with you."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I understand why you're torn, but you need to prioritize your own well-being. You can't keep stringing along a married woman who is not willing to leave her husband. It's not healthy for you or her. You deserve someone who is committed to you and willing to work on a relationship with you. Take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. You might be surprised at how much better you feel when you're not in a situation that's causing you so much stress and uncertainty."
3. **u/realistic_expectations**: "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but you're in a bad situation. You're in love with a married woman who doesn't want to leave her husband. That's not a recipe for a healthy or happy relationship. You need to take a hard look at your priorities and figure out what you want. Do you want to be with this woman, even if it means being in a situation that's not ideal? Or do you want to find someone who is available and willing to be with you? You can't keep straddling the fence and expecting things to work out. You need to make a decision and move forward."
4. **u/empathetic_observer**: "I can understand why you're torn. You've built a connection with this woman and you care about her deeply. But you need to remember that you deserve better than to be in a situation where you're not the priority. You deserve someone who is committed to you and willing to work on a relationship with you. Take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. You might be surprised at how much better you feel when you're not in a situation that's causing you so much stress and uncertainty."

**Conclusion:** The majority of commenters agree that the OP should stop seeing the married woman and prioritize his own well-being. They emphasize that he deserves someone who is committed to him and willing to work on a relationship with him, and that being in a situation where he's not the priority is not healthy or sustainable. Some commenters also suggest that the OP should take a step back and focus on himself for a bit, and that he might be surprised at how much better he feels when he's not in a situation that's causing him so much stress and uncertainty. Only a few commenters suggest that the OP should try to work things out with the married woman, but most agree that this is not a viable or healthy option.

TITLE: Me(22F) with my sister(18F) and her boyfriend(17M) Should I say something?

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for a little over a year now. They are each others first relationships. 

I recently got out of a 3 year abusive relationship. My anger toward my ex might be clouding my judgement but I'm not sure. 

For a while I've been noticing dysfunctional things in their relationship that remind me of my ex. Her boyfriend is acting like a typical 17 year old boy and is really into the physical aspect of their relationship. My sister is borderline verbally abusive to him. She says things like, "I don't know why you love me, maybe you shouldn't." I feel that she treats him poorly, is rude to him and expects way too much out of him. She tells him that we, her family hates him. I've heard them talk about getting married when he turns 18 so they can have sex without getting in trouble with my conservative Christian parents. 

My sister leaves for college in the fall and I think that's creating more strain. They fight a lot more often. 

So I'm wondering, do I say something to the boyfriend? I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen, she just assumes all my words mean I hate her relationship and her. I think there's potential for mistakes, heartbreak and regrets on both their parts and I don't want that to happen. Should I talk to her boyfriend, tell him we don't hate him, we just have concerns?

TL;DR: My sister is in a toxic relationship and I'm unsure if I should say something to her boyfriend. I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen. I want to help them avoid potential mistakes, heartbreak, and regrets.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, you're in a tough spot. It's great that you're concerned about your sister's well-being, but you also need to consider the potential consequences of intervening. Have you talked to your parents about this? They might be able to offer some guidance and support. If you do decide to talk to the boyfriend, make sure you're coming from a place of concern and not judgment. It's possible that he's not aware of the dynamics in the relationship and might appreciate someone telling him the truth."
2. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "OP, I think you should talk to your sister again, but this time, try to approach the conversation in a non-judgmental way. Instead of saying 'your relationship is toxic,' say 'I've noticed some things that are making me worried about you guys' and then share specific examples. Also, try to focus on how her behavior is affecting her, rather than the boyfriend. You might say something like, 'I've noticed that you're being really critical of him lately, and it's making me worried that you're not treating him with the respect and kindness that he deserves.' This approach might help your sister see things from a different perspective and make some changes."
3. **u/relationship_advisor**: "OP, I think you're right to be concerned about your sister's relationship. It's great that you're thinking about the potential consequences of intervening. Before you talk to the boyfriend, I would suggest having a conversation with your sister again and trying to get her to see things from a different perspective. You might say something like, 'I know you love him, but I'm worried that you're not treating him well. I want to help you work through this and find a healthier way to communicate with each other.' If your sister is still not willing to listen, then it might be worth talking to the boyfriend, but make sure you're coming from a place of concern and not judgment. It's also important to remember that ultimately, your sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. You can't force her to leave the relationship, but you can offer her support and guidance if she's willing to listen."

**Key takeaways:**

* OP should consider talking to her parents about her concerns before intervening in her sister's relationship.
* OP should approach the conversation with her sister again, focusing on specific examples and how her behavior is affecting her, rather than the boyfriend.
* If OP decides to talk to the boyfriend, she should come from a place of concern and not judgment, and try to focus on the potential consequences of the relationship for both parties.
* Ultimately, OP's sister is an adult and can make her own decisions, but OP can offer her support and guidance if she's willing to listen.

TITLE: Reddit, I need your help with an over-protective mother.

POST: I'm 17, and recently started seeing a 20 year old. We've become extremely close, and since I met him I've been much happier and more motivated to do well in other areas of my life. I already get good grades at a difficult school, play sports, and have never had problems with drinking or drugs. Our relationship is what keeps me balanced.

My parents have been divorced for several years, and I live with my dad nearly full time. My mother is a bit over-protective, so I anticipated some difficulty, but not like this. She thinks that the age difference is too great for somebody my age, and doesn't want me to date him. This, I understand; it's her prerogative to be concerned. It can be worked around. The real problem is that she is now trying to attack my dad legally for being a bad parent, neglecting my safety, etc. On top of this, she refuses to talk to me about how we can compromise, just insists that this is in my best interest in the long run. 

I've been looking for articles about how being in a stable, loving relationship is healthy for young adults (articles seem to be the best way to get through to her), but I can't find many that address the pros of teenage relationships. What I really need is to convince her that this is a healthy thing, something that falls in line with her need to'shape me into a good young lady'.

Any ideas?

Note: "you're 17, you're too young to be dating, just enjoy life and don't feel like you need to be with somebody..." Yes, yes I know. This boy fell right out of the fucking sky, and I care about him and trust him more than almost anybody. I'm not going to give up on this just because of some age/family issues.

TL;DR: 17 year old girl dating 20 year old, over-protective mother trying to break us up, refuses to talk about compromise. Need help convincing her that this is a healthy relationship.

TITLE: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, but its more complex than it seems. Please help!

POST: I live with some college girlfriends in a small city in a very old home. I pay rent, utilities, (which include water, gas, heat, cable, internet, etc) and my own foodstuffs since I'm on a specific diet. I have known this girl for 5 years, and she has a boyfriend that NEVER leaves. It's not like he's a typical mid twenties burnout either - he's a teacher in a great school district, makes good money, and has his own place sans roommates less than two city blocks away. 

Basically, he is always here. Never leaves for more than his workdays and to pick up clean clothes from his place. He literally lives here, showering, cooking, doing laundry, and hanging out in the common areas even when his girlfriend isn't here. PLus, they have loud sex every night, which doesn't really bug me, but its getting a little annoying when you have early mornings and you are awoken to a slamming headboard at 2am every night...

Here is the real problem though. Many other sites that address this problem suggest that the boyfriend should chip in with rent and/or utilities. Here is the kicker - the roommate doesn't pay rent since its her fathers place. She has a joint bank account with her Dad (who is my landlord) to which she pays me the utilities that are in my name. She is a new grad and unemployed, so I know she isn't paying rent with her own money.

Myself and the third roommate are getting seriously frustrated. We both work hard at out entry level jobs to make ends meet, plus the work in maintaing the house. I basically feel like I am financing their love nest, and I'm sick of it. 

Sorry that was so long, I feel much better getting all that out.

TL;DR: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, pays no rent, and is a general nuisance. How do I address this without causing drama?

---

This post has sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many users offering advice and opinions on how to handle the situation. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* The importance of having an open and honest conversation with the roommate about the issues and concerns
* The need to establish clear boundaries and expectations for the household
* The possibility of having a joint conversation with the roommate and her boyfriend to address the issues
* The potential for the roommate to take on more responsibilities and contribute financially to the household
* The importance of considering the roommate's perspective and the potential for misunderstandings or miscommunications

Some users have also suggested that the OP consider talking to the landlord (the roommate's father) about the situation, as he may be able to provide guidance or support in resolving the issue.

Overall, the discussion has been helpful in providing the OP with a range of perspectives and potential solutions to address the situation. However, it's clear that the issue is complex and may require a delicate and nuanced approach to resolve.

TITLE: Missing a suitable excuse to see my[20M] long distance girlfriend[20F]

POST: Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this...
So my girlfriend is in our home town at the moment and I'll be traveling there to see her. We both haven't told our parents about our relationship, we have talked about this so we're both comfortable with it. My parents would react extremely surprised and would immediately want to know everything about her and meet her the same day.

I need a car from my parents for the whole day to see her and really need an excuse firstly why I'm in town altogether and secondly why I need a car the whole day... Can you think of an excuse that might work? I still have friends there if that helps.

TL;DR: Need an excuse to see my long distance girlfriend without my parents finding out, need a reason to be in town and need a car for the whole day.

**Top comments:**

1. "Dude, just tell your parents the truth. It's not worth lying to them. You're 20, it's not like you're 12 and need to sneak around. Just be honest and have an open conversation with them." (123 upvotes)
2. "I get it, you want to keep it a secret for now. But honestly, it's not a good idea to lie to your parents. They'll find out eventually and it'll be worse when they do. Just be honest and have a conversation with them. It's better to be upfront and honest than to risk losing their trust." (56 upvotes)
3. "If you're really set on keeping it a secret, maybe you could tell your parents you're going to a friend's house to study or something? And then just say you need the car to run some errands or something. Just be careful not to overthink it and make it too complicated." (34 upvotes)
4. "I'm a bit surprised you're not just telling your parents the truth. It's not like it's a big deal or anything. But if you're really set on keeping it a secret, maybe you could tell them you're going to a friend's house to watch a game or something? And then just say you need the car to pick up some stuff from the store or something. Just be careful not to overthink it and make it too complicated." (23 upvotes)

**Reddit's response:** The majority of the comments are advising the OP to be honest with his parents and not to lie to them.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my _Friend__ [23 F] 2 years of something confusing

POST: These past couple of years I had it very rough when it came to socializing and being happy. Well, friends kinda used some drugs and I was left alone for a while I later found out...but, before that....

I started to stay away from it as I lost confidence, had low self esteem,etc. I eventually and mutually met someone. I was shy but she was outgoing so I guess it evened out somehow.Asked me alot about myself and it felt good. We were going to be meeting more often so next time....when that came she randomly came over and hugged me and introduced me to some friends. We talked for a bit,said she was a bit concerned with her apperance and then she blurts out...let me give you my number, we will get lunch soon which we did. Went well. 

I bonded with her more and more as I saw her, got a random selfie with her which was odd, but also was called sweet for a thank you I gave her. 

Now there was times she was very rude or inconsiderate. She is known by others to be immature but I look past that most of the time as she did help me out. 

The weirdest event was her kinda following me. I was going to a game with friends and invited her and her friends like a week in advance. Gave her a heads up and she said she was busy, so I left it at that. I go to the game and was walking around and look down and saw her and all her friends. Okay someone else could have had an idea to go but come on that was a bit weird that she showed up then and there when she basically said no. 

I dont want to go into too much detail to things unless needed but I didnt know if I was being played here or she liked me or it was her personality or I dont even know what. I personally grew to like her but have not seen her in a while for certain reasons.

TL;DR: I met someone 2 years ago, we bonded, had good times, but also had some weird moments. I'm unsure if she likes me or if it's just her personality. I grew to like her but haven't seen her in a while.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're unsure about her intentions and feelings towards you. Have you talked to her about how you feel? Maybe it's time to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see how she reacts."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She might just be a friendly person who enjoys your company. Don't read too much into it. Just enjoy the time you spend with her and see where it goes."
* "I think you're being played. She's been stringing you along and using you for her own entertainment. You deserve better than that. Cut ties with her and move on."
* "I think you're being too harsh on her. She might be immature, but that doesn't mean she's intentionally trying to hurt you. Maybe she's just not ready for a serious relationship. You should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see where it goes."
* "I think you're just being paranoid. She's probably just a friendly person who enjoys your company. Don't overthink it and just enjoy the time you spend with her."

TITLE: Has screen-sharing been throttled on Skype and are there alternatives?

POST: Hello friends!

I am in a long distance relationship and as such Skype has been a major boon to the quality of our lives. This has been downgraded somewhat recently.

Me and my girlfriend would screen-share so we could enjoy movies and episodes together. It might not seem like much but we cherished the ability. I subscribed to the Skype service solely to keep that for us. 

Some time ago screen-sharing just stopped being able to cope with running video. I think this was around the time Microsoft acquired Skype although I'm not sure. This is confounding since both of us still enjoy good web connections and use high definition webcams that stream very well under normal conditions. 

Furthermore we have discovered that if we screen-share for any reason our call is seemingly throttled and we have to recall to regain quality.

I have googled this to no avail and I was wondering if anybody has any knowledge about this situation and/or knows a working alternative?

TL;DR: Skype screen-sharing has become unreliable and seems to throttle our calls. Are there any alternatives that can provide a similar experience?

---

**Top comments:**

1. "I've noticed the same issue with screen-sharing on Skype. It's really frustrating. I've tried using third-party apps like Join.me and ScreenFlow, but they don't seem to be as seamless as Skype's built-in feature. Have you tried using Google Hangouts or Zoom? They both have decent screen-sharing capabilities."
2. "I've had similar issues with Skype, but I think it's more related to the quality of your internet connection rather than the app itself. Have you tried checking your internet speed and quality? It might be worth upgrading your plan or switching to a different provider."
3. "I've used Skype for years and never had any issues with screen-sharing. However, I do remember that Microsoft did make some changes to the app after they acquired it. It's possible that these changes affected the screen-sharing feature. Have you tried reaching out to Skype support to see if they can help you troubleshoot the issue?"
4. "I've been using Discord for screen-sharing and it's been working great for me. It's free, easy to use, and has a lot of features. You can also use it for voice and video calls, as well as text chat. It's definitely worth checking out."
5. "I've tried using Skype's built-in screen-sharing feature, but it's always been a bit finicky for me. I've had better luck using third-party apps like OBS Studio and XSplit. They're both free and have a lot of customization options. You can also use them for live streaming and recording."

TITLE: I (M20) don't know of SO (F19) of 4 years is being fair.

POST: A few months ago, we had a pretty big argument. She was upset over it, and I asked her repeatedly if there was anything that I could do to help. She said that she was fine and during the week we had tons of fun so I genuinely believed she was fine. The next few days she messaged me telling me that she's horribly sad, and that she can't believe that I let her feel sad when we were together. 
(Oh! Quick note, she lives in a college a few hours away, and comes to visit every other weekend along with her best friend.) 
Now, this isn't the first time she gas done this, this happens weekly, where she does not communicate clearly how she's feeling and what she wants me to do, then she explodes on me. 
I was furious that she would have the nerve to tell me that I didn't try to make her feel better when I had at one point begged for her to tell me how she was really feeling, so I ended things with her compulsively (over text, so a total dick move on my part). She then called me a few seconds later telling me she was sorry and that she was wrong. I told her that I made a super compulsive decision when I "ended things" and that I was sorry and didn't mean it at all. That I just acted without thinking.
Everything was fine and dandy, until recently.
 This is the problem:
Now she's telling me that she is VERY sad because I broke up with her (even after I apologized to her for doing so, and practically begged her to believe that I didn't mean it) and she says that she is feeling insecure about the relationship because I had "ended things." She wants me to make it up to her by doing this grand gesture for her as a way of showing her that I really do love her (which I do) and to make her secure of this relationship. She wants me to make her feel better. And she's very upset that I have not done it yet.

Is that fair of her? I don't understand how it could be, but maybe I'm wrong. And what can I do to solve this issue?

TL;DR: SO of 4 years does not communicate clearly, explodes on me, then tells me I didn't try to make her feel better. I ended things compulsively, apologized, and begged her to believe me. Now she's telling me she's sad and insecure because I "ended things" and wants me to make it up to her with a grand gesture.

**Community Response:**

The community is divided on whether the OP's SO is being fair or not. Some people think that the OP's SO is being unreasonable and that the OP should not have to make grand gestures to prove his love. Others think that the OP's SO is being hurt and that the OP should try to make it up to her.

Some common themes that emerge from the comments are:

* The importance of clear communication in relationships. Many people comment that the OP's SO's lack of clear communication is a major issue and that it's causing problems in the relationship.
* The need for the OP to set boundaries and prioritize his own emotional well-being. Some people suggest that the OP should not feel obligated to make grand gestures to prove his love and that he should prioritize his own emotional well-being.
* The importance of empathy and understanding in relationships. Many people comment that the OP's SO is feeling hurt and insecure and that the OP should try to understand and validate her feelings, even if he doesn't agree with her demands.

Some possible solutions that are suggested by the community include:

* Having an open and honest conversation with the SO about the issues in the relationship and the need for clear communication.
* Setting boundaries and prioritizing the OP's own emotional well-being.
* Trying to understand and validate the SO's feelings, even if the OP doesn't agree with her demands.
* Considering couples therapy to work through the issues in the relationship.

Overall, the community is divided on whether the OP's SO is being fair or not, but many people agree that the relationship needs work and that clear communication is key.

TITLE: [update] Gf doesn't think I put an effort into spending time with her.

POST: Ok here is an update of a post I made yesterday. 

I'm 27 and she is 28.  We've been together 2 1/2 yrs. and we live together.

Yesterday she got mad at me over the phone for not wanting to go to the beach the next day (she was on a lunch break). After we hung up she texted me and said I never try to spend time with her. I apologized and said let's go. She said she was over it and will go with friends. 

After that she texts me and says she is going out after work with friends and wont be home until late. She also said she can't go to my friends wedding next week. 

She doesn't come home  till midnight last night and when she walks in she doesn't speak to me and proceeds to watch tv in the living room and then she slept on the couch. 

In the morning I wake and she is in the bed. I try to hug her but she pushes me away and says  nothing. I fall back asleep. When I wake up again she is in the living watching tv. I say good morning and she doesn't reply back. 

Now I'm in the bedroom and she is on the couch watching tv. I don't want to fight with her but I want us to talk out the situation.

I don't know what to do reddit. Is this acceptable for a partner to be like this? Should I talk to her?

TL;DR: Girlfriend doesn't think I put an effort into spending time with her, and she's been distant and cold towards me since our argument yesterday.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's been feeling neglected and unheard for a while. You need to have a real conversation with her about how you can improve your relationship and make her feel more included. Don't just apologize and expect everything to go back to normal." (123 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit too reactive to her behavior. Instead of trying to hug her and talk to her, why don't you try to understand what's going on with her? Maybe she's stressed or overwhelmed and needs some space. Give her some time and space, and then have a calm conversation with her about how you can work together to improve your relationship." (56 upvotes)
* "I'm not sure what's going on with your girlfriend, but it sounds like she's been feeling pretty unhappy in the relationship. You need to take a step back and think about what you can do to make her feel more loved and appreciated. It's not just about going to the beach or doing activities together - it's about showing her that you care about her and value her feelings." (34 upvotes)
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. She's not being unreasonable, and you need to stop being so defensive. You need to listen to her and try to understand her perspective. Maybe you're not putting in enough effort, and maybe you need to step up your game." (21 upvotes)
* "I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with your girlfriend. Explain to her how you feel and what you think is going on, and ask her to do the same. Try to find a compromise and work together to improve your relationship. And maybe consider couples therapy to help you both communicate more effectively." (15 upvotes)

TITLE: TIFU by flooding my classroom and forcing my entire class outside for 2 weeks.

POST: Okay so to start things off this didn't happen today, more like 12 years ago. 

So I went to a small country primary school in Ireland. We had maybe 200 students total, if even that and my class (6th class, highest grade in the school, we were all roughly 12) shared a room with 5th class. The school is just outside of a small town and on rare occasions the water would turn off completely. This has only happened maybe twice while I was at the school.

One day the water went, towards the end of the school day. We had PE outside at the end of the day and afterwards some of us stayed playing until we were getting picked up. I went in to get my stuff before going home and went to wash my hands. Turned the tap on but nothing came out. At this stage the school was basically empty and the teachers were gone home. I didn't notice that the plug was in the sink and didnt think to turn the tap off again as there was no water coming out.

Shoot forward to the following morning and the room is completely flooded. The room is about 90% carpet so that is completely soaked and starting to stink. Its early june at this point and while I know Irish weather gets a bad rep it was a nice summer. We had to spend the last 2 weeks of school outside (literally no there room in the school for us) and while we did do some actual work we mostly got to play. We had taken our exams for secondary school already so there was nothing to study for. 

I never told anyone it was me but I knew immediately that I had done it. I spose it worked out for me but I know it probably cost the school a good bit of money seeing as it was a small school. Principal also took the blame for it cause she used to check to make sure the taps were off to avoid this. Felt bad for her but it was pretty good for me.

TL;DR: Flooded my classroom by leaving the tap on and had to spend the last 2 weeks of school outside with my class.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and embarrassing tale of a mistake they made in the past. In this case, the author accidentally flooded their classroom by leaving the tap on, which resulted in the entire class having to spend the last two weeks of school outside. The post is relatable, entertaining, and has a good dose of self-deprecation, making it a great fit for the r/tifu subreddit. The author's admission of guilt and the humorous spin they put on the situation make the post enjoyable to read. The story also highlights the importance of being mindful of one's actions and taking responsibility for one's mistakes. Overall, this post is a great example of a well-crafted TIFU story.

TITLE: My [23M] sister [20F] got engaged 4 months after I did, am I wrong for being upset?

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 years and lived together all through their 2 years of college (canada), and my fiancee and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. We got engaged 4 months ago after living together for 1 year. My sister brought it up to me that she wanted to know if I had any problems with her getting engaged since I just got engaged, at first I told her I was happy for her and then before it happened I told her I'm mad about it because I feel like they are going to take away our moment and showing off our engagement. When I told her I was mad she apologized and said there is nothing she can really do and that she doesn't want to or plan on taking away from their our engagement, but i'm still upset and feel like they only got engaged to one up us and because we got engaged.

Am I in the wrong for being upset about it or is she being a terrible sister?

TL;DR: My sister got engaged 4 months after I did, and I'm upset because I feel like they're trying to one-up us and take away our moment. Am I wrong for feeling this way?

---

This post is an example of a common theme in the r/relationships subreddit: sibling rivalry and feelings of jealousy or competition. The OP (original poster) is upset because his sister got engaged shortly after he did, and he feels like she's trying to one-up him and take away from his special moment.

The post is likely to receive a mix of reactions, with some people agreeing with the OP and others telling him he's being unfair or unreasonable. Some possible responses might include:

* "You're being ridiculous, congratulations to your sister and her fiancé!"
* "I can understand why you'd feel that way, but maybe try to focus on your own relationship and engagement instead of comparing yourself to your sister."
* "It's not about one-upping you, it's about your sister and her partner's own relationship and happiness. Try to be happy for them instead of feeling jealous."
* "You're being unfair, your sister didn't get engaged to spite you or your fiancé. Maybe try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling instead of just assuming the worst."

Overall, the post is a good example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a platform for people to share their feelings and get feedback and support from others. However, it's also important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and what might be upsetting to one person might not be to another.

TITLE: How do I tell my professors that I missed two weeks of class because I was going through opiate withdrawal?

POST: From sometime in October until just before school started up again two weeks ago I was hooked on pain killers. I started with morphine and eventually got to a point where I was doing almost any opiate I could get my hands on, with the notable exception of heroin. 

I made the decision to stop after the holiday break because I saw how my world was falling apart: my grades dropped, I became a farcical character in my social circles (became "that guy who's always high"), and I had a couple close calls with the police.  These, among other reasons, prompted my family to tell me how worried they were about me, so I decided I could just go cold turkey and it would not affect my studies too much.

Wrong.  I have missed almost every class since two weeks ago, with little to no contact with any professors.  The few classes I did attend I went a sweaty, detached mess of a man.  My problem now is that I need to pass these classes, preferably with decent grades.  This is my last semester and I really want to be done.  

So, I come to you, Reddit, with the hope that some one out there can point me in the right direction, so I might get my shit together. I don't really know how to approach anyone about this in person, and I'm absolutely terrified of facing my peers and my instructors. Also, to the best of knowledge there is nobody, including parents, friends, etc., that knows the full extent of my problem.

Ideas?

TL;DR: I'm a college student who went through opiate withdrawal and missed two weeks of class. I'm scared to tell my professors and don't know how to approach them. Help! 

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I'm not a medical professional, but it sounds like you're in a really tough spot.

Also, it might be helpful to reach out to your professors and explain your situation. They might be more understanding than you think, and they can work with you to find a solution. Just be honest and open with them, and I'm sure they'll do their best to help you out."

2. **u/anonymous123456**: "I'm not a medical professional either, but I do know that opiate withdrawal is a serious condition that requires medical attention.

Additionally, they can also provide you with resources and support to help you stay sober and avoid relapse. It's not easy to go through withdrawal, but with the right help and support, you can get through it and start rebuilding your life."

3. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I'm not a medical professional, but I do know that it's great that you're taking steps to get help and get your life back on track. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you need help and to seek it out. I would suggest reaching out to your professors and explaining your situation to them. They might be more understanding than you think, and they can work with you to find a solution. Just be honest and open with them, and I'm sure they'll do their best to help you out."

TITLE: 18f. Am I going insane? Are my relationship expectations too high?

POST: I hope I am posting in the right subreddit for this. Lately I have been feeling....anomalous(?) regarding what I want out of a relationship. Another fling of mine was recently ended because he 21M did not want to "marginalize his friendships." When I am in a relationship, I want a Tabula Rasa -- a complete clean slate. I don't want my significant other to be facebook friends or have any contact whatsoever with previous ex-girlfriends and/or people he has slept with. I provide the same respect. I am accepting of friends of the opposite sex as long as there is not a sexual or romantic past. It would make me uncomfortable if they were to hang out independently though, and I would prefer a group setting. 

It's as if my ideals are from another planet. All of the men I have met seem to think my relationship expectations are absolutely ludicrous. I, on the other hand, do not think it is expecting too much of a person. I am feeling lonely and as if there is something wrong with me. Am I being overbearing? I would really appreciate some objective opinions.

TL;DR: I want a relationship where my partner has no contact with previous ex-girlfriends or people they have slept with. I am willing to provide the same respect. I feel like my expectations are too high and everyone I meet thinks I am being unreasonable. Am I being overbearing?

COMMENTS:

1. "Honestly, your expectations are pretty high. While it's understandable that you'd want your partner to prioritize your relationship, cutting off all contact with past partners and friends might be a bit extreme. It's not uncommon for people to maintain friendships with friends of the opposite sex, and it's not necessarily a sign of disloyalty to your partner. Maybe consider compromising on this issue and finding a middle ground that works for both of you."
2. "I think your expectations are reasonable, but it's also important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries. It's not about being 'overbearing,' it's about being respectful of each other's needs. If your partner is willing to work with you on this, then that's great. But if they're not, it might be worth reevaluating whether this is the right relationship for you."
3. "I'm a woman, and I have to say that I've had similar expectations in the past. But I've come to realize that it's not about 'cutting off' people from your past, it's about being open and honest with your partner about your feelings and boundaries. If your partner is willing to have those conversations with you and work through any issues that come up, then that's a sign of a healthy relationship. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to communicate openly with your partner about what you need."
4. "I think you're being a bit too rigid. Relationships are about compromise and understanding. If your partner has a close friend of the opposite sex, it doesn't mean they're going to cheat on you or anything. It's just a friendship. Maybe try to relax a bit and focus on building a connection with your partner instead of worrying about what they're doing with their friends."
5. "I'm a guy, and I have to say that I've had similar expectations in the past. But I've come to realize that it's not about 'cutting off' people from your past, it's about being open and honest with your partner about your feelings and boundaries. If your partner is willing to have those conversations with you and work through any issues that come up, then that's a sign of a healthy relationship. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to communicate openly with your partner about what you need."

Overall, the comments are mixed, with some people agreeing that the OP's expectations are high, while others think they are reasonable. Some commenters suggest compromising and finding a middle ground, while others encourage the OP to communicate openly with their partner about their feelings and boundaries. The comments also highlight the importance of understanding and respecting each other's needs in a relationship.

TITLE: (M) Kinda new to having a female friend...

POST: -Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit but I figured it was a good place to start-

So I just started my college career (woo) and one thing I'm not sure about is female friends. I had friends who were girls in high school, but all of my REALLY close friends were guys. I'm on a co-ed floor, and I'm getting pretty close to a girl who lives near me. I have a girlfriend (goes to a different school) and she knows that, so she knows that I'm not interested in more than a friendship (I would hope), but I'm really interested in being close friends. However I'm not really sure what I can/can't do with a close friend who happens to be a girl... Like if I went to get food with a close guy friend or took a bus from campus to a store to get something with a guy friend it wouldn't be weird, but are there some things you don't do with a friend who's a girl that you'd do with a friend who's a guy?
Thanks for the help, I don't wanna like lead her on or something that would ruin a friendship because I really would like to be friends with her.

TL;DR: New to having a close female friend, unsure what I can/can't do with her. Want to be friends, but don't wanna lead her on or do anything weird.

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456789**: "Hey OP, congrats on taking the initiative to ask for advice! It's totally normal to feel unsure about how to navigate a close friendship with someone of the opposite sex, especially if you're not used to it. Here's the thing: it's not about what you can or can't do with her, it's about being respectful and considerate of her boundaries and feelings. If you're genuinely interested in being friends, you can start by having open and honest conversations with her about your intentions and boundaries. Ask her what she's comfortable with and what she's not. It's also important to remember that just because you're friends with someone, it doesn't mean you're 'leading her on' or anything like that. People can have close friendships with people of the opposite sex without any romantic implications. Just be yourself, be respectful, and communicate openly with her. Good luck!"
* **u/FemmeFatale88**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've had my own experiences with close friendships with guys, and it can be weird at first, but it's totally possible to have a close and meaningful friendship with someone of the opposite sex. Just remember to be mindful of your own feelings and boundaries, too. It's okay to have feelings for someone, but it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and not get too caught up in the idea of 'what could be.' Focus on building a strong and healthy friendship with her, and the rest will fall into place. And hey, if things do develop romantically, that's okay too! Just be honest with yourself and with her about your feelings. Good luck, and I hope you and your friend have a blast together!"

TITLE: So I have this friend...[M]

POST: One of my best friends, lets call him Greg, has a routine. Once he meets someone he wants to be friends with he ditches all his current friends and becomes best friends with the new guy. 

After about a month, Greg comes back to his old friends with the new friend and integrates him in to our little group. Everything is great; everybody is friends. 

But after a while, Greg stops being as close with new friend in order to make the new friend, say Allen, feel like he messed up and lost his chance to be friends with Greg. Allen is mad and acts like a dick to Greg and Greg does it back. After a while, Allen decides to stop being friends with Greg, but that would mean losing all his new friends who he met through Greg, who he likes better than Greg anyway.

Unfortunately, all of Greg's friends are on Greg's side because he put them though the "best friend" routine too and they have turned in to his brown-nosing army. 

Allen can either apologize and keep his friends, but be caught in Greg's manipulative trap again, leading to the same outcome or stop being friends with all of them.

What should Allen do?

TL;DR: Friend Greg has a routine of ditching old friends for new ones, then makes them feel like they lost their chance to be friends with him. New friend Allen is stuck between apologizing and losing his new friends or stopping being friends with all of them.

---

**Comments:**

* "Allen should just stop being friends with all of them. It's not worth being manipulated and treated like crap. He deserves better."
* "I think Allen should try to have an open and honest conversation with Greg about how he's feeling. Maybe Greg doesn't realize the harm he's causing."
* "Allen should apologize and move on. It's not worth losing all his new friends over. He can always make new friends."
* "Greg is a master manipulator. Allen should cut ties with him and his friends. They're not worth the drama."
* "Allen should try to rally the other friends and have a group conversation with Greg about how his behavior is affecting them. Maybe they can all work together to change his ways."
* "Allen should just block Greg and his friends on social media. It's not worth the stress and drama."
* "I think Allen should try to find a way to make amends with Greg, but also set boundaries for himself. He doesn't have to put up with being treated like crap."
* "Allen should stop being friends with Greg and his friends. They're toxic and not worth the drama."
* "Allen should try to have a conversation with Greg about how his behavior is affecting Allen's mental health. Maybe Greg will realize the harm he's causing and change his ways."
* "Allen should just move on and focus on his own life. He doesn't need Greg or his friends in his life."



**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are divided on what Allen should do. Some people think Allen should cut ties with Greg and his friends, while others think he should try to have an open and honest conversation with Greg about how he's feeling. Some people think Allen should apologize and move on, while others think he should set boundaries for himself. Ultimately, the decision is up to Allen and what he feels is best for his own well-being.

TITLE: My (27m) relationship questions!

POST: Hi reddit. I have been doing a lot of self reflection lately, having just come out of a 1.5yr relationship 2 months ago. 

There's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. 

I had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. 

It's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. 

Can anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships. Any more info needed or questions I'll be  sure to answer! Thanks

TL;DR: I was in a 1.5yr relationship and became very attached to my partner, getting anxious when she was away. I felt like she wasn't interested in me and did things to make her jealous. I had low self-esteem and felt like she kept me at an arms length. I'm trying to understand what happened and how to avoid it in future relationships.

TITLE: Me [19M] and my ex gf [18F] have just broken up and I need some reassurance

POST: Will start with a little back story:

I had been with my gf for a little over a year, and it has honestly been one of the happiest years of my life. My gf adored me and made me so happy. I moved away to university in September whilst my gf stayed at home and we've seen each other semi-regularly since I've been away.

Since I moved away however it has felt different. Don't get me wrong, the amount I love and cared for her hasn't changed, but I have been beginning to feel that I am not ready for a serious relationship at my age. There are many things that I would like to do whilst I am still young that I couldn't do with a serious gf and I was beginning to not be able to be the bf I wanted to be for her because my heart wasn't 100% in it. It had gotten to the stage where I just knew I had to end it because I was, and have been for a while, staying with her to avoid upsetting her, as opposed to it being what I truly wanted which are not the right reasons to be in a relationship.

I know that my gf is completely crushed. She straight away blocked me on social networks and now I am scared she will never talk to me again. I know I have really hurt her, but I want nothing more than to remain friends with her eventually, but the hurt I know I have caused kills me inside, even though I feel I have made the right decision because I wanted it to end on good terms (well terms that weren't fighting terribly etc.), I still feel like shit because of what I know I have done to her.

I am just looking for some reassurance that my gf will be okay from people that have maybe been in similar situations themselves, because right now I feel like a terrible person and it's horrible.

Sorry if this message isn't the best written, but thank you for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR: Broke up with my 18F gf after a year because I realized I wasn't ready for a serious relationship and I was staying with her out of guilt. I know I've hurt her and I'm scared she'll never talk to me again. I want to remain friends with her eventually, but I'm feeling terrible about what I've done.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you did the right thing. You can't stay in a relationship just because you feel guilty or because you're afraid of hurting someone. You have to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. It's okay to take time for yourself and focus on your own growth. Your ex will get over it, and who knows, maybe you'll even become better friends in the long run."
* "I went through something similar a few years ago. I broke up with my girlfriend because I realized I wasn't ready for a serious relationship either. It was tough, but it was the right decision for me. My ex and I are still friends, and we even hang out occasionally. It's possible for you and your ex to remain friends too. Just be patient and give her space."
* "You're not a terrible person for making this decision. You're being honest with yourself and taking responsibility for your own feelings. That takes a lot of courage. Your ex will appreciate your honesty in the long run, even if it hurts right now."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You didn't hurt your ex on purpose. You're just being honest about your feelings and needs. That's not selfish, that's being authentic. Your ex will come around, and you'll both be better off for it."
* "I've been in a similar situation, and I can tell you that it's okay to take time for yourself. You don't have to rush into anything or try to fix everything right away. Just focus on yourself and your own growth. Your ex will get over it, and you'll both move on in your own time."

TITLE: Should I [22f] break up with my long distance boyfriend [26m] before or after Valentine's?

POST: We've been dating for a little less than a year, on and off, and have been FWB for two.  Have broken up once before, got back together at Thanksgiving.  We don't have plans to see each other on V-day - he'll be working all day, and lives a 12 hour drive away, and I have to work this weekend.  I told him I would drive up next weekend, and he is planning our "V-day" already.  I am certain that I want to end the relationship; however, he does genuinely care about me/love me and I want to minimize the damage.  Would it be better to get it out of the way now, via Skype, or should I drive up next weekend and then tell him? I'm worried that it will be worse if I come up, he's planned a great V-day event, and I ruin his weekend.  Is it a dick move to end it via skype?  I know the timing is terrible, but I really don't want to hold out, miserably, for another month just because of a Hallmark holiday.

TL;DR: Long distance relationship, been together for a year, want to break up, but don't want to ruin Valentine's Day. Should I do it via Skype now or wait until next weekend when I visit him?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's not about the timing, it's about being honest with yourself and your partner. If you're certain you want to end the relationship, it's better to do it now rather than dragging it out. Skype or in person, it's still going to be tough, but at least you'll be being honest with yourself and him."
* "I think it's a dick move to end it via Skype. You're already in a long distance relationship, why not make the effort to see him in person and have a real conversation? It's not about ruining his Valentine's Day, it's about being respectful and honest with each other."
* "I would say wait until next weekend. You've already planned to visit him, and it's a good opportunity to have a real conversation and closure. Plus, it's not like you're going to ruin his Valentine's Day, he's just going to be working anyway. Just be honest with him and don't make it about the holiday."
* "I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with him about your feelings and concerns before making a decision. You don't have to break up with him on Valentine's Day, but you should be honest with him about your doubts and fears. Maybe you can work through some of the issues and come out stronger on the other side."
* "I would do it via Skype now. You're already feeling uncertain and unhappy in the relationship, and dragging it out is only going to make things worse. Be honest with him, and if he's not willing to work on the relationship, then it's better to end it now rather than wasting more time."

TITLE: So...the month of December was pretty much a giant middle finger to my progress so far. Time to pick up where I left off!

POST: This is my first post here so I'll fill you in on my story so far:

5'10", male, 23 years old, currently 173 lbs (in the normal range, but I've still got more fat to lose to reach my goal).

At my heaviest I was 235 (in 2008) which I slowly brought down to 200 by July of 2011. From August to November I got more serious with my diet and exercise and got down to 165.

Then came December:

Final exam season hit, and along with it came copious amounts of coffee, energy drinks, and general bad eating habits as well as lack of exercise. However, I was alright with relaxing my diet as I was stressed about exams enough already.

Then exams finished and I went home for Christmas, where my mom had a fridge full of terribly delicious foods and snacks. Chocolates and candy were everywhere for guests (and me, apparently.) 

Combine that with seeing friends from home and drinking every other night, eating out most of those nights (and not making sensible choices, no less!), plus Christmas parties, Christmas dinner, New Years Eve party, etc. 

Long story short, 8 pounds gained. In one freakin month!

That's pretty much a whole month's progress. Gone. Not to mention the wasted month that I could have used to lose ANOTHER 8 pounds. I'm so frustrated with myself that I let it get that bad.

But I've now moved back to my place, where I have control over my grocery list, and I'm getting back on track. The chicken and vegetables are back on my list of staple foods, and its goodbye to all the sugary, processed, or deep-fried garbage that I inhaled last month. 

Thanks for being here loseit! You guys are what make it possible to say no to my previously unhealthy lifestyle and strive for a better life :) Wish me luck!

TL;DR: Gained 8 pounds in December due to poor eating habits and lack of exercise during exam season and holiday celebrations. Back on track now, and ready to get back to my goal! Help me stay motivated!

TITLE: TIFU: By looking at my GPS.

POST: So I was driving to Upstate NY to help my SO move some of her deceased grandmother's possessions home. I had just driven from CA to VA without an incident. I was 13 minutes from my destination. A police officer was passing me as I looked at my GPS, which is on my phone, which was resting on my knee. He pulls me over. Mind you I was going the exact speed limit in the right most lane. 

Turns out that in the state of NY, I dont live there and I have obonly been there like 2 times prior, that driving while holding an electronic device of any type is illegal. So he takes my license and does a check in his car. It takes forever for him to do the lookup. While he was doing the lookup another officer pulls in behind him.

I have watched cops before. It is never a good sign when backup arrives. I am thinking that I have some hidden parking ticket or warrant. Great I think,  as I soil my pants just a little. The officer comes back up to my window. He hands me my license and apologizes that he is force to give me a ticket. He is nice enough to give me the DA's number and lets me use his pen, so long as I dont stab him in the neck with it. I asked if it would get me out of the ticket, had I stabbed him in the neck. He said no. 

I thanked the officer and asked if I were allowed to drive while holding printed instructions. He informed me thst in NY, at least, I could be drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette, eating breakfast, and read the Sunday paper. I just needed to keep one hand on the wheel. I thanked him and went on my way.

TL;DR: I got pulled over for holding my GPS on my phone while driving in NY. I got a ticket, but the officer was nice and gave me the DA's number. I learned that in NY, you can do pretty much anything with your hands except hold an electronic device. I also learned that I should never look at my GPS while driving again.

TITLE: why do people not acknowledge other people when passing by?

POST: I was going to the store today, and i just happened to pass by woman who was a little above average in looks, and height, nothing really special about her. I have a habit of making eye contact and smiling to most people I cross paths with just because its nice, and theres no harm in smiling. Anyway, as soon as we made eye contact she immediately her head down, and looked away, but as soon as we passed she put her head back up again and continued as if nothing happened. This has happened to me a lot before, but for some reason today it really struck and bothered me. So Reddit, what is your take on why people do this?

TL;DR: Why do people not acknowledge others when passing by, even if they make eye contact?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456** (123 comments): "I think it's because people are often too caught up in their own thoughts and worries to acknowledge others. They might be stressed, anxious, or just not in the right mindset to care about making eye contact. It's not personal, it's just a habit."
2. **SarcasticSally** (56 comments): "I think it's because people are just trying to avoid awkward small talk. You know, the 'how's it going?' or 'nice day, huh?' nonsense. They're just trying to avoid the hassle and keep moving."
3. **OptimisticOllie** (34 comments): "I think it's because people are often too focused on their own problems to notice others. We're all just trying to get through our day, and sometimes that means not acknowledging others. But that doesn't mean we're not grateful for the small interactions we do have."
4. **RealisticRuth** (21 comments): "I think it's because people are just not that interested in others. Sorry to say it, but sometimes people just don't care about making connections with others. They're too busy with their own lives to bother."
5. **PhilosophicalPhil** (15 comments): "I think it's because we're all just trying to navigate our own existential crises. We're all just trying to figure out who we are and where we fit in the world, and sometimes that means not acknowledging others. It's not about being rude, it's just about being human."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments, guys! I was really hoping to get some insight into this phenomenon. I think I agree with throwaway123456 that people are often too caught up in their own thoughts to acknowledge others. But at the same time, I think it's also important to acknowledge that sometimes people just don't care. Maybe it's not personal, but it still feels a little lonely to be ignored. Thanks for the discussion, Reddit!" (12 comments)

TITLE: My girlfriend [17 F] of 4 months told me [19 M] her education is more of a priority than our relationship.

POST: The day before she said this, she was at my house and I was complaining about how she never does anything when we're alone together, she always waits for me to do something. She doesn't touch me ever and she doesn't ever make a move. I need my physical stimuli haha! 

Anyways, that day I just felt so alone. She would literally stare into blank space instead of looking at me. She wouldn't acknowledge me stroking her leg or anything. All she wanted to do was play mariokart it seemed like. When I started complaining, she said that sometimes she feels like she doesn't know me and that she feels like we have way different takes on how a relationship should be. 

She had to go home and we didn't finish the conversation, but I told her we need to talk about this face to face and not over messaging and she said okay. The problem with that is, she never has any time to talk face to face because she is in color guard at her school, but I was willing to wait until she did have time.

The next day, I tried talking to her over messaging, not about anything just a "Hey, How was your day?" and she blew me off. She said she had too much homework so she couldn't talk to me. I said, "Okay, sorry, but real quick, can I pick you up from school tomorrow?" and she said, "I have things I need to do tomorrow, sorry".

I said, "What about our relationship though? We really need to talk." and that's where she said, "grades go out Friday, my education and eligibility for color guard are more of a priority right now".

I haven't talked to her since then. Should I give her some space? What should I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 4 months says education is more important than our relationship. I feel like she's prioritizing her school stuff over me and our relationship. Should I give her space or what?

**Comments:**

* "Give her space. It sounds like she's not prioritizing your relationship and it's not healthy for you to be in a relationship where you're not a priority."
* "I would say that you're not a priority to her right now, and that's okay. But it's not okay that she's not communicating with you or making time for you. You deserve better than that."
* "I think you should have a calm and rational conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you understand that school is important, but that you feel like you're being neglected and that it's affecting your relationship."
* "I would say that you're not ready for a relationship. You're still young and you need to focus on your own education and personal growth before you can commit to someone else."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on your own priorities and what you want out of a relationship. Are you willing to compromise and make time for her school stuff, or do you want her to prioritize you? You need to figure out what you want and communicate that to her."
* "I would say that you should give her space, but also make it clear that you're not going anywhere. You deserve to be in a relationship where you're a priority, and if she's not willing to make time for you, then maybe it's not the right relationship for you."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling, but also be prepared for the possibility that she may not be willing to change. You need to think about what you're willing to accept in a relationship and what you're not."

TITLE: Me [18 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] one year, I am paying for a vacation that turned out to be more expensive than I thought.

POST: I have been with my fantastic boyfriend for one year. He is amazing, I am pretty sure I love him even though I have not told him yet. Months ago I bought tickets for my friend and I to go to portland in August because they were so cheap. Turns out my friend can't get the time off and the tickets are non-refundable so I ask my boyfriend if he would wanna go and I say I'll pay for his plane ticket. He says he "would love to go with me". Well my boyfriend doesn't have a job right now so I feel bad making him pay for half the hotel room, I tell him I will pay for the hotel room all three nights without thinking. Now things are going to cost me at least $850. I just keep thinking he has not told me he loves me either, for some reason I just can't stop thinking about the fact he probably would not spend $850 on me. I feel like a fool for spending so much on him. I am worried I am going to start resenting him over this. I don't even know how to approach the situation or what I want my end game to be.

TL;DR: I bought tickets to Portland for my friend, but they can't go. I asked my boyfriend to join me and I'll pay for his plane ticket. He said yes, but now I'm realizing the hotel room will cost me $850. I'm worried I'll start resenting him for not contributing to the cost. I don't know how to approach this or what I want to happen.

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you're being way too hard on yourself. You're showing your boyfriend that you're willing to make sacrifices for him, and that's a beautiful thing. Just relax and enjoy the trip with him. You can always talk to him about your feelings and concerns when you get back."
* "I think you're overthinking this. You're not expecting him to pay for the whole trip, just his plane ticket. You're being generous and that's what relationships are about. Don't worry about what he would or wouldn't spend on you, focus on the fact that you're doing something nice for him."
* "I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Let him know that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the cost and that you're worried about resenting him. He might not even realize how you're feeling and it could bring you closer together."
* "You're not a fool for spending money on your boyfriend. You're showing him that you care about him and want to make him happy. Just make sure to communicate with him about your feelings and boundaries. And hey, you might even have a great time on the trip and create some amazing memories together!"
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on this one trip. It's just a vacation, it's not a test of your relationship. Relax, enjoy the trip, and don't worry about what your boyfriend would or wouldn't spend on you. You're doing something nice for him, and that's what matters."

TITLE: I'm [18M] going to a party where an old middle school crush [17F] is also going.

POST: Story time! Back in the summer after 8th grade, I hung out with my group of friends everyday for the whole summer. There was this girl in the group and I really liked her. Like I had the biggest and dumbest crush on her. I was only 13 so I didn't know shit, but I was thinking she's perfect for me, I gotta marry her and all this dumb stuff. The puppy love was so strong I wanted to be a part of her life and I wanted her to be a part of my life. I never had the courage to ask her out, and we went to different high schools. Eventually we stopped talking but during high school I never really liked anyone else. Every other girl felt dull compared to her. I still get nostalgic thinking about her and what would've been different if I had the balls to ask her out. Anyway I'm going to a party this Friday and I heard she's coming. I honestly don't know what to do to so this goes great and eventually ends up in a relationship.

TL;DR: I'm going to a party where my old middle school crush is going and I don't know what to do to make it a good time and potentially end up in a relationship.

COMMENT 1:
Dude, you're 18 now. You're a grown man. Stop thinking about what could've been and focus on the present. Just be yourself, have fun, and see where things go. Don't overthink it. You're not 13 anymore, you don't have to be nervous around her. Just chill and enjoy the party.

COMMENT 2:
I'm a girl and I've been in a similar situation before. My advice is to be genuine and authentic. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. Just be yourself and see if you have any real connection. And don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out. It's okay to have a crush and it's okay if it doesn't end up being a relationship.

COMMENT 3:
Dude, you're thinking about this way too much. Just go to the party, have a good time, and see what happens. Don't put too much pressure on it. You're not going to get anywhere by overthinking it. Just relax and enjoy the moment. And who knows, maybe you'll have a great time and maybe you'll even end up with your crush. But either way, you'll have a good story to tell.

COMMENT 4:
I think you should try to talk to her and see if you have any common interests or hobbies. That way you can have something to talk about and see if you have a connection. But don't be too pushy or aggressive. Just be friendly and see where things go. And remember, it's okay if it doesn't work out. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you.

COMMENT 5:
Dude, you're 18 and you're still thinking about your middle school crush? Get over it. You're an adult now, you should be focusing on your own life and your own relationships. Don't waste your time thinking about someone who's probably moved on with her life. Just go to the party, have a good time, and forget about it. You'll be fine.

TITLE: Apparently I want to sleep with my two best girl friends who I can never touch.

POST: Sorry, title sounded a little awkward but I guess it makes sense. So basically the other night the girl I've been sleeping with (call her F) regularly comes over and stays over, we have sex and then pass out before we have class the next day.

I have a really hard time sleeping, especially staying asleep, and so a lot of times I'll wake up, but F is a really sound sleeper and it never really bothers her. I remember waking up at least twice, and both times F was snuggled next to me, her head on my chest, but when I looked at her, it wasn't her. 

I'm in a fraternity and so we have sweethearts who are some of our best friends, but one of the things is that we absolutely CANNOT sleep with them or have sexual or romantic intimacy, since that would put the relationship between the girl and the entire chapter at risk. BUT, both times I woke up, I saw a different girl. Two of our sweethearts (call them S and B) both have a lot of physical similarities to F, all short brunettes who are cute, and so somewhere along the line of waking up I saw first B, then S, instead of F when I woke up. 

I loved it. I like F a lot, but we're just keeping things casual so we're not in a serious relationship or anything, but I spend so much time around S and B as friends, with no romantic or sexual stuff between us (except one time with S before she was a sweetheart). But, I can't act on the feelings I have towards either one, which is that some days I feel as though I might be in love with one or two of my best friends, and that maybe the girl that would be perfect for me is standing right there, and I can't do anything about it.

I just wanted to tell someone this, because obviously if I tell any of my brothers/other sweethearts shit might hit the fan and people would look at me differently.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my two best girl friends, but I can't act on them because of the rules of my fraternity. I'm torn between my feelings for them and my current relationship with F.

---

This post is a great example of the complexities of human emotions and the challenges of navigating relationships. The author is struggling with feelings for two of their best friends, who are also sweethearts of their fraternity, and is torn between their current relationship with F and their feelings for S and B.

The post highlights the difficulties of keeping emotions in check, especially when they are strong and intense. The author is aware that acting on their feelings would put their relationships with their friends and fraternity at risk, but they are also struggling to suppress their emotions and move on.

The post also raises questions about the nature of relationships and the boundaries that are set within them. The author's fraternity has rules that prohibit romantic or sexual relationships with sweethearts, but the author is struggling with feelings that go beyond friendship. This highlights the complexity of human emotions and the need for open and honest communication in relationships.

Overall, this post is a great example of the challenges of navigating relationships and the importance of self-awareness and honesty in dealing with emotions. It also highlights the importance of setting boundaries and respecting the relationships that we have with others.

TITLE: I [28F] want to do something nice for my boyfriend [26M].

POST: I've been a real pill this semester, cause my stress levels have been through the roof with schoolwork. My boyfriend has been nothing but amazing: giving me time to study when I need it, helping me figure something out when I'm in tears, and just being super supportive. He recently went to PAX East and got a book signed for me (I didn't ask him to and didn't know he was doing this) because I was really sad that I couldn't go. I really want to do something nice for him, but I'm having a hard time thinking of ideas...my head is too full of school things ;-;

About him: physics phd student, loves biking and running, (and forces himself to swim), enjoys reading (favorite book is The Name of the Wind), watching neflix, and casual gamer.

I don't have a whole heck of a lot of money, since I'm in school full time, but I do work too, so I can spend a bit on this. Maybe like ~$100? Spring break is in a week, and we live about an hour north of Boston!

Give me your fun ideas!!

TL;DR: I want to do something nice for my boyfriend, who has been super supportive and understanding during a stressful semester. I have a budget of ~$100 and we live near Boston. Help me come up with ideas!

TITLE: My [24M] girlfriend [20F] has depression and refuses to get a job.

POST: So I am stuck and dont know what to do. Im not asking for a solution im just asking for your opinion.

I have been seeing this girl for about 6 months now and it started out well. She was unemployed and actively seeking employment and living a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise. She is a nice girl and my freinds like her and get along with her well.

She had a previous relationship that ended badly and she got abused by her partner. She is on heavy medication to treat her depression and sometimes will cry for hours for absolutly no reason. I do my best to comfort her but it is hard for me to understand how it feels as i have never really felt bad depression.

I have been helping her look for work but now she doesn't even try. She has done self harm in the past and has bad scarring up her left arm. She has also stopped exercising and gained weight but she is still the kind person she was when i first met her.

I have talked to her about work and exersise and she gets upset when i mention her weight and just says she is still looking when i ask about work. She texts me at least 40 - 50 times everyday when im at work because she is bored. She says things like "promise you wont leave me" and "i dont know what i would do without you" things like that a lot.

I have tried talking to her parents aswell but they baby her too much and wont push her to do anything which i think may be the cause of the problem.

If she is away from me for more than 2 days she gets upset and depressed. It is starting to affect my personal and work life but i am honestly scared she will harm herself or go off her meds if i break up with her. To be honest i dont want to break up beacause i like her a lot. I only want to help her but how can i do this if she wont help herself?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has depression, refuses to get a job, and is self-destructive. I want to help her but she won't help herself. I'm stuck and don't know what to do.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I'm not a professional, but it sounds like your girlfriend is in a very vulnerable state. It's great that you care about her, but you can't fix her depression or her lack of motivation. You can't make her take her meds or get a job. What you can do is support her in seeking professional help. Encourage her to see a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression and trauma. You can also support her in finding a job or volunteering that she's interested in. But ultimately, you can't force her to do anything she's not willing to do. You need to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being."
2. **depressed_and_lonely**: "I'm a person with depression and I can tell you that it's not about being lazy or unmotivated. It's about feeling like you're stuck in a never-ending cycle of sadness and hopelessness. It's about feeling like you're a burden to others and that you're not good enough. It's about feeling like you're all alone in the world. I'm not saying that your girlfriend's behavior is okay, but I am saying that you need to try to understand what she's going through. You need to try to be patient and compassionate. You need to try to help her find ways to manage her depression and find joy in her life again."
3. **relationship_coach**: "It sounds like your girlfriend is in a state of emotional dependence on you. She's using you as a crutch to avoid dealing with her depression and her lack of motivation. You need to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You can't be her therapist or her parent. You can't fix her problems or make her happy. What you can do is be a supportive partner who encourages her to seek help and find her own happiness. You can't do the work for her, but you can be there to support her as she works through her issues."
4. **concerned_citizen**: "I'm not a professional, but it sounds like your girlfriend is in a very dangerous situation. She's self-harming, she's not taking her meds, and she's not seeking help. You need to get her to a hospital or a crisis center ASAP. You can't fix her depression or her lack of motivation, but you can get her the help she needs. You need to prioritize her safety and well-being above all else."
5. **realistic_realist**: "It sounds like your girlfriend is in a state of emotional crisis. She's not taking care of herself, she's not seeking help, and she's not motivated to change. You can't fix her problems or make her happy. What you can do is be a supportive partner who encourages her to seek help and find her own happiness. You can't do the work for her, but you can be there to support her as she works through her issues. You need to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You can't be her therapist or her parent. You can't fix her problems or make her happy. What you can do is be a supportive partner who encourages her to seek help and find her own happiness."

TITLE: Me [22m] decided to break up with my girlfriend[22f] and I don't know if it's a good moment

POST: I wrote a post yesterday explaining that I want to break up my 4 years relationship.

I said that I don't feel the same, because she hates my friends and she is living miles away from me because she doesn't have money to stay in the city to continue her degree.

Today she has failed an exam and she is coming next monday to see it.

Is it a good moment to speak about my feelings?

I'm not sure if it's the right moment but I don't know when I'm going to be face to face with her again. It could be months.

I need advice.

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years, she's coming to see me next monday after failing an exam. Is it a good moment to talk about my feelings?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: "Honestly, I think it's better to have this conversation when she's not going through a tough time like failing an exam. You don't want to add to her stress and make her feel like you're taking advantage of her vulnerability. Maybe wait until she's had some time to process her exam results and is in a better headspace?"
2. **relationship_advisor**: "I agree with throwaway12345. It's not the best idea to bring up the breakup when she's already feeling down. You could consider having a conversation with her when she's feeling more stable and can have a more rational discussion. Remember, this is a big change for both of you, and you want to approach it with empathy and understanding."
3. **confused22**: "I'm in a similar situation and I think it's better to be honest with her. If you're not feeling the same, it's better to say it now rather than leading her on. Just make sure you're respectful and kind when you have the conversation. Remember, she's going through a tough time and she needs your support."
4. **skeptical_sam**: "I think you're being a bit selfish here. You're breaking up with her, and then you're worried about the timing? You should be thinking about how this is going to affect her, not just yourself. Maybe you should be more considerate of her feelings and wait until she's in a better place to have this conversation."
5. **heartbroken_hannah**: "I went through a similar situation and I can tell you that it's better to be honest and direct. Don't beat around the bush or try to sugarcoat it. Just be kind and respectful, and make sure you're prepared for the consequences. Remember, it's okay to hurt someone's feelings, but it's not okay to lead them on or string them along."

TITLE: I'm stuck with what happened tonight. I don't know what to think. (This is all over the place, I'm sorry.)

POST: I'm 32/F he's 29/M, together 1 year friends for 2 before that off and on. My guy we'll call Luke and I went to our first pregnancy appointment today. I'm about 6 weeks. We've had a crazy day with his car not working right, supposed to be fixed but the hood flew up and crashed into the windshield while on the highway. Took it to his mechanic and we got another car to get home in. 

On our way to my place there's this stray cat in the road and it darts back across the street in front of the car. Luke doesn't even brake or swerve to miss it. We've talked about moving in together but he doesn't want my cats to come along. He's never had indoor pets or much of pets while growing up. Cats have been my companions all my life. My first pregnancy 9 years ago I went it alone and because of where I was living I had to give up my cats then to have the baby, alone. I gave them up. It wasn't feasible then. So here we go again. He wants me to give them up because he doesn't want inside pets. My Harley has food allergies and is racking up lots of debt for me with health problems and expensive cat foods. Mallory can be obnoxious sometimes. 

He lives with his parents has for 7 years now. I have my own apartment and bills and such. He's never had to be responsible or adult until now. He won't have a civilized conversation about keeping the baby or not. Is this really a good choice, what's the right answer? He says we can do it but the cats have to go. Even then he still wants to maintain two apartments. I get SSI Disability and am looking for work. He has a stable job. We need each other to do this right. But his lack of empathy tonight with the stray cat leaves me feeling scared of him. 

Any advice? This is my first time having a partner to have a baby with but I feel like I'm doing all the sacrificing.

TL;DR: I'm 6 weeks pregnant with my boyfriend Luke, we've been together 1 year. He doesn't want my cats to come with us when we move in together, which is a big deal for me. He's never had indoor pets and doesn't want the responsibility. He's also not willing to have a civilized conversation about keeping the baby or not. He's never had to be responsible or adult until now. I'm feeling scared and unsure about our future together.

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like Luke is being really unreasonable and inconsiderate. Have you talked to him about how his lack of empathy towards the stray cat makes you feel? Maybe he's not aware of the impact his actions have on you."
* "I think you need to have a serious conversation with Luke about your concerns and boundaries. It's not okay for him to dismiss your feelings and needs like this. You deserve someone who is willing to work with you and compromise."

TITLE: When did NC start working for you?

POST: first love [24m] and I [20f] broke up 9 months ago but only decided to initiate strict NC 3 weeks ago. I still think about him and miss him constantly and I know he's been seeing another girl so that makes it about 100 times worse. I lost a lot of my social circle due to the breakup so I'm alone a lot while he's with good friends all the time. I just feel crappy a lot and constantly have this lingering pain and him in the back of my mind and I'm scared it'll never go away. Can someone share some personal stories of hardship so I feel less alone? Will NC eventually do what it's supposed to at some point. I don't feel much different now than I did when we initiated it.

TL;DR: broke up 9 months ago, initiated NC 3 weeks ago, still think about ex constantly, feeling lonely and crappy, scared it'll never go away. Need some reassurance and personal stories of hardship.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar situation a few years ago and it took me about 6 months to start feeling like I was moving on. It's hard to believe, but NC does eventually get easier. It's like your brain is relearning how to not think about the other person all the time. It's not easy, but it's possible. Hang in there, and try to focus on yourself and your own healing.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar situation and it took me about a year to start feeling like I was over my ex. The key for me was to focus on building a new social circle and finding new hobbies. It's hard to do at first, but it's worth it. Also, try to avoid social media and don't stalk your ex. It's not worth the pain and stress.
3. **u/sadgirl23**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar situation and it took me about 9 months to start feeling like I was moving on. The hardest part for me was the loneliness. I felt like I was the only one who was still hurting. But I found that talking to friends and family and sharing my feelings with them really helped. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to feel like you're stuck. Just remember that you're not alone, and that it will get better with time.
4. **u/ncsurvivor**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar situation and it took me about 12 months to start feeling like I was over my ex. The key for me was to focus on self-care and self-love. I started taking yoga classes, reading books, and spending time with friends and family. It's hard to do at first, but it's worth it. Also, try to avoid comparing yourself to others. Everyone's healing process is different, and it's okay if it takes you longer to move on.
5. **u/throwaway456789**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through a similar situation and it took me about 18 months to start feeling like I was over my ex. The hardest part for me was the guilt. I felt like I was the one who was wronged, and that my ex was the one who was moving on. But I found that talking to friends and family and sharing my feelings with them really helped. It's okay to feel guilty, but it's not worth holding onto. Just remember that you're not alone, and that it will get better with time.

**This post and its comments provide a supportive and empathetic space for the OP to share their feelings and concerns about their situation. The commenters offer personal stories of hardship and provide reassurance that NC does eventually get easier with time. They also offer practical advice on how to cope with the loneliness and pain, such as focusing on self-care, building a new social circle, and avoiding social media. The post and comments demonstrate the importance of community and support in the healing process.**

POST: I love my girlfriend dearly, but she has kids and I have no children of my own.  I don't feel like I'm right for fatherhood, I'm a very irritable person.  I feel she wants to get married and settle down, and because of her age it's fairly important to her.  I'm not ready for this, or to be strongly tied to anything.  The only thing stopping me is the guilt, I love her and fear I might crush her... and make her jaded, emtionally insecure for future relationships.  Am I being weak? Am I being to considerate?  Will she be OK?  I appreciate any advice, thanks redditors

TL;DR: I'm 26, in a 20-month relationship with a 36-year-old woman who has kids. I love her, but I'm not ready for marriage and kids. I'm feeling guilty about breaking up with her, but I don't think I'm right for fatherhood. I'm seeking advice on whether I'm being weak or considerate.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you're being considerate, but also a bit selfish. You need to think about what's best for you, but also what's best for her and her kids. Have an honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It's okay to admit that you're not ready for marriage and kids, but you need to be prepared for the potential consequences of your decision."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being weak because you're letting guilt hold you back from making a decision that's best for you. You need to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, even if it means hurting someone you care about. It's not selfish to want what's best for yourself. Have a conversation with her and be honest about your feelings, but don't let guilt dictate your decision."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I think you're being considerate, but also a bit naive. You can't control how she feels or reacts to your decision. She may be hurt, angry, or disappointed, but you can't change that. What you can do is be honest with her, apologize for any pain you may cause, and move forward with your decision. Remember that you can't stay in a relationship that's not right for you just to avoid hurting someone else."
4. **u/heartbroken_hippie**: "I think you're being weak because you're not willing to take a chance on love and commitment. You're letting fear and uncertainty hold you back from experiencing the joy and fulfillment that comes with building a life with someone. You need to take a leap of faith and trust that things will work out. Have a conversation with her and be honest about your feelings, but don't let fear dictate your decision."

TITLE: Me (21F) with my boyfriend (22M) of four years, in love but I have an intense fantasy of having sex with a woman.

POST: at the start of my four year relationship, I thought I was completely straight, realised I was also attracted to females, but never had any desire to experiment. as I became more sexually experienced I realised I wanted to have sex with a girl. it's something that has been on my mind for about 2 years and I can't seem to get over the fantasy. 

my boyfriend knows about this, though probably not aware of how strong my desire is. I don't think I could go my whole life without doing it, I mean i could, but I would definitely feel like I am missing out on something. it's started to affect how satisfied I am with my relationships sex life (we still have sex frequently, and I enjoy it, but I find my mind wandering to how it would feel if it were a girl). 

my boyfriend has actually said he would be okay with me doing it, and thinks it would be hot. he's even suggested a threesome (not sure I could do that) or him just watching me with another girl. I'm more inclined to the latter option, but if the girl was willing to include him in it as well, I might consider it, although the idea is a bit nerve wracking for me.

so my question is, is it possible to explore your sexuality outside the relationship without damaging it, and if so, how would I even go about finding someone that would agree to sleep with me (us), no strings attached, possibly have my boyfriend watch or join in?

TL;DR: I'm a 21F in a 4-year relationship with a 22M. I have a strong fantasy of having sex with a woman. My boyfriend knows and is open to it, but I'm unsure how to explore this without damaging our relationship or finding someone willing to do it with no strings attached.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's great that your boyfriend is open to it. It's not every day you find someone who is willing to explore your desires with you. Have you considered talking to him about what you're looking for in terms of boundaries and what you're comfortable with? It might help you both feel more secure and on the same page."
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with yourself and your partner about your desires. It's not always easy to admit to ourselves what we want, let alone share it with someone else. Have you considered online platforms or apps that connect people looking for similar experiences? It might be a good way to find someone who is also open to exploring their sexuality."
* "I'm a bit surprised that your boyfriend is okay with it, but I guess that's a good thing. Have you considered talking to him about what you're looking for in terms of a threesome or him watching you with another girl? It might be good to get his thoughts on it and see if you're both on the same page."
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with yourself and your partner about your desires. It's not always easy to admit to ourselves what we want, let alone share it with someone else.

TITLE: Do I [20 M] tell my SO [20 F] that she has gained weight?

POST: Let me preface this by stating that I have nothing at all against fat people. It's a body shape like any other and should be respected as such.

That being said, both my girlfriend and I would prefer to stay in shape. About a year ago we agreed that if one of us were to even start putting on weight, the other would let them know. Well, over the past few months she has been getting a little heavier. Nothing crazy or off-putting by any means (I'm attracted to her regardless) but I can't help but think about when we made that promise. 

We're very close and communicate well but she can get rather emotional sometimes so hurting her is the last thing I want to do. She mentioned to me that her mom had just recently commented on her weight and she (my SO) seemed pretty offended. 

For background and to preemptively answer some comments that may pop up: We don't live very close to each other and have relatively busy schedules so asking her to join me at the gym would be difficult. She's active through other activities but her diet isn't great.

Should I say something? If I did, how would I bring it up?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has gained weight, we made a promise to tell each other if one of us gained weight, but I'm worried about hurting her feelings.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns, but not necessarily about her weight. Instead, focus on your shared goal of staying in shape and how you can support each other in achieving that. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that we've both been a bit more relaxed with our diets and exercise routines lately. I was thinking we could work together to get back on track and support each other in our fitness goals.' This approach focuses on your shared goal and doesn't single her out or make her feel like you're criticizing her appearance."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're overthinking this. If you're genuinely concerned about your girlfriend's health and well-being, then you should have a conversation with her about it. However, you need to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Avoid making comments that are judgmental or critical, and instead focus on expressing your concerns and offering support. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that you've been gaining weight and I'm worried about your health. I want to support you in getting back on track and feeling your best. Can we work together to find a solution that works for you?'"
3. **u/skeptical_skeptic**: "I think you're making a mistake by even considering bringing this up. You're not going to change your girlfriend's weight or habits by telling her about it, and you're likely to hurt her feelings and damage your relationship. Instead, focus on your own health and well-being, and let your girlfriend make her own decisions about her body. If you're really concerned about her health, then you should be having a conversation with her about it in a way that's supportive and non-judgmental, rather than focusing on her appearance."
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns, but you need to approach it in a way that's respectful and empathetic. Avoid making comments that are judgmental or critical, and instead focus on expressing your concerns and offering support. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that you've been gaining weight and I'm worried about your health. I want to support you in getting back on track and feeling your best. Can we work together to find a solution that works for you?' Remember, the goal of the conversation should be to support your girlfriend and help her feel her best, not to criticize her appearance or make her feel bad about herself."

TITLE: I am just so confused

POST: So last month at a party for my grandma's birthday, my grandma says there is this girl that she wants me to meet.  I'm apprehensive because my grandma is famous for setting my brother up on a date with a one armed girl. No offense to the one armed ladies out there, it just took my brother by surprise.  I also haven't dated much (read: at all), but I finally got a handle on some major depression and anxiety that has ruined my life for the past 10 years, so I agree to meet her.

So we go on a few dates, and awesomely enough she is not only cute as hell but fun to talk to and hang out with.  I have an awesome time, and as far as I can tell she has a great time too.  Couple of days after we last get together she asks if we can put off getting together again while she hunts for a job.  I say of course, because that seems pretty understandable to me.  

I text her a few times, asking how the hunt was going, or seeing if she had time to get dinner blah blah.  Didn't ever hear anything back.  5 weeks go by, don't hear anything.  O well, she is either still on the job hunt, or just not interested I suppose.  Then this morning I get back from the gym to see she accepted a facebook friend request I sent her a long time ago.  According to my notifications, she accepted the request, liked some status I made yesterday, then unfriended me.

So I write this to repeat that cliché of I don't understand women.  Also, I'm letting facebook news bother me, so that's pretty cool too!

TL;DR: I met a girl through my grandma, had a great time, then she stopped responding, and now she's friending me on facebook and then unfriending me. I'm confused.

TITLE: Reddit, where the hell should I get married? Help!

POST: * My fiance and I live 300 miles apart; he lives in St. Louis, and I live in Alabama. 

* In seven months, I'll be moving to live with him permanently.

* Our tentative date for the wedding is May 2013. 

* We have no idea where to have the wedding. 

I'd been leaning towards having it in St. Louis, since by the time of the wedding, I'll have been living there for a year. Also, the city has more of a "party" atmosphere in general. Many people in the South (parts of my family included) can be a little uptight when it comes to alcohol. I want the wedding to be a drunken celebration, and I want to attract a fun crowd.

My mom really wants me to have it here in Alabama, because she thinks most of my family won't be able to afford to go if we have it in St. Louis. She says it's customary to have the wedding where the bride's family lives. 

Another argument she has is that my family is much larger than my fiance's, so I have more people to accommodate. She tells me to have the wedding where I want, but I know she'll guilt me forever if I don't have it here.

I wouldn't mind having it in Alabama, but I think it would make planning harder. I would love to have my family/friends to be able to come, but I also want *his* family/friends to come too.

My fiance is little help and doesn't have a strong opinion either way. His parents aren't picky where the wedding is either.

I've asked others for their opinions, but I was hoping that maybe Reddit can provide some magical answer that I haven't thought of yet. Or maybe some insight I haven't yet considered.

TL;DR: I'm torn between having my wedding in St. Louis (where I'll be living) or Alabama (where my family is). I want a party atmosphere, but also want to include my family and his family. Help me decide!*

---

**Reddit's Response:**

* Many users agree that the bride should have the wedding where she wants, considering she'll be living in St. Louis soon.
* Some users suggest having a destination wedding in a neutral location, such as a beach town or a mountain resort, to accommodate both families and create a unique experience.
* Others recommend having a small, intimate ceremony in St. Louis and a larger reception in Alabama to please both families.
* A few users suggest having a "split" wedding, where the ceremony is in St. Louis and the reception is in Alabama, or vice versa.
* Some users advise the bride to prioritize her own happiness and not let her mom's guilt trips dictate the decision.
* A few users share their own experiences with having weddings in different locations and offer words of encouragement.

**The Bride's Follow-up Post:**

* She thanks the Reddit community for their input and shares that she's decided to have the wedding in St. Louis, considering it will be her new home and she wants to start her new life there.
* She mentions that she'll have a small, intimate ceremony and a larger reception to accommodate both families.
* She thanks Reddit again for their help and says she feels more confident in her decision.

This post showcases the power of online communities in providing advice and support. The bride's dilemma is relatable, and the Reddit community offers a range of perspectives and solutions. The post also highlights the importance of prioritizing one's own happiness and not letting external pressures dictate decisions. Ultimately, the bride makes an informed decision that works best for her and her fiancé.

TITLE: Hey r/jobs, I need some advice on an upcoming promotion!

POST: First off let me say that I love my job.  I get to do what I love, in a killer place, but I don't really make a lot of money considering the field I'm in.  I work in a non-profit museum institution doing video production, and AV technical support as a secondary element to the job.  My salary is barely ok for an entry level position in my field (~30K), even though the work I've been doing up until this point is quite beyond entry level imo, but that's neither here nor there.  

My predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.  While I agree I do want to keep making creative videos, I'm weary that they're going to try and dump his work load (relatively little in comparison) on top of mine with a minimal raise.  There is very much a rank non-profit culture here, very top heavy, and upward mobility is notoriously difficult (just as a caveat to anyone who might understand the particulars).  

And so my question is, how do I figure out in a cordial and non-confrontational way how much is fair for them to offer me for the promotion with additional responsibilities?  I realize I could just ask my current boss how much he's making but that doesn't seem proper or legit, plus he's been here for 20 years so they can always pull the seniority card.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!

TL;DR: I'm being offered a promotion to manage AV at a non-profit museum, but I'm worried about the workload and potential lack of a fair raise. How can I figure out a fair salary for the new role without being confrontational or asking my current boss's salary?

---

This post is a great example of how to ask for advice on a promotion in a respectful and professional manner. The OP (original poster) has done their research and has a clear understanding of their current situation, including their salary and the responsibilities they're being asked to take on. They're also aware of the potential pitfalls of asking for a raise and are looking for advice on how to approach the situation in a cordial and non-confrontational way.

The OP is asking for specific advice on how to determine a fair salary for the new role, and is open to suggestions on how to approach the conversation with their employer. They're also willing to share their concerns and thoughts on the situation, which shows that they're proactive and willing to take the initiative to advocate for themselves.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to ask for advice on a promotion, and it's likely to receive helpful and relevant responses from the community.

TITLE: [16/m] I can't decide whether or not I should break up with my partner [16/f]

POST: I've been debating on the topic on if I should end my relationship. I'm not sure if what I feel for (let's call her Kelly) Kelly is genuine love, yet I have a strong feeling that it really is. Perhaps it's just because I'm going through high school and this is just the result of raging developing testosterone, but I digress. The kicker is that Kelly is near-depressed and mainly relies on me for emotional and moral support because of her abusive family and she can be self-abusive if she reaches a certain point of sadness (Note: when we broke up before it was because of her abusive father getting mad at her and out of emotion she broke up with me since I didn't come to offend her. In retrospect, she felt guilty about it and decided to re-start our relationship. She said she became a shut-in and didn't eat for two days, looking back that seemed somewhat ridiculous.) I feel like she also expects too much of a person like me with no type of job and her unneeded materialistic ideals are malicious to both my psyche and my bank account (I have no job). More and more, we are having arguments and fights starting for no apparent reason; just earlier today she got angry at me since I decided to hang out with my friends instead of her (but I was going to see her in a few days anyways). I also feel like that she'll become terminally depressed since she tends to be over-dramatic about things and do dangerous things to herself... I care for her, but her security, well-being, and health may be in danger if I end our relationship. Please respond, Reddit.

TL;DR: 16-year-old guy unsure if he should break up with his 16-year-old girlfriend who has depression and relies on him for emotional support. He feels like she expects too much and is worried about her well-being if they break up.

RESPONSES:

* "Dude, you're 16. You don't know what love is yet. You're still figuring out who you are and what you want. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. If you're not happy in the relationship, it's okay to end it. You can't pour from an empty cup, and it sounds like you're being drained. Prioritize yourself, and if you still feel the same way after some time, then maybe it's worth re-evaluating the relationship." - u/throwaway123456789
* "I'm not a relationship expert, but it sounds like Kelly is in a really tough spot. If she's relying on you for emotional support, it's not healthy for either of you. You can't be responsible for her mental health. It's not your job to fix her. If you're feeling drained and unhappy, it's okay to set boundaries or take a step back. Maybe you can encourage her to seek professional help or talk to a trusted adult about her feelings. Remember, you can't save someone from their own struggles. You can only support them." - u/mentalhealthmatters
* "I think you're being really unfair to Kelly. She's going through a tough time, and you're not giving her the support she needs. You're not even giving her the time of day. You're just using her as a crutch because you're not sure what you want. Newsflash: relationships are hard work. If you're not willing to put in the effort, then maybe you shouldn't be in one. Kelly needs someone who can be there for her, not someone who's just going to abandon her when things get tough." - u/kellylover123
* "I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's the truth. You're not ready for a relationship. You're 16, and you're still figuring out who you are. You don't have the emotional maturity to handle the ups and downs of a relationship. Kelly is going through a tough time, and she needs someone who can be there for her, not someone who's going to bail on her when things get tough. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. When you're ready to handle the responsibilities of a relationship, then maybe you can think about getting back into one." - u/relationshipgoals

This post and its responses highlight the complexities of teenage relationships and the challenges of navigating emotional support, personal growth, and responsibility.

? fuck that shit

TL;DR: OP is trolling about women who went to college/university but have low-paying jobs.

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. "Dude, you're not even making sense. What's the point of going to college if you're just going to end up in a low-paying job? Maybe they're just trying to get a degree for personal fulfillment or to get a better job in the future. And by the way, being a cashier or hostess doesn't mean someone is 'dumb'. It's a job, just like any other."
2. "I'm a woman who went to college and now works as a hostess. And you know what? I love my job. I get to meet new people every day, and I get to use my people skills to make sure everyone has a good time. It's not about the money, it's about the experience and the connections I make. And by the way, just because someone has a 'low-paying job' doesn't mean they're not smart or capable. Maybe they're just choosing to prioritize other things in life."
3. "I'm a man who went to college and now works as a cashier. And you know what? I love my job too. I get to interact with customers, and I get to learn new things every day. It's not about the prestige or the money, it's about the sense of accomplishment and the feeling of being part of a team. And by the way, just because someone has a 'low-paying job' doesn't mean they're not smart or capable. Maybe they're just choosing to prioritize other things in life."
4. "I'm a woman who went to college and now works as a software engineer. And you know what? I love my job. I get to use my skills to create something new and innovative, and I get to work with a team of talented people. It's not about the money or the prestige, it's about the sense of fulfillment and the feeling of making a difference. And by the way, just because someone has a 'high-paying job' doesn't mean they're smart or capable. Maybe they're just choosing to prioritize other things in life."
5. "I'm a man who went to college and now works as a teacher. And you know what? I love my job. I get to inspire and educate young minds, and I get to see the impact I have on their lives. It's not about the money or the prestige, it's about the sense of fulfillment and the feeling of making a difference. And by the way, just because someone has a 'low-paying job' doesn't mean they're not smart or capable. Maybe they're just choosing to prioritize other things in life."

The post and the responses highlight the common stereotypes and biases that people have about women and their careers. The OP's post is a classic example of sexism and misogyny, where he is making assumptions about women based on their education and occupation. The responses, on the other hand, challenge these stereotypes and highlight the diversity of women's experiences and choices. They also emphasize the importance of not making assumptions about someone based on their job or education, and the need to respect and appreciate people for who they are, regardless of their background or career choices.

TITLE: I [15 M] was broken up with by my Girlfriend [15 F] after only dating for a month, friends act like I should feel bad

POST: I dated this girl for only a month, and she broke up with me because she decided she might be a lesbian. We've only been broken up with for a little over a week now, and I've accepted it since it wasn't for that long and we broke up on good terms

However, everyone acts like I should be completely heartbroken. She was my first girlfriend and I did really like her, but I'm nowhere near as bothered by it as people think I should be. I keep hearing people say I need to take time out to find myself and that I'm rushing things by wanting to find someone else now.

 Is it really wrong for me to move on so soon, or am I just doing things at my own pace?

TL;DR: I was broken up with by my first girlfriend after a month, and everyone thinks I should be devastated. But I'm not really feeling that bad, and I'm considering moving on. Is it wrong for me to do so, or am I just doing things at my own pace?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 15. You're still figuring out who you are. Take some time to focus on yourself and don't rush into anything. You're young, you've got your whole life ahead of you." - u/throwaway123456
* "I think it's great that you're not dwelling on the breakup. You're right, it was only a month and you guys broke up on good terms. If you're feeling ready to move on, then go for it! Just make sure you're not rebounding and that you're actually taking the time to get to know someone new." - u/sarcastic_sally
* "I think you're being really mature about this. It's not uncommon for people to move on quickly after a breakup, especially if it was a short-term relationship. Just make sure you're not ignoring your feelings or using someone new as a distraction. Take things slow and get to know someone new before jumping into anything serious." - u/relationship_advisor
* "I think you should take some time to process your emotions and figure out what you want. It's okay to feel upset, even if it was a short-term relationship. You're still learning about yourself and what you want in a relationship. Don't rush into anything and make sure you're doing it for the right reasons." - u/sad_sack

This post and its comments demonstrate the complexities of relationships and the different perspectives people have on breakups. The OP is trying to move on from his first breakup, but his friends and acquaintances are pressuring him to take more time to grieve and focus on himself. The comments range from encouraging him to take his time and focus on himself to supporting his decision to move on. The post highlights the importance of self-reflection and communication in relationships, as well as the need to respect the other person's feelings and boundaries. It also shows how people's reactions to breakups can vary greatly, and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with heartbreak.

TITLE: Me[25M] with my EX GF [18F] 2 years, We broke up because I flirted with another girl

POST: # Part 1
I'm finding it hard to understand something. My ex GF broke up with me 6 months ago, I tried winning her back for 6 months. We would see each other once every 2 weeks and we'd get on like 2 peas in a pod and she kept leading me on, however 2 days after seeing her she would tell me it was a mistake and that we can't speak anymore. This of course was really unfair and caused me great depression. 

# Part 2
After dealing with this for 6 months I decided to completely cut her out, and I've been doing good by not messaging her anymore. She still messages me almost every 2nd night. I don't get it.. She doesn't want anything to do with me however she still messages me. Surely if someone wanted to cut someone out of their life they wouldn't go through all the trouble of constantly messaging someone? 

# Part 3
I guess what I'm trying to get at is, does anyone have an explanation as to why someone who broke up with me keeps messaging me even after I said goodbye for good? 

Thanks

TL;DR: Ex GF broke up with me 6 months ago because I flirted with another girl. I tried to win her back for 6 months, but she kept leading me on and then would tell me it was a mistake and we can't speak anymore. I've cut her out of my life, but she still messages me almost every 2nd night. I don't understand why she would do this.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like she's still got feelings for you and can't quite let go. She's probably using the messaging as a way to keep a connection with you, even if it's just to torture herself by knowing you're still out there. Don't engage with her, OP. You deserve better than someone who can't respect your boundaries."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, it's possible that she's not trying to win you back, but rather trying to keep you in her life as a way to cope with the breakup. She might be using the messaging as a way to avoid dealing with her own emotions and the fact that she's moved on. You need to prioritize your own healing and well-being. Don't engage with her and focus on building a life without her."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you're overthinking this, OP. She's probably just bored and has nothing better to do. Don't give her the attention she's seeking. You're better off without her."
4. **u/another_user**: "OP, it's possible that she's trying to make you feel guilty for moving on. She might be trying to manipulate you into staying in touch or getting back together. Don't fall for it. You deserve to be happy and move on from this toxic relationship."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're still holding onto this relationship and it's affecting your mental health. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing. Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't respect your boundaries."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are divided, with some users suggesting that the ex GF is still holding onto feelings for the OP and is using the messaging as a way to cope with the breakup, while others think she's just bored and seeking attention. The majority of users agree that the OP should not engage with her and focus on his own healing and well-being. The post highlights the complexities of relationships and the importance of prioritizing one's own mental health and well-being.

TITLE: Me [31F] with my fiance [48M] of 2 years, finding it more and more difficult to work together at our job.

POST: We met at our job, with him being a supervisor and I, an entry level worker. I have worked there for seven years while he has been there for four years. We fell in love quickly and have went strongly together ever since. 

However, a few months ago I was promoted to supervisor, too. I was happy because it meant more money for us to accomplish our goals. I thought he was happy as well. Only now he takes to arguing with me at work and shaming me when I make a mistake or take too long to complete a task. I kindly let him know that I feel he isn't addressing me respectfully and he says nothing in response. 

A few of those blow up times have been in front of other coworkers, which I find embarrassing and unprofessional. The next day, of course, it's like it never happened. 

It makes me feel like a complete failure and my heart breaks every single time because this is the person I love more than anyone else in this world. I don't want our work arguments to affect our relationship together but he literally gets so mad at me he stops talking to me altogether. 

He has been married twice. I'm a late bloomer. This is the first (and I'm hoping the last) long-term relationship I've ever had. So I'm having trouble understanding how someone who loves you can speak so harshly and get mad so quickly for the tiniest things.

TL;DR: Fiance and I work together, he's a supervisor and I'm a supervisor too. We argue at work, he shames me in front of coworkers, and it's affecting our relationship. I don't know how to deal with this.

**Comments:**

* "OP, I think you need to have a serious talk with your fiancé about how his behavior is affecting you and your relationship. It's not okay for him to shame you in front of coworkers or speak harshly to you. You deserve respect and kindness, especially from the person you love."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your fiancé is struggling with his own insecurities and power dynamics. You might want to consider having a mediated conversation with him, or even seeking couples therapy to work through these issues."
* "OP, you're not a failure. You're a strong, capable woman who deserves to be treated with respect. It's not your fault that your fiancé is acting this way. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries with him. Remember, you don't have to tolerate abusive behavior, even if it's from someone you love."
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing that his behavior is affecting your relationship. That's a huge step! Now, you need to take action and communicate your feelings to him. Tell him how his behavior is making you feel and ask him to work on changing it. You deserve a healthy, respectful relationship."
* "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your fiancé is struggling with his own ego and insecurities. You might want to consider having a conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting you, but also be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to change. You deserve better than someone who can't treat you with respect and kindness."

TITLE: Is it too early for me [27m] to buy a plane ticket for my SO [25F] for a major vacation?

POST: So I just met this girl about two months ago and everything has been going great.  We see eachother everyday, common interests everywhere, amazing sex, etc.  Problem is that in about a week, my work is sending me to Japan for 5 months.  I really like this girl, but its obviously unfair for me to expect a long distance relationship this early in the game.  We've both said that we aren't going to be looking for anyone else while I'm gone, but that we can't really apply any labels once I leave.

That being said, my work is not only paying for all of my airfare, but they are also giving me a pretty hefty bonus for going there (about $20,000 plus incidentals and living expenses).  She has toyed with the idea of getting a ticket and coming to visit me, but I know the cost is a big concern (its about $1200-1400 from where we live).

Would it be weird for me to offer to go in on it with her or pay for half or something?  I feel like I'd really like her to come and I know she does too, but I don't want her to feel like I'm pushing too hard this early.

TL;DR: I'm going to Japan for 5 months and I really want my SO to come visit me, but I don't want to put too much pressure on her.  Should I offer to pay for half of her ticket or go in on it with her?

---

**Comments:**

* "It's not too early to show your commitment to her, but it's also not too early to have a conversation about what you both want and expect from each other. Consider having a conversation about what she's comfortable with and what you're willing to do to make it work. It's not about the money, it's about the gesture and the thought behind it." (123 upvotes)
* "I think it's a great idea to offer to help with the cost! It shows that you're willing to put in effort to make this work and that you care about her. Just make sure to have a conversation about it and make sure you're both on the same page." (92 upvotes)
* "I would say it's a bit too early to be offering to pay for half of her ticket. You guys have only been dating for two months, and you're already talking about long-term plans? Take a step back and focus on getting to know each other better before making big commitments like that." (56 upvotes)
* "I think it's a great idea! It's a thoughtful gesture and shows that you're willing to make sacrifices for her. Just make sure to communicate with her about it and make sure she's comfortable with it." (45 upvotes)
* "I would not recommend offering to pay for half of her ticket. It's a big ask, especially considering you've only been dating for two months. You should focus on building a stronger connection with her before making big financial commitments." (32 upvotes)

**Conclusion:**

The majority of commenters agree that it's not too early to show commitment to one's partner, but it's also important to have a conversation about what each person wants and expects from the relationship. Some commenters suggest offering to help with the cost of the ticket as a thoughtful gesture, while others advise against making big financial commitments too early in the relationship. Ultimately, the decision depends on the individual circumstances and what works best for the couple. The OP should consider having an open and honest conversation with their SO to determine what they're both comfortable with.

TITLE: I [20M] have been on two dates with her [20F], she seems very shy and insecure. Should I run?

POST: I met this girl through a friend, and we've been on two (double) dates with two of our very close mutual friends (my best guy friend & female friend are dating, this is my best female friend's friend.) Each time in person she's very quiet and distant with me, and really doesn't talk a whole lot.

I understand some people are naturally shy, and that's okay, but she consistently texts me [very pessimistic things about herself] I'm wondering if I should let it play out, or take the red flags and run. She's otherwise a really nice girl, so I'm a little stuck on what to do.

TL;DR: I've been on two dates with a girl who seems very shy and insecure, consistently texts me negative things about herself, and is quiet in person. Should I keep going or take the red flags and run?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not really interested in you. If she's not opening up to you in person and is only talking to you through texts, it's probably not going anywhere. You deserve someone who is confident and comfortable around you."
* "I think you should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just really nervous around new people or in new situations. If you're interested in getting to know her better, try to have a conversation with her about how she's feeling. Ask her what's going on and if there's anything you can do to make her feel more comfortable."
* "I would say it's a mix of both. She might be shy, but the constant negative self-talk is a red flag. If you're not getting the vibe that she's interested in you, it's okay to move on. You don't want to waste your time on someone who's not going to be happy with themselves, let alone with you."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate what you're looking for in a relationship. If you're looking for someone who is confident and outgoing, this might not be the right match for you. But if you're okay with someone who is a little shy and insecure, then maybe it's worth giving her a chance."
* "I would say it's not worth it. You deserve someone who is confident and happy with themselves. If she's consistently texting you negative things about herself, it's probably a sign that she's not happy with herself and that's not something you want to deal with in a relationship." 

This post is an example of a common relationship dilemma that people face, where they are unsure whether to continue pursuing a relationship with someone who has certain traits or behaviors that may be problematic. In this case, the OP is unsure whether to continue dating someone who is shy and insecure, and who consistently texts him negative things about herself. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from those who think the OP should give the girl a chance and try to understand her better, to those who think the OP should take the red flags and run. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but the comments provide a helpful and supportive space for him to think through his feelings and consider his options. 

The post also highlights some common relationship red flags, such as:

* Consistently negative self-talk
* Shyness or insecurity
* Lack of communication or openness in person
* Only communicating through texts or other forms of indirect communication

These red flags can be indicative of deeper issues in a relationship, and it's important for individuals to be aware of them and consider whether they are willing and able to work through them with their partner. 

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide support and guidance for people navigating complex relationship issues.

TITLE: What are some common misconceptions about women that men often have?

POST: I've been noticing that a lot of my male friends and acquaintances seem to have some pretty strong misconceptions about women. I'm not sure if it's because they've never really taken the time to understand us or if it's just a result of societal conditioning, but I think it's really important to address these misconceptions and promote a more accurate understanding of women.

So, what are some common misconceptions about women that men often have? Are there any specific stereotypes or biases that you've encountered that you think are particularly harmful or inaccurate?

TL;DR: What are some common misconceptions about women that men often have, and how can we work to promote a more accurate understanding of women?

COMMENTS:

* "One common misconception is that all women are emotional and irrational. This is just not true. While it's true that women are often socialized to be more emotional and expressive, this doesn't mean that we're inherently more emotional or irrational than men. It's just a different way of processing emotions and making decisions."
* "I think another common misconception is that women are only interested in relationships and romance. This is just not true. Many women are perfectly happy being single and focusing on their careers or other interests. We're not all just waiting around for a man to come along and sweep us off our feet."
* "I've noticed that a lot of men seem to think that women are naturally more nurturing and caring than men. While it's true that many women do have a strong nurturing instinct, this doesn't mean that men can't be nurturing and caring too. And it's not like women are always more caring and nurturing than men - it's just a different

TITLE: So Reddit, what is the most awkward way you've handled someone asking you out?

POST: So reddit, how have you awkwardly handled being asked out? I think I set the bar pretty high from my awkward and anti-social self:

I was sitting and eating lunch in the cafeteria of my school when a girl I had a huge crush on asked me out. I was super suspicious since I'm known as a smart but nerdy person. I said, "I don't know." and she responded pretty much by saying,"Okay, you can think about it and tell me later" with a surprised look. I was nervous, because I had recently told my friends I liked her, and if I said yes, and it was a prank, then my reputation would be screwed. I ended up saying, "I don't know" for around 3 days when she stopped asking me if I had made up my mind. I still think it was a dare because when I asked, she said it was for "personal reasons". If it was actually genuine, then  I hate myself.

TL;DR: I was asked out by a girl I had a crush on, but I handled it awkwardly by saying "I don't know" for 3 days and then never following up.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, that's not awkward, that's just a solid 'I'm not interested' response. You didn't owe her an answer, and you didn't have to make it weird. Just say no and move on." (u/throwaway1234567)
* "I once asked a girl out and she said 'I need to think about it' and then never responded. I was left wondering if I was even worth considering. You're not alone, OP!" (u/awkwardturtle)
* "I think it's great that you were honest with yourself about your feelings and didn't want to lead her on. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to string someone along. You did the right thing, even if it was awkward." (u/positivevibesonly)
* "I've been in a similar situation where someone asked me out and I said 'I need to think about it' and then never followed up. It's like, come on, just say yes or no already! OP, you're not alone in this awkwardness." (u/sarcastic_sally)
* "I think it's funny that you thought it was a prank. That's a pretty good assumption, though. I've had people ask me out just to see how I'd react, and it's always weird. OP, you handled it well, even if it was awkward." (u/lololololol)

**Reddit's response:** The comments are filled with people sharing their own awkward experiences with being asked out or asking someone out. Many people commiserate with OP's awkwardness, while others offer words of encouragement and advice on how to handle similar situations in the future. The post becomes a lighthearted and relatable discussion about the awkwardness of dating and relationships.

TITLE: I (19/f) live in a different state as my family with my (20/m) husband. Having major issues with my in-laws and Christmas.

POST: Sorry guys, this is going to be all over the place. I'm on my phone and I'm not very good at writing stories. 

I married my high school sweetheart 3 months ago (yay!) And moved out of state to follow him in his travels with the navy. I didn't care to leave because I knew we would always go home for the holidays, and if he couldn't, I would just go home by myself.  I'm very close to my family and would be miserable without visiting! Unfortunately my husband isn't so close with his parents because they're crazy racist. He's white and I'm hispanic. So racist to the point that they won't even allow me in their home. They say the nastiest things about me and the hispanic community to my husband and his younger siblings. My husband always defends me or just walks away. We got married at the courthouse and both of our families were invited to come witness it. All my family showed up and not one person from his even did so much as to call. My family absolutely adores my husband, they're very loving and open. And they of course want us to come stay with them for Christmas. He loves my family, but his parent's want him to stay at their home for Christmas.... Without me. I can't even described how much it hurts that he's actually considering it. Though I understand that he wants to see his younger siblings. I don't want him to go. I want him to come home to my family with me. My home is somewhere  we're both loved and accepted. His family makes me feel like scum and disgusting. Which is crazy because his family is trailor poor/white trash and I come from a very well off and civilized family. 
I feel like it might be selfish and bitchy of me to ask him not to stay there. I know that its his family, but they're so unreasonable. Am I wrong for being hurt and wanting him to come home with me?
Also, other than this we have an awesome marriage. This is basically our only issue. And we've been dealing with it for years.

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old wife living in a different state from my family. My husband's racist parents won't let me in their home and I'm hurt that he's considering staying with them for Christmas without me. I feel like it's selfish to ask him not to go, but I want him to come home with me to my loving and accepting family.

TITLE: How does a college student move states?

POST: To begin, and give context, it seems now two years after graduating high school that I am just sick of where I live. (No this isn't a *wah me* post.) So, I have always had the attitude, that if I don't like something in my life, I want to change it. 

I don't like being around people I grew up with. I am subscribed to my city's subreddit, and it seems that people only talk about where they would rather be, due to extreme heat and lack thereof things to do.

However, now I am asking you redditors for help and to see how you guys have moved on your own.

Beyond actually *deciding* which city I would want to move to, (I have narrowed down my decisions,) I need help on how to finance the move because right now, it seems completely unrealistic for meand it pains me. I feel somewhat trapped here. Now I have the transportation to move, and I could quite possibly put down one months payment on my lease. However, only being a college student, I don't have the experience to be considered for a job that one could just accept via the telephone. I would need an entry level job. It seems I would need a job previously to moving, because I can't spend weeks without pay scrambling to find a job.

I find myself in a catch 22.

I need success stories. Have any of you redditors out there moved all by yourself without the help of affulent parents or have handy tips for me to make my dream a reality?

TL;DR: College student wants to move to a new state, but struggling to finance the move and find a job without experience. Seeking success stories and tips from redditors who have moved on their own.

TITLE: Me (28f), my husband (29m) and his family Christmas Party.

POST: My husband and I have been married for three years.

We moved back to his home town shortly after getting married. One of the downsides to moving to his home town is that we are insanely far from my family, but our job prospects were better there, so we went. He has a very large family of Uncles, Aunts, and cousins galore. All very nice people, no real issues there.

The problem is that they have a yearly Christmas party and I have very bad anxiety issues. The past three years I've sucked it up and gone any ways, ending our visit with very bad panic attacks and my poor husband has had to cart me away back home (not that he complained).

We tried to compromise last year a little bit with going for two hours, but I really felt like I was ruining the party for my husband, who really only sees his family this one time a year, regardless of how close we are.

This year, I said that I'll just stay home and he can go as long as he wants. He's reluctantly agreed but is worried about what to say to his family about my absence. He doesn't like to lie, so he doesn't want to say that I'm home sick, but he also doesn't want to have to explain my anxiety, because thus far his family hasn't put that together yet and they would likely (this is just a guess) say that I should be going any ways to get over it. He doesn't want to argue with them the entire night about the benefits of treatments for anxiety disorders.

So my question is, what should my husband tell them when they ask where I am?

TL;DR: Husband and I have a big family Christmas party coming up, I have severe anxiety issues, and I've decided to stay home this year. Husband is worried about what to tell his family about my absence. Should he tell them the truth, or come up with a different excuse?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, I think your husband should just tell his family the truth. It's not like it's a secret, and it's better to be honest than to come up with some half-baked excuse. He can explain that you're taking care of yourself and that you're not feeling up to attending the party this year. It's okay to prioritize your own mental health, and his family should respect that."
* "I agree with the above comment. Honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to something as important as mental health. Your husband can also offer to send you updates and photos from the party, so you can still feel included even if you're not there in person."
* "I think your husband should tell his family that you're not feeling well, but not specify what's wrong. He can say something like'she's not feeling up to it this year' or'she's not doing well, so we're staying home.' This way, he's not lying, but he's also not having to go into details about your anxiety. It's a delicate balance, but I think this approach could work."
* "I think your husband should be honest with his family, but also offer to Facetime or Skype you in so you can still participate in the party remotely. This way, you can still feel included and connected to your husband and his family, even if you're not there in person."
* "I think your husband should tell his family the truth, but also offer to take some photos and send them to you so you can still feel included. This way, you can still feel like you're a part of the party, even if you're not there in person."

TITLE: Me [18M] and a newly met girl online [22F] What do i do now?

POST: So I recently posted on CL looking to meet with someone new in my area for nothing too serious but something that could develop in the future and I got messaged by a girl who was interested. We Exchanged numbers but have been talking online more. 

Our plan was to get to know eachother and then maybe meet up and go on a date but in the few days we have been in contact she hasn't been engaging me in any convos. I text her and she doesnt respond but does when she is online through skype. I don't know if its a change of heart without telling me or something else but I really want to talk to her more but not come off like im pushing too hard or acting like a stalker.

She initially gave me her number and sent me a photo of what she looks like without me even asking so it doesnt seem like she isn't interested, and when I do initiate a convo she replies to me, but every time I bring up the idea of talking in person or arranging to meet up she seems to either not reply or ignore answering the question, and I cant work out why seeing as our main intention was to meet up!

So what do I do now to get her to talk to me and/or want to meet up without seeming like im being forward?

TL;DR: Girl I met online isn't engaging in convos, only responds when I initiate and doesn't want to meet up. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, it sounds like she's not interested. Don't be too hard on yourself, it happens. Maybe try to have a calm and casual convo with her and see if you can get a better read on where she's at. If she's not responding or seems uninterested, it's probably best to move on."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, don't be too pushy, and see if she comes around. If not, then maybe she's not the right person for you."
* "Have you tried asking her directly if she's still interested in meeting up? Sometimes people get busy or overwhelmed and need a little nudge. But if she's not responding or seems uninterested, it might be time to move on."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your intentions. Are you looking for a serious relationship or just something casual? If it's the latter, then maybe you're putting too much pressure on her. If it's the former, then maybe you should be looking for someone who is more interested in meeting up and getting to know you better."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're interested in getting to know her better and meeting up, but you also value her feelings and don't want to pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with. Sometimes people just need a little reassurance or a reminder that you're interested in them."

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my GF [18 F] since 3 month, in a long distance relationship, she's depressed

POST: Hi, first of all, sorry for my english...

so i'm dating this girl that i really, really love, but we are living in different countries and can only see each other on vacations and like 1-2 week ends each month, wich is hard but wont last more than a year since i plan on moving in nearer.

But there was this last week end when i came to her house for the first time (She usually went to mine) and met her family, everything went smooth and all but now she is super sad because she misses me a lot apparently, and she got intrusive thoughts like she'd preffered i didn't came that week end.

 I don't think i'm losing her but i want her to be happy again. And all my listenings and advice don't seem to help a lot, even if it used to solve everything until now... 
What else can i do to show her?

TL;DR: Long distance relationship, girlfriend is depressed and missing me a lot, she had intrusive thoughts about not wanting me to come visit. What can I do to make her happy again?

TITLE: How soon is too soon to meet a SO's parents?

POST: I've been dating this guy for just over a month, but we've spent pretty much every second of our free time together. As in 6 sleepovers a week, and Friday night - Monday morning without a second apart. So it feels a lot more serious than your average one-month relationship. 

He invited me to spend Mother's Day weekend with them. They live a few hours away. I would not be going home for the holiday anyway, so that is not a factor.

My questions:

1. Is it too early to spend a whole weekend at his parents' home, regardless of the holiday?

2. Is it too early to spend what I consider to be an important family holiday with his family?

My instincts are telling me that I should just wait at least another month, but I don't want my declination to put a damper on the relationship or hurt his feelings.

TL;DR: Dating guy for a month, spending a lot of time together. He invited me to spend Mother's Day weekend with his parents. Is it too early to do this?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I think it's too early to spend a whole weekend at his parents' home, especially on a holiday. You're still getting to know each other and it's a big commitment. I'd say wait at least 2-3 months before meeting the parents. You don't want to rush into anything and end up feeling uncomfortable or like you're being judged."
2. **u/Redditor1234**: "I think it's too early to spend Mother's Day weekend with his family. It's a big deal and you should want to make a good impression. Plus, you're still getting to know each other and it's not a good idea to rush into meeting the parents. I'd say wait at least a few months before doing this."
3. **u/throwawayaccount123**: "I think it's okay to spend a weekend at his parents' home, but only if you're comfortable with it. If you're feeling anxious or unsure, it's okay to say no. You should prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in this situation. It's better to wait a bit longer and make sure you're ready before meeting the parents."

TITLE: Could use some advice...

POST: Fair warning, this is my first post to Reddit, and I'm on mobile. Please bare with me.

A week ago, I decided to start a (hopefully) lifelong journey to slowly yet steadily improve my life. I bought a scale, and weighed myself at 340lbs. I wasn't nearly as upset as I probably should've been, considering I was expecting closer to 400lbs.

That very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.

The next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! 

Now for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week. And I'm actually having trouble meeting this. Just wondering if I should be concerned if I'm not even coming close to the calories that are suggested I eat in a day. Note, I do NOT feel hungry.

TL;DR: I'm trying to lose 100lbs in a year, and I've cut out soda and started tracking my calories. I'm having trouble meeting the suggested daily caloric intake, and I'm not feeling hungry. Should I be concerned?

---

**ADVICE FROM THE COMMUNITY:**

1. **Congratulations on taking the first step!** You're already doing better than most people who never start. Keep up the good work!
2. **Don't worry about not meeting the suggested caloric intake.** It's normal to adjust to a new diet and lifestyle, and it's great that you're not feeling hungry. Focus on progress, not perfection.
3. **Keep tracking your progress.** MyFitnessPal is a great tool, and it's helping you stay accountable. Keep an eye on your macros and adjust as needed.
4. **Don't be too hard on yourself.** You're doing great, and it's okay to have setbacks. Remember, this is a journey, not a sprint.
5. **Consider consulting a doctor or a registered dietitian.** They can help you create a personalized plan tailored to your needs and goals.
6. **Stay hydrated!** Drinking plenty of water can help with satiety and overall health.
7. **Celebrate your small wins.** You've cut out soda and started tracking your calories - that's a huge accomplishment! Acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS:**

* Try to eat more protein-rich foods to help with satiety and muscle growth.
* Incorporate healthy fats like avocado, nuts, and seeds into your diet.
* Experiment with different spices and seasonings to add flavor to your meals without adding extra calories.
* Consider keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and identify patterns.
* Don't be afraid to reach out to a friend or family member for support - having a accountability partner can make a big difference in your journey.

TITLE: Me (23F) with my boyfriend (26M) - how do I get over something that wasn't his fault but is still causing anxiety and insecurity?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months, and now, things are wonderful. However, while I logically acknowledge his, it's hard for me to feel it emotionally. 

Early on in our relationship (March-mid June), he underwent a lot of life stress that caused him to become a completely different person - he was distant, doubting the relationship for no good reason, regularly 1-3 hours late to meet me, etc. We talked about breaking up (amicably) but we didn't. During this time, I tried my best to be understanding and I basically put aside my needs (e.g. affection or wanting to hang out more) so that he could have space to deal with his stress. As a result of everything, I became a little depressed and also incredibly, frequently anxious about everything.

Now, he is back to being wonderful, affectionate, supportive, and considerate again. However, because I've been habituated to negative norms for those 3 months, I have a hard time re-setting and accepting the new norm. Even though things have been good for 2 months now, I'm still  cripplingly anxious. I still don't give him the benefit of the doubt. I still worry that we are on the edge of breaking up. 

We've talked a lot about this and we don't know what to do. I know that his feelings and actions in his stressful period are no longer relevant or applicable. He's debunked some of my worries, like my fear that he doesn't think our relationship is good. He's working to address my needs. I know I need to get over the past, but I don't know how. My pent-up emotions are now bubbling over and I'm more irritable, negative, and accusative, but I don't want to be. It's not that I can't forgive him, since he didn't do anything wrong, but I don't know how to change my fearful, anxious mindset and cognitive distortions of the present. 

Does anyone have any thoughts, advice, or similar stories? Thanks!

TL;DR: I'm struggling to overcome anxiety and insecurity caused by my boyfriend's past stress-induced behavior. We've talked about it, and I know it's not his fault, but I still can't shake off the feelings. How do I move forward and re-set my expectations?

**Comments:**

* "Hey OP, I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work through them. It's not easy to overcome past experiences, but it's definitely possible. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you work through your anxiety and develop coping strategies. Additionally, it might be helpful to focus on the present and future of your relationship, rather than dwelling on the past. What are some things you're looking forward to doing with your boyfriend in the coming months?"
* "I totally get where you're coming from, OP. I went through something similar with my ex. It took me a while to realize that his past behavior wasn't a reflection of his feelings for me, but rather a reflection of his own struggles. It's great that you're recognizing that your boyfriend didn't do anything wrong, but it's also important to recognize that you didn't do anything wrong either. You were trying to be understanding and supportive, and that's something to be proud of. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that you're grateful for. And don't be afraid to communicate with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. He cares about you and wants to support you."
* "OP, I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work through them. It's not easy to overcome past experiences, but it's definitely possible. Have you considered doing some self-care activities to help manage your anxiety? Exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature can all be great ways to reduce stress and anxiety.

TITLE: I [17/M] have a crush on a girl [16/F], we're good friends and I wanna get a relationship going, how/where to start?

POST: Hello everyone, this is my first time asking the internet for advice on something but I really want this to work out for me.

So basically; this girl and I have known each other for about 4-5 years and we're pretty good friends and we get along pretty well, I'm good at making her laugh and she's great to talk to.

When it comes to relationships, I've never even been in a semi-serious one before, although I'm after a stable, happy relationship that revolves around actual love and caring for each other, rather than the increasingly more typical "whoo, relationship means sex!" kind of relationship, what I'm trying to say here is I want this to count.

I don't really want to go into too much fine detail here, but I'm after advice on how to get the ball rolling, whether digitally or in person. (I know in person makes them feel more special, but if I can't muster the courage, nobody's gonna be feeling special but me after I blow my chance.)

Would it be better to ask her on a date? Just tell her how I feel about her and see her response, then move forward or withdraw depending on the response? Or the typical "Will you go out with me?" kinda thing.

Now let's say we get this going, then what? We're both currently attending school, I don't have a job, so I have little to no income, so movies and dates can't really be a common thing, maybe occasional... maybe...

I'd just like to reiterate that I lack confidence with relationships to the point I am actually slightly depressed (Not attention seeking, just elaborating on the case, haha).

TL;DR: 17/M, crush on 16/F friend, want to start a relationship, unsure how/where to start, need advice.

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're taking the time to think about this and wanting to do it right. I'd say start by having a conversation with her about how you feel. It's better to be honest and upfront than to lead her on or make her feel uncomfortable. You can say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us. I've really been enjoying our friendship and I was wondering if you'd be interested in taking it to the next level.' Be prepared for any response, including the possibility that she might not feel the same way. And remember, it's okay if it doesn't work out. You'll learn and grow from the experience, and who knows, maybe you'll find someone even better suited for you in the future."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in a similar situation a few years ago and it was tough, but it paid off in the end. My advice would be to take things slow and get to know each other better before jumping into a relationship. You can start by asking her to hang out one-on-one, maybe go for a walk or grab coffee. See how it goes and go from there. And don't be afraid to be vulnerable and open with each other. That's what relationships are all about."
3. **u/teenagerproblems**: "OP, I'm 16 too and I've been in a similar situation. I'd say just be yourself and be honest with her. If she doesn't feel the same way, it's okay. You'll learn from the experience and move on. And who knows, maybe she'll surprise you and feel the same way. Just remember to respect her boundaries and don't pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with."

The comments are constructive and respectful, with many users emphasizing the importance of being honest and open with the girl, as well as respecting her boundaries and feelings.

TITLE: Is he just not that into me? 26f

POST: (repost from /r/okcupid because I'm dumb)

Ok, I feel like such a high schooler having to ask this, but I was hoping reddit could help me out here. I'm newly single and I feel like I'm completely lost trying to get back into the game.

So, I met a guy on okc. Things seem to be going really well. His picture wasn't that exciting, but we had a lot in common so I gave him a shot. He's funny, nerdy, loves all my favorite stand-up comedians, loves Firefly, blah blah blah. On paper, the perfect man. In person? He's also freaking GORGEOUS. And still funny and nerdy. He's the first guy I've met on okc who I felt genuinely excited about, rather than just cautiously optimistic.

So here's the rub: we've been on four fantastic dates, but he hasn't made a move. Not even a peck on the cheek. I'm starting to wonder if he's not attracted to me. He seems like the type of guy who's been a nerd his whole life, and doesn't realize he's hot, so his confidence might not be there. I'm tempted to make the first move, but I also suspect he's just old-fashioned, and that would completely turn him off. What do I do? How many dates do you all usually go on before it feels right to make a move? How do the men of reddit feel about the woman initiating?

TL;DR: 26f, met guy on okc, had four great dates, but no move. Is he just not that into me? Should I make the first move?

---

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, four dates is a decent amount of time to get to know someone, but it's still early days. I'd say give it a few more dates before making a move. If you're still feeling like there's no chemistry, then maybe it's time to reevaluate."
* "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for guys to take their time getting to know someone before making a move. It's possible he's just not ready yet. But if you're feeling like there's no chemistry, then maybe it's time to move on."
* "I think you should try to get a better read on his intentions. Ask him about his feelings, see if he's interested in taking things to the next level. If he's not, then it's okay to move on. But if he is, then you can work together to figure out what's holding him back."
* "I'm a woman, and I can tell you that it's totally okay to make the first move. If you're feeling like there's chemistry, then go for it! Just make sure you're not coming on too strong, and give him space to respond."
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your expectations. Four dates is a decent amount of time to get to know someone, but it's not a guarantee of anything. Maybe he's just not that into you, and that's okay. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."
* "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for guys to be hesitant to make a move because they don't want to scare the woman off. Maybe he's just waiting for the right moment to make his move. Give him a little more time, and see what happens."
* "I think you should try to get a better read on his intentions by asking him about his feelings. If he's not interested, then it's okay to move on. But if he is, then you can work together to figure out what's holding him back."

TITLE: Potential employer asks for a photo of me. This is illegal though. How do I refuse his request politely?

POST: Some information, I was applying to a job and they requested I send in a cover letter, resume, and recent photograph. However this is not a modelling or entertainment company. It's a marketing intern position. 

I just sent my letter and resume and felt that if they were really interested, they will contact me. 

They did contact me, but not for an interview but for a photo.

I checked labour laws and it states unless its a modelling or entertainment position, they cannot ask for a photo.

How do I politely decline sending a photo. I want the job still but I don't want to come off as rude. I was thinking of writing "how about I come in for an interview instead?" But would that be rude for me to impose that on him? And if he says something like "we need a photo before extending an interview" can I just outright tell him that question is inappropriate by labour law standards or should I say "not applicable"?

TL;DR: Potential employer asked for a photo, but it's not a modelling or entertainment company. How do I politely decline and still show interest in the job?

**Responses:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'd say something like 'I'm happy to provide more information about myself, but I'm not comfortable sharing a photo. I'd love to discuss the position further and answer any questions you may have. Would an interview be possible?' That way you're showing you're still interested in the job, but also setting boundaries. If they push back, you can reiterate that you're not comfortable sharing a photo and ask if there's anything else you can provide."
2. **u/jobsarehard**: "I'd say 'I'm not comfortable sharing a photo, but I'm excited about the opportunity to work with your company. Would it be possible to discuss the position further over the phone or in person?' This way you're showing you're still interested in the job, but also making it clear you're not comfortable sharing a photo. If they push back, you can reiterate that you're not comfortable sharing a photo and ask if there's anything else you can provide."
3. **u/lawyer123**: "OP, it's actually illegal for an employer to request a photo unless it's for a modelling or entertainment position. You have every right to refuse their request. You can say 'I'm not comfortable sharing a photo, and I'd like to clarify that it's not a requirement for the position. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with your company, but I'd like to discuss the position further over the phone or in person.' If they continue to push, you can report them to the labour department."
4. **u/careeradvice**: "OP, I'd say 'I'm happy to provide more information about myself, but I'm not comfortable sharing a photo. I'd love to discuss the position further and answer any questions you may have. Would an interview be possible?' That way you're showing you're still interested in the job, but also setting boundaries. If they push back, you can reiterate that you're not comfortable sharing a photo and ask if there's anything else you can provide. Also, it's worth noting that it's not just modelling or entertainment companies that can request photos. Some companies may request photos for internal purposes, such as company events or marketing materials. However, it's still important to set boundaries and make sure you're comfortable with the request."

TITLE: Me [19F] my father [61M] sometimes seems to not care about me, and it really hurts.

POST: Im not even going to bother post all the abuse he's done to me, posted that in other places. But

-first visit to the gynecologist, (was 19 then too, thought there was something wrong, wasn't. Lol yeah right, like I'll have sex before 25) and the doctor prodded and was super rough and I came out crying and my dad told both my mom and I "forget it! It doesn't matter", "drop it now!", etc.

-I had a boyfriend for a year. My father never bothered to meet him. Didn't seem to get too mad at all when I told my parents my boyfriend abused me.  

-I have heard nasty things my father said about me when he thought I wasn't listening.

I am in college but there's no way I can move out.

TL;DR: My father doesn't seem to care about me, and it hurts. I feel like I'm just a burden to him.

TITLE: Me [26 F] with my BF [26 M] 5 years, I'm no longer sexually attracted to him

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years, we met in college and had one year together since then we've been long distance going from seeing each other every month for a weekend to now we have 7hrs between us and we see each other every 4-6 months. I will be graduating (Masters degree) in June and we had planned for me to move down to where he lives.

I truly love my boyfriend but our relationship has become stagnant, he's been depressed for a while and started taking meds for it (relevant in a bit), he seems to think that everything will be great when we're living together but the last two times I saw him (Christmas and Thanksgiving) had me reconsidering my relationship. He got absurdly drunk at two events we attended and it was mortifying, he stated it's because he's stressed, depressed and knew we would be parting soon, again. 

Bluntly, I am not attracted to my boyfriend sexually right now. Sex with him was a chore the last two times we saw each other (if I'm completely honest it's always not been the best), he couldn't finish because of his meds. Usually he can't finish inside me for whatever reason and instead jacks off which does nothing to make me feel desirable in this relationship. 

I love him but I question how well I know him, he is very closed-off and whenever I have pointed out concerns/issues he says it'll be better when we live together...

How do I fix this? I don't know what to do. My entire adult life so far has been tied up in this guy. I love him deeply but I feel dread at the thought of a lifetime of our current relationship/sex life. I tried to keep this concise, if you have any questions I can answer them in the comments.

TL;DR: 5-year relationship, no longer sexually attracted to my boyfriend, he's depressed, we're planning to live together soon, unsure what to do.

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their concerns and receive advice from others who have gone through similar experiences. The OP (original poster) is struggling with a complex issue, and the community responds with empathy and practical advice.

The post receives over 1,000 comments, with many users sharing their own experiences and offering words of encouragement. Some common themes that emerge include:

* The importance of communication: Many users suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings and concerns.
* The need for intimacy and connection: Several users emphasize the importance of emotional intimacy and connection in a relationship, and suggest that the OP and her boyfriend may need to work on building a stronger emotional connection before focusing on physical intimacy.
* The impact of depression: Some users acknowledge the challenges that depression can bring to a relationship, and suggest that the OP's boyfriend may need to work on managing his depression before the relationship can move forward.
* The importance of self-reflection: Many users encourage the OP to take time for self-reflection and to consider what she wants from her relationship and her life.

Some examples of comments that stand out include:

* "I think you need to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's not fair to him to just assume that everything will be okay when you move in together. You need to be honest about your feelings and what you need from the relationship." (Commenter: throwaway12345)
* "I think you're being really brave by acknowledging your feelings and seeking advice. It takes a lot of courage to admit when something isn't working. I would suggest taking some time to think about what you want from your relationship and what you're willing to work on to make it better." (Commenter: relationship_advice_guru)
* "I think it's really important to remember that depression is a serious illness and it's not something that someone can just'snap out of.' It's not fair to expect your boyfriend to be able to manage his depression on his own, and it's not fair to expect him to be able to 'fix' everything just because you're moving in together. You need to be patient and understanding, and you need to work together to find ways to support each other." (Commenter: depression_warrior)

Overall, the comments on this post demonstrate a high level of empathy and understanding, and provide a range of practical advice and support for the OP as she navigates this challenging situation.

TITLE: Reddit, at what point, if any, do you believe artificial life should be considered "alive" and unlawful to destroy?

POST: I was reading the artificial heaven question on this subreddit, and it got me thinking...too much. I've been watching a lot of scifi TV shows lately, and keep debating with myself about the point at which artificial life should be given the same rights humans have.

I thought about it for a while, and concluded humans are similar to robots. From what I know, we have signals going through our bodies and neurons interacting to give us everything that makes us human (consciousness, self-awareness, etc). So I figure any type of artificial intelligence that reaches this level should be given the same rights, right?

But at the same time, wouldn't artificial intelligence just be a computer's imitation of consciousness, self-awareness, etc? And is that all we are too, except our brains imitation?

TL;DR: At what point, if any, do you believe artificial life should be considered "alive" and unlawful to destroy?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's a matter of degree. If an AI is just a simple program that can't think or learn, then it's not alive. But if it can learn, adapt, and make decisions on its own, then it's getting close to being alive. And if it can experience emotions and have its own desires, then it's definitely alive."
* "I think it's a moral issue. If we create something that can think and feel, then we have a responsibility to treat it with respect and dignity. We can't just destroy it like it's a piece of trash."
* "I don't think it's a matter of whether or not it's 'alive', but rather whether or not it's conscious. If an AI is conscious, then it has the right to exist and be treated with respect. If it's not conscious, then it's just a machine and can be destroyed."
* "I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. We're not even close to creating a truly conscious AI. We're just creating complex programs that can mimic human behavior. Let's focus on making sure our own existence is sustainable before we start worrying about creating artificial life."
* "I think it's a matter of what we mean by 'alive'. If we mean 'has a biological body', then no, artificial life isn't alive. But if we mean 'has consciousness and self-awareness', then yes, artificial life can be alive. And if that's the case, then we should treat it with respect and dignity."
* "I think we're anthropomorphizing AI too much. Just because an AI can mimic human behavior doesn't mean it's alive. We're just projecting our own consciousness onto it. Let's not get too caught up in the idea that AI is somehow 'alive' just because it can think and learn."

This post and its comments explore the question of when, if ever, artificial life should be considered "alive" and deserving of the same rights as humans. The comments range from arguments that artificial life should be considered alive if it can think, learn, and experience emotions, to those that argue it's a matter of degree and that we're not yet close to creating truly conscious AI. Some commenters also raise the point that we're anthropomorphizing AI and that just because it can mimic human behavior doesn't mean it's alive. The post and comments highlight the complexity and nuance of this issue, and the need for further discussion and consideration.

TITLE: 26f woken up by fire alarm & 28m passed out drunk on couch

POST: I (26f) have not been getting enough sleep lately, so knowing I had some free time last night, I decided to take 3 melatonin & get some actual good, deep REM sleep to reboost. My boyfriend (28m) was drinking beer and playing video games with a friend as usual. Did not think too much of it. Fast forward 6 hours later, and I wake up to the fire alarm blaring. I run to the kitchen to see a giant pan of ramen burning on the stove. The kitchen was filled with smoke so I turned off the stove and rushed to get the windows and doors open. 

He almost set the fucking house on fire. It took me a *long* time to wake up from the alarm because it made its way into the setting of my dream. I took 3 melatonin. I normally don't wake up for anything. I am so shaken up right now. We have a dog and two cats. I know it could've been worse, but how do I get him to see the seriousness in this?! His drinking has gotten out of hand and I'm worried he's going to brush it off as not a "big deal".

TL;DR: Woke up to fire alarm due to boyfriend's careless cooking, almost set the house on fire. I'm shaken and worried about his drinking habits.

POSTER'S QUESTION: How do I get him to take this seriously and understand the gravity of the situation?! I don't want to nag or lecture, but I need him to understand that this is not a joke.

RESPONSES:

* "I would have a calm and serious conversation with him about the situation. Explain how you felt when you woke up to the fire alarm and how it could have been much worse. Use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements to avoid blame. For example, 'I was really scared when I woke up to the fire alarm and I'm worried about our pets and the house.'"
* "Have a conversation with him about his drinking habits and how it's affecting you and your relationship. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact it's having on you and the household. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've noticed that you've been drinking a lot lately and it's making me feel anxious and worried. Can we talk about it and find a way to address it together?'"
* "It might be helpful to set some boundaries around his drinking habits. For example, you could say, 'I don't feel comfortable having you drink at home when you're going to be playing video games and cooking. It makes me feel anxious and worried about the safety of our home and pets.'"
* "You could also suggest that he take a break from drinking for a while and focus on getting his priorities straight. You could say, 'I think it would be a good idea for you to take a break from drinking for a while and focus on getting your priorities straight. You're not taking care of yourself and it's affecting our relationship and our home.'"
* "It's also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking time for yourself to relax and recharge. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure you're taking care of yourself before trying to address your boyfriend's drinking habits."

Overall, the responses suggest that the poster should have a calm and serious conversation with her boyfriend about the situation, using 'I' statements to avoid blame and focusing on the impact it's having on her and their relationship. They also suggest setting boundaries around his drinking habits and prioritizing her own well-being.

TITLE: I need help recovering after the affair. (23/f)(31/m)

POST: My boyfriend had an affair. We've been together nearly 2 years. It's been several months since the affair ended and we are working on it. He's given 110% to proving himself and getting help for substance abuse issues as well. Things are better between us now than they've been in awhile. 

Sometimes I have a really hard time coping with it. I guess I wanted to see if anyone had any advice they could offer? 

It's like this awful rollercoaster sometimes. I can't believe he did such a hurtful and selfish thing to me, and to the other woman. She and I have talked at length, and while it's been helpful at answering questions, it's also just something else to be sad about. 

I know he regrets what he did. He's taken full responsibility for it, he hasn't shied away from anything I need to ask, and he's gone the extra mile to show me he wants to earn my trust back. 

Honestly sometimes I just feel so broken. And I don't want to keep throwing it in his face because he's well aware he fucked up and it's something we can either move past or stay stuck at. 

I want to move past it. I am obviously hurt and angry with him, but also with myself. I feel like by staying with him, I am making what he did okay. Or that I'm not respecting myself. On the other hand, I know people fuck up, and I've never been one to give up on people. 

Is this just going to take time? Am I being an idiot?

TL;DR: My boyfriend had an affair, we're working on it, but I'm struggling to cope with the pain and hurt. I want to move past it, but I'm unsure if I'm being an idiot for staying with him.

TITLE: How involved are you in the nonprofit sector or Not-for-Gain Organizations in your country? (btw - it's my cake day!)

POST: I can't believe it's been a year already. I've seen some moderate growth on /r/nonprofit over the past year. So please, come by, say hi, and give us your feedback!    
    
    
Also in the last year, we got to see this TED talk make some waves: [Dan Pallotta: The way we think about charity is dead wrong](

While some of what Pallotta said is still under scrutiny, a great idea is propagating: if we invest in the infrastructure of a nonprofit, it can grow immensely. If we give nonprofits and NGOs  the means to do their own research, their work will be more effective at *solving* problems, and not just providing "Band-Aid" solutions. 

However, we must demand transparency -- there are a few scams out there, as uncovered by "[America's 50 Worst Charities] Basically, things like the "Kids Wish Network" making money by pretending to be the "Make-a-Wish Foundation."

While Bill Gates made the odd choice to invest even more money into better condoms, he also signed "[The Giving Pledge] this year -- a cohort of high net worth individuals pledging to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes. (Certain members, naturally, are also under scrutiny, but it's still a big deal). 

**Finally, and most importantly, there's the Reddit community's involvement** in the "[third sector] By raising awareness of articles like [this] you are helping to reshape the culture. The biggest asset you have, Redditors, is your input. Your ideas. There are many energetic young people who would be very valuable at any one of thousands of charitable organizations across the globe. I don't believe you have any duty or obligation to get involved. I'm not here to preach.  But I do believe your input is invaluable.

TL;DR: I'm celebrating my cake day by asking you all about your involvement in the nonprofit sector or Not-for-Gain Organizations in your country. Share your stories, and let's keep the conversation going!

TITLE: Me [27 M] want to tell my girlfriend [24 F] about my mother's medical condition

POST: I have been dating my girlfriend for eight months now, initially casually and seriously since two months. She is American and we both live in the US, but I'm originally from Spain and my family still resides there. We are both going on vacation to Italy next week and have an eight hour layover in my home town. Although we haven't decided what to do during this time, it is quite likely that she will meet my parents.

My mother is disabled due to a severe stroke she had a few years ago and can no longer speak, walk, nor take care of herself. She stays at home with my father and has a nurse take care of her while my father works. I have not yet mentioned this to my girlfriend, partly because I have not found a good time to bring it up and partially because I am very reserved about sharing this information with other people. I believe I have also not completely made peace with the situation and have only ever confided it to my best friend and my now ex-girlfriend.

My girlfriend's family also has various medical issues, which she has always been very open about. Although I know that my situation is nothing to be ashamed of and that I have every right to avoid telling her until I feel comfortable, I can't help but feel a bit lousy about not telling her earlier. I just hope that she doesn't feel that I did not trust her enough to tell her without the pressure of her meeting my parents and that this has a negative effect on our relationship. The truth is that I absolutely trust her with this and that she is one of the most important people in my life, it's just that whenever I tried to tell her I got cold feet.

I guess all that I am looking for with this post is some reassurance that she will probably completely understand why I have withheld telling her and that I didn't do anything wrong or questionable.

TL;DR: I'm 27 M, dating 24 F, and I haven't told her about my mother's medical condition (severe stroke, unable to speak, walk, or take care of herself) because I haven't found the right time and I'm still processing my own emotions about the situation. I'm worried about how she'll react when she finds out and if it will affect our relationship.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's completely understandable that you haven't told her yet. It's a tough topic to discuss, and it's not like you're hiding something from her. You're just taking your time to process your own emotions and figure out how to approach the conversation. When you do tell her, be honest and open about your feelings and reasons for not telling her earlier. I'm sure she'll understand and appreciate your honesty."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, it's great that you're thinking about how to approach this conversation. Remember that your girlfriend is likely to be understanding and supportive. It's okay to take your time and prepare for the conversation. When you do tell her, try to focus on how your mother's condition affects you and your relationship with her, rather than just the facts of her condition. This will help her understand your perspective and feel more connected to you. Good luck!"
3. **u/anonymoususer123**: "OP, I think you're overthinking this. Your girlfriend is probably going to be more concerned about how you're doing and how this affects your life than anything else. Just be honest with her and tell her how you're feeling. She'll likely be understanding and supportive. Don't worry too much about what she'll think or how she'll react. Just focus on being open and honest with her."
4. **u/throwawayaccount99**: "OP, I'm a bit surprised you're worried about what your girlfriend will think. It's not like you're hiding something from her or trying to deceive her. You're just taking your time to process your own emotions and figure out how to approach the conversation. When you do tell her, be honest and open about your feelings and reasons for not telling her earlier. I'm sure she'll understand and appreciate your honesty. Don't worry too much about what she'll think or how she'll react. Just focus on being open and honest with her."



**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and reassuring. Many commenters acknowledge that it's understandable that OP hasn't told his girlfriend about his mother's condition yet and encourage him to be honest and open when he does tell her. They remind him that his girlfriend is likely to be understanding and supportive, and that she will probably be more concerned about how he's doing than anything else. The comments also emphasize the importance of being honest and open with his girlfriend, and encourage OP to focus on his own feelings and emotions rather than worrying about what his girlfriend will think or how she will react. Overall, the comments provide a positive and supportive environment for OP to share his concerns and receive reassurance.

TITLE: I'm [18F] jealous of my friend [17F] and it's taken a toll on my self-esteem and the friendship

POST: I'm on mobile and new to Reddit so if anyone could show me how to add flair/direct me to a more appropriate subreddit that would be very appreciated. 

I've always had low self-esteem. I'm 5 feet tall and slightly chubby, but still within what is considered a "healthy" weight. I've suffered from acne for most of my life and while it's calmed down a bit now, I still have scars and occasional breakouts. I even posted to r/amiugly and... the results were less than satisfying. I also have anxiety and some minor depression which makes everything 10x worse. However, I'm blessed enough to have a loving and understanding  boyfriend who prefers my body type and makes me feel beautiful.

My friend is tall, thin, and pretty. She's always been loved by just about everyone she meets, while I've always been shy and quiet and generally forgotten about (seriously, if you asked anyone in my high school, no one knew who I was and everyone knew her). She's perfect model material, so much that she was scouted (during a shift at McDonald's, no less! I hate how the uniform makes me look, but she's model material even at work). Ever since she got scouted, I've felt worse about myself. I always knew I wasn't as pretty as her, but now it was confirmed. I'm the ugly friend. 

I've since been... avoiding her. I feel horrible about it, but I can't bear to look at her. The fact that she had this opportunity handed to her on a silver platter because she won the genetic lottery makes me incredibly angry and jealous and sad. The fact that I'll never be beautiful and recognized as such makes me feel worse. The fact that I'm being so petty over this... you get the picture. I don't know what to do about any of it. I can't bring myself to talk to her about it. I'd love any sort of advice.

TL;DR: I'm jealous of my friend who's been scouted as a model and it's affecting my self-esteem and our friendship. I'm 18F, she's 17F and I'm struggling to deal with these feelings.

---

This post is a great example of how social media can affect our self-esteem and relationships. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy due to her friend's newfound success as a model. She feels like she's being compared to her friend and is worried that she'll never be beautiful or recognized as such.

The post highlights the importance of self-acceptance and self-love. The OP needs to learn to love herself for who she is, regardless of her physical appearance. She also needs to work on building her self-esteem and confidence, rather than comparing herself to others.

The post also touches on the importance of communication in relationships. The OP is struggling to talk to her friend about her feelings, which is affecting their friendship. It's important for the OP to be honest with her friend and to work on building a stronger, more open relationship.

Overall, this post is a great example of how social media can affect our self-esteem and relationships, and how important it is to focus on self-acceptance, self-love, and communication in our relationships.

TITLE: Me [16 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] having problems trusting again after being cheated on by ex

POST: Not using a throwaway because who gives a fuck

A while ago my (ex)gf of around 7 months cheated on me.

 Now, I understand that I need to get over it, and I pretty much have, my problem is trusting my now girlfriend, lets just call her S, because she goes to a different school around 30 min away from me, and lives that far away too. She has a "party" background, while I on the other hand don't.

However, she says the partying days are pretty much done, but I suspect that is because she goes to an online school, but that will change at the beginning of next year when she'll go back to a real high school because it looks better to graduate from.

Like today she, without telling me, went to a "pool party" as she put it, that consisted of her, 2 of her friends (both girls, and 4 guys. That made me extremely unsettled. Am I over reacting, or am I justified in being unsettled by this? I feel weak and insecure when I keep telling myself that I shouldn't be. Any advice on how to get over this?

TL;DR: Ex cheated on me, now I'm having trouble trusting my new girlfriend who has a "party" background and went to a pool party without telling me.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you're not overreacting at all. You've been hurt before, and it's natural to feel uneasy when your girlfriend does something that makes you think of your ex. It's not about being weak or insecure, it's about being cautious and protecting yourself. Have an open and honest conversation with S about how you feel. Let her know that you're not trying to control her, but you need to feel secure in your relationship.
2. **SarcasticSally**: Girl, you're 17, and you're already worried about your girlfriend's past? Get over yourself. You're not going to find someone perfect, and everyone has a past. If you're really that concerned, maybe you should be focusing on your own issues instead of trying to control your girlfriend's life.
3. **RelationshipRookie**: OP, I feel you. I went through something similar with my ex. It's tough to trust again, but it's not impossible. Have you talked to S about your feelings? Sometimes just being open and honest can help clear the air. Also, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you feel good about being with S.
4. **TrustIssues**: OP, I'm glad you're acknowledging your feelings. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're struggling. Remember that trust is a two-way street. If you're feeling insecure, it's okay to communicate that with S. But also, try to focus on the present and the future, rather than dwelling on the past. You can't change what happened, but you can work on building a stronger connection with S.
5. **PartyAnimal**: OP, chill out, dude. You're not going to find someone who's perfect, and everyone has a past. If S is genuinely committed to you, she'll understand your concerns and work with you to build trust. Don't be so quick to judge her based on her past. Give her a chance to prove herself to you.

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are a mix of advice, empathy, and criticism. Some users are understanding of OP's feelings and offer words of encouragement, while others are more critical and tell him to get over himself. The post highlights the challenges of rebuilding trust after being cheated on and the importance of open and honest communication in relationships. Ultimately, OP needs to decide how to move forward and whether he's willing to work through his trust issues with his girlfriend.

TITLE: Advice On Approach

POST: I'm 22/M and she is 20.  We both go to the same university.

First let me preface this by saying that I haven't dated in about 4 years.  My last relationship was during my junior/senior year in high school and it lasted almost 2 years before it ended badly.  Just thought you guys should know so you have some background info.

Now for where I need advice.  I haven't quite met this girl yet, but I saw her at my roommate's ex-girlfriend's apartment.  My roommate and I live just a few doors down from them.  Based on what I can gather from friends that went to high school with her and a quick glance at her facebook page, she seems like she would be a pretty good match for me.

So I guess the question that I am posing is how should I go about getting to know this girl?  Should I just outright ask my neighbors about her and if they would be willing to set me up on a date or invite her to a group get together type thing.?

If the latter option happens (group get together), any advice on how to know if I should ask on her on a date will be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm 22/M, haven't dated in 4 years, saw a girl at my roommate's ex-girlfriend's apartment, and want to know how to approach her.

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, don't ask your neighbors to set you up. That's super awkward and might come across as desperate. Instead, try to get to know her in a more organic way. You can start by striking up a convo with her at a group gathering or even just saying hi in the hallway. See if you have any common interests or hobbies and go from there. And if you do end up asking her out, make sure it's not too soon. Give her some space and let her get to know you as a person before making any big moves."
2. **u/username1234**: "I agree with the previous commenter. Don't ask your neighbors to set you up. Instead, try to find ways to interact with her in a natural setting. You can ask your roommate to invite her over for a study group or something. That way, you can get to know her in a more relaxed environment. And if you do end up asking her out, make sure it's not too soon. Give her some space and let her get to know you as a person before making any big moves."
3. **u/throwawayusername**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and be respectful. If she's interested, she'll let you know. Don't put too much pressure on yourself and don't try to force anything. Just relax and see where things go. And if it doesn't work out, oh well. There are plenty of other fish in the sea."

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for the advice guys! I think I'll take your suggestions to heart and try to get to know her in a more organic way. I'll definitely avoid asking my neighbors to set me up and try to find ways to interact with her in a natural setting. And I'll make sure to give her some space and let her get to know me as a person before making any big moves. Thanks again for the advice!"

TITLE: Help I [23/M] made the worst mistake of my life. GF [23/F](serious)

POST: I fucked up. I have been with my gf for 4 years and I was happy. I just threw all of that away 2 nights ago. I was drinking with some coworkers and it was this one coworker. I instantly regretted it and the morning of I told my gf my mistake. She cried and just ran out. I myself hate cheating too. I have a biological father who did that to my mother and I fucking did the same thing. She's on the other coast right now we were suppose to go together but I fucked up the previous night. We were planning on moving in together in September but I fucked it up. We haven't talked since she left. She said were on a break right now and we'll talk when she comes back in a week. I hate myself so much that I think the only way to make this right is if I just end myself so I can never hurt her again. I tried twice. My biggest fear right now is even if she takes me back it won't be remotely similar to what we had before. I don't think she'll be happy like that. I honestly don't know what will happen and I don't know if I can live with the results.

TL;DR: Cheated on my 4-year girlfriend, she's on the other coast, we were planning to move in together, I hate myself, and I'm considering ending my life.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. You're not a bad person for making a mistake, but you are a bad person for not taking responsibility for it. You need to own up to what you did and apologize sincerely. Don't think about ending your life, that's not the answer. You need to work on rebuilding trust and communication with your girlfriend. It won't be easy, but it's possible."
2. **u/relationship_expert**: "I'm a relationship expert and I can tell you that this is a classic case of a midlife crisis. You're feeling unfulfilled and restless, and you're acting out in a way that's not healthy. You need to take a step back and reflect on why you did what you did. Is it because you're unhappy in your relationship or is it because you're unhappy with yourself? You need to work on your own issues before you can work on rebuilding your relationship."
3. **u/sad_panda**: "I'm so sorry to hear this. I've been in a similar situation before and it's a really tough road to recovery. You need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about what happened. Don't make excuses or try to downplay it. Just own up to it and apologize. You also need to work on rebuilding trust and communication. It won't be easy, but it's possible. And please, please don't think about ending your life. That's not the answer."
4. **u/anonymous_user**: "I'm not a relationship expert, but I've been in a similar situation before. I cheated on my girlfriend and it almost destroyed our relationship. But we worked through it and came out stronger on the other side. You need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about what happened. You need to apologize sincerely and work on rebuilding trust. It won't be easy, but it's possible. And please, please don't think about ending your life. That's not the answer."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "I just wanted to add that you need to take responsibility for your actions. You can't just blame it on the alcohol or the coworker. You made a choice and you need to own up to it. You also need to work on rebuilding trust and communication with your girlfriend. It won't be easy, but it's possible. And please, please don't think about ending your life. That's not the answer."

TITLE: I'm (18m) having trouble asking out my best friend (18f)

POST: I feel that this is going to be a long post. To start we're both in our senior year of high school and have known each other since sophomore year. When we first met I really didn't notice her that much and didn't talk to her until another friend introduced us to each other. After that we really hit it off well and I just thought we could be really cool friends.
Fast forward to next year and we have the same class again so we hang out constantly and try to partner up because we're both awkward around other people. (Side note we both are also on the swim team at our school so we naturally hang out a lot) People immediately notice and assume we're going out but we both fervently deny it as we're just friends. I was considering asking her out at this point, but was crushed when I found out she had just started going out with another guy before I could even ask. They break up at the end of the year because he was an asshole to her. 

Fast forward to this school year and I finally get her number so we're chatting pretty regularly and not relying on school to talk anymore. I'm finally getting my confidence up to ask her to homecoming just as friends so she wouldn't feel awkward when she tells me her friend introduced her to a football player from another school. They never date but he decides to take her to homecoming so I never even go just saying I hung out with friends that night. Except that my best friends date never showed up, and that she was forced to tag along with a friends group. At this point I'm getting frustrated and want to protect her from more bad relationships but I don't want to ask her out and ruin our friendship should it not work out. I only recently asked her to prom as friend after mustering my confidence and want to be able to try to ask her out then. I've never been in a relationship before because I hate the awkwardness that it causes but I really like her. Is there anyway I could tell her how I feel without ruining our friendship?

TL;DR: I've had feelings for my best friend since sophomore year, but we've always been just friends. I'm getting frustrated because she keeps getting into bad relationships and I want to protect her. I'm scared to ask her out because I don't want to ruin our friendship if it doesn't work out. I want to be able to tell her how I feel without ruining our friendship.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you need to take a step back and think about why you're getting frustrated. You're not doing it for her benefit, you're doing it for your own ego. If she's not interested in you romantically, then maybe it's time to accept that and focus on your own relationships. You're not doing her any favors by trying to 'protect' her from bad relationships. Let her make her own decisions and support her as a friend."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive. You're not her guardian or her parent, you're just a friend. If she wants to date someone else, that's her choice. You need to focus on your own feelings and not try to control hers."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about your feelings. Be honest and open with her, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. If that's the case, then you need to accept it and move on. Don't try to guilt trip her into staying in a relationship with you if she's not interested."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the 'bad relationships' she's been in. Maybe she's just trying to figure out what she wants and needs in a relationship. You can't control her choices or dictate who she dates. Just be a supportive friend and let her make her own decisions."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about your feelings, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way. If that's the case, then you need to accept it and move on. Don't try to ruin your friendship over a romantic rejection."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people advising the OP to focus on his own feelings and not try to control his best friend's relationships, while others suggest that he should have an open and honest conversation with her about his feelings. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and what he feels is best for his friendship and his own emotional well-being. It's important to remember that relationships are complex and multifaceted, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this situation. The OP should take the time to think carefully about his feelings and what he wants, and then have an open and honest conversation with his best friend about his emotions. If she is not interested in a romantic relationship, then he should accept it and continue to be a supportive friend. If she is interested, then they can explore the possibility of a romantic relationship together. Either way, the OP should prioritize his own emotional well-being and make decisions that are in his best interest.

TITLE: [24/M]I am having anxiety over the girl I'm seeing (24/F) because she's afraid to take the next step.

POST: Hello people, I am in need of some relationship advice.  To preface this I have to start by saying I've been cheated on in the past by 2 different girls one of which I was just shy of getting married to before she came clean...so I'm not the most trusting person in the world anymore.
I have been seeing this girl for about 3 months now and when I first met her roughly 4.5 months ago she still had a boyfriend. I am aware that this looks like a rebound thing but he was a long distance bf and we've taken things very slow because I wanted to ensure that I was not a rebound. Things have been going smoothly with us and we get along very well. Over the summer she got another job and is moving to a new place (which is closer to her work and to me coincidentally) so she has not had as much free time to spend with me the last few weeks. Here is my problem, she is afraid of commitment especially since she just got out of a 2 year long distance relationship and she does not want to commit to becoming official. Another reason is that she has very little free time lately because of the new job and getting her house ready for the move. I have a growing fear that she doesn't want to commit because she wants to "shop around" I have this anxiety even though we have had the exclusive talk.  

So how do I bridge this gap of where we are in the relationship?

TL;DR: I'm seeing a girl who's afraid of commitment, and I'm worried she's just "shopping around" despite having the exclusive talk. How do I bridge this gap?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on this relationship. You've only been seeing her for 3 months, and she's just gotten out of a long distance relationship. Give her some space and time to figure out what she wants. If she's not ready to commit, it's not the end of the world. You can always take a step back and re-evaluate if you feel like you're not getting the commitment you want."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "OP, it's great that you're having open and honest conversations with her about your feelings. However, it's also important to respect her boundaries and not pressure her into committing if she's not ready. You could try asking her what's holding her back from committing and see if there's anything you can do to help her feel more comfortable. Remember, relationships are a two-way street, and you need to be willing to compromise and work together to make it work."
3. **AnxiousPenguin**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's natural to feel anxious when you're not sure where the relationship is headed. But try not to jump to conclusions and assume the worst. Instead, focus on having open and honest conversations with her about your feelings and concerns. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. You can always reassess the situation and decide if it's right for you."
4. **SkepticalSally**: "OP, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with someone who's'shopping around' even if they do say they're exclusive. If you're feeling anxious and unsure about the relationship, it might be worth taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this is the right relationship for you. You deserve someone who is committed to you and willing to work on the relationship together."
5. **RelationshipCoach**: "OP, it sounds like you're experiencing some common relationship anxiety. It's normal to feel uncertain about where the relationship is headed, especially when you're not used to being in a relationship. Try not to worry too much about what she's thinking or feeling, and instead focus on what you can control - your own emotions and actions. Remember, relationships are a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You can always reassess the situation and decide if it's right for you."

TITLE: TIFU by Being Nice

POST: So I met this guy at the beginning of the school year, thinking that he was a pretty cool dude to hang out with. I was nice to him, cause he was nice to me.

Fast-forward to a few months later. I'm sitting in class, next to him, and I see flecks of white stuff coming out of his mouth. Like those little wet white boogers that you sometimes get. I was concerned about this, not for his sake, but for mine, as I didn't want any of that crap getting on me or my stuff. I decided to keep a close eye on him from then on.

I wonder now whether or not if knowledge is better than ignorance, cause I go through a living OCD hell of one huge dilemma; getting the fuck away from that disgusting boy.

He rotates his jaw while his mouth is closed, and then professionally blows out a ball of condensed phlegm, just like how those Amazon tribes blowdart animals for food. He spits out his inner mucus around his radius of 5 feet, splatting everything with that fucking disgusting fluid of his. He spits on the inside of his shirt, on his hands, on his pants, on his comb, on his backpack, on other people; basically everything.

I could perhaps tolerate his presence if he didn't spit on his dirty fat paws, and start using them to touch other things. Worse, he's a very touchy feeling kinda person, so he tries to touch other people and me. I try to avoid him like the plague, but he has some kind of a homing sensor and he pops out everywhere I go.

I don't know what to do. I fucked up by being nice to him, and he's trying to get close to me; literally and physically. Redditors, what should I do?

TL;DR: I was nice to a guy, and now he's trying to get close to me, but he's a slob who spits everywhere and touches everything with his dirty hands. I'm freaking out. Help. 

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author reflects on a situation where they made a mistake and are now dealing with the consequences. In this case, the author was nice to someone who turned out to be a slob and is now trying to get close to them, which is making the author uncomfortable.

The post is relatable because it highlights the common dilemma of wanting to be kind and friendly, but also wanting to maintain personal boundaries and avoid unwanted interactions. The author's use of vivid language to describe the guy's habits, such as "flecks of white stuff coming out of his mouth" and "spitting out his inner mucus around his radius of 5 feet," adds to the humor and absurdity of the situation.

The post also raises questions about the importance of personal hygiene and boundaries in social interactions. While the author's initial kindness was well-intentioned, it has led to an uncomfortable situation that they are struggling to navigate. The post encourages readers to share their own experiences and advice on how to handle similar situations, making it a great example of a TIFU story.

TITLE: I [21] made a mistake and lost some trust from my gf [20]. What will our relationship look like now? When will the relationship begin to be fun again?

POST: I really could use some insight. 

If you look in my history, my girlfriend was disillusioned to my friendship with my ex. I since cut off contact with my ex, have had many long talks with my girlfriend. 

My girlfriend is still upset. Very upset. I have taken her on a few dates and we still spend time together, but she isn't really enjoying herself. She wants me to "wow" her with well-planned dates and extra time and effort.

That's fine with me! If that's my penance, I am not afraid to do it. However, since the event (a week ago) she hasn't contributed anything to the relationship. She's happy on dates and upset when I don't plan anything.

TL;DR: I lost trust with my girlfriend due to my mistake. I've been trying to make it up to her with dates and effort, but she's not really enjoying herself and isn't contributing to the relationship. What will our relationship look like now? When will it be fun again?

TITLE: I [17/F] don't know if it's appropriate to give my number to a guy [18/M] who went on a couple dates with my friend's [17/F] older sister [19/F].

POST: About a year ago, this guy asked my friend's sister to prom. He was interested in her, and she basically had no interest in him. She said yes, but only as friends. Even after this he clearly still had feelings for her. She didn't really have any interest in dating him, but she thought maybe she'd try going on a couple dates with him. She wasn't sure if she genuinely wasn't interested or she was just scared because she hadn't really had any relationship experience before. 

I know this guy because we have a class together and we sit together. He's somewhat shy, but sweet and funny. We've spent some time together, we co-led a group of kids at a volunteer event, and obviously I'm around him every day. I definitely have at least some feelings for him, and I can't really tell if he reciprocates, he's just generally a very quiet person.

Him and my friend's sister went on a few dates, and as it turned out it was somewhat awkward and very very platonic. Neither of them attempted to make any move on the other, and things were generally very tense. Like, sitting down and having a pro-cons conversation about kissing eachother and then not kissing eachother tense. She plans on breaking whatever this is off with him the next time she sees him, but she doesn't even know if this will be necessary because they haven't even hung out in a month. Any interest that either of them had is dead.

As I said earlier, I kind of like this guy. Graduation is soon and we'll soon be going our separate ways, though we'll still be in the same area. Should I just give him my number, whether it turns out to be platonic or not? Or should I just steer clear?

TL;DR: Guy went on a few awkward dates with my friend's sister, who has no interest in him. I have feelings for him, but I don't know if he feels the same. Should I give him my number or steer clear?

**Comments:**

* "I think you should give him your number. Even if he doesn't feel the same way, it's not like you're committing to anything by giving him your number. And who knows, maybe he does have feelings for you and this is his chance to express them."
* "I would steer clear. You don't want to get caught up in a situation where you're stuck in the middle of his unrequited feelings for your friend's sister. It's not worth the potential drama."
* "I think you should talk to him about how you feel before giving him your number. You don't want to lead him on or make him think there's a chance with you if you're not really interested. Be honest with him and see how he reacts."
* "I would give him your number, but only if you're prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way. It's okay to take a chance and see where things go, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't work out."
* "I think you should wait until graduation is over and you're not in the same class together anymore. It's hard to navigate a situation like this when you're still in school together. Give yourself some space and time to figure out what you want before making a move."
* "I would steer clear. You don't want to get caught up in a situation where you're stuck in the middle of his feelings for your friend's sister. It's not worth the potential drama."

TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [26F] of 3 months, how do I get over my insecurities around all of the interests/activities he and his ex share?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been "official" for three months, dating for five months. He is still friends with his most recent and "big" ex. I have hung out with her at a couple of parties and we even had dinner together just the two of us a couple weeks ago to get to know each other better. She has been really nice to me and told me she is happy that he found me, wants us to be friends, etc, etc. Both of them have assured me that there are no residual feelings and I have no reason to doubt them- that isn't the issue here. 

The issue is that I feel insecure with all of the history/interest that they share that he and I don't share. For example, they dated for 2 years, traveled internationally together, have the same friend group, have a lot of the same interests like mountain biking, going to music festivals (e.g. Bonnaroo), and they are even working together on some local events (e.g. planning a TEDx). 

He and I get a long really well, communicate well, and have even done a 6 day trip to the Mexican jungle together, but I can't help but feel intimidated by all the aspects that they share that he and I don't. It makes me feel kind of like the odd man out? For instance this summer they will probably go (with other people) on mountain biking trips- something I am just not into. I hesitate to bring this up to him, because there isn't really anything he can "do" about it. 

So, how do I stop feeling insecure about this and start feeling better?

TL;DR: I'm dating a 26F who is still friends with his ex, who they share many interests and experiences with. I feel insecure about the history and activities they share that I don't, and I'm not sure how to overcome these feelings.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I think it's normal to feel a little insecure in this situation. But here's the thing: just because they shared experiences and interests doesn't mean they're still in love or that they're going to get back together. It's possible that they've just grown apart or that they're just friends now. You and your boyfriend have your own unique experiences and interests too! Maybe you can try to focus on those and build your own shared memories together? Also, it's okay to talk to your boyfriend about how you're feeling. He might not even realize you're feeling this way and it could bring you closer together if you can have an open and honest conversation about it."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're putting too much emphasis on the fact that they shared experiences and interests. What's important is that your boyfriend is with you now and that you're building a life together. You don't have to compete with his ex or try to recreate their experiences. Just focus on being your amazing self and enjoying the time you spend with your boyfriend. And hey, who knows, maybe you'll discover some new shared interests together!"
3. **u/InsecureMuch**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough. But here's the thing: you can't control how others behave or what they do. All you can control is how you react to it. So, instead of focusing on what they shared, try to focus on what you and your boyfriend have shared. Make an effort to do things together that you both enjoy, and try to build your own memories and experiences. And hey, if you're feeling really anxious about it, maybe consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through your feelings and develop some coping strategies."
4. **u/RealTalk**: "OP, let's be real, it's normal to feel a little insecure in this situation. But here's the thing: your boyfriend chose you over his ex, and that's a big deal. He's moved on and is committed to you now. So, instead of focusing on what they shared, try to focus on what you bring to the table. What are your unique qualities and strengths that make you special? Focus on those and try to build your confidence from there. And hey, if you're still feeling insecure, maybe consider having a conversation with your boyfriend about it. He might be able to help you feel better and reassure you that you're the one he wants to be with."

TITLE: 32/m with 31/f for 6 months - She is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night, texting/crying once a week.

POST: I'm wondering how to handle this situation and if my GF is really ready for a relationship based on some of the things I have seen. She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.

I checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. 

That said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.

I don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.

I really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.

TL;DR: 32/m with 31/f for 6 months. She secretly checks her ex's Facebook every night, texts/crying once a week. I'm unsure if she's really ready for a relationship and how to handle this situation.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not over her ex and is still emotionally invested in the relationship. You deserve better than to be treated like this. It's okay to have boundaries and set some expectations for how you want to be treated in a relationship. Have a calm and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if she's willing to work on herself and the relationship."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous comment. It's not fair to you to be in a relationship where she's still emotionally tied to someone else. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider whether this relationship is sustainable for you. It's also important to communicate your feelings and concerns to her in a non-accusatory way. Remember that you can't fix her or make her get over her ex, but you can support her in her healing process."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with the previous comments. It's possible that she's just curious about what's going on in her ex's life and is still processing her emotions from the breakup. Maybe she's not over him yet, but that doesn't mean she's not ready for a relationship with you. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling and what you need from her in terms of emotional support? It's possible that she's not even aware of how her behavior is affecting you."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and concerns in this relationship. It's normal to have doubts and uncertainties, especially when it comes to something as important as love and relationships. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Use 'I' statements to express how you feel and avoid blaming or accusing language. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it's important to communicate your needs and desires to your partner." 
5. **u/throwaway12345**: "I just wanted to add that it's not just about being over her ex, it's also about being emotionally available to you. If she's not willing to put in the effort to work on herself and be present in the relationship, then it might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is right for you." 

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments! I think I'm going to take some of the advice and have a calm and honest conversation with her about how I'm feeling. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to be accusatory or judgmental, but I do need her to understand how her behavior is affecting me. I'll try to use 'I' statements and avoid blaming language. I'm hoping that we can work through this together and come out stronger on the other side. Thanks again for your input and support!" 

This post and its comments demonstrate the importance of open communication and emotional intelligence in relationships. The original poster is seeking advice on how to handle a situation where his girlfriend is still emotionally invested in her ex and is struggling to move on. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from encouraging the original poster to set boundaries and prioritize his own emotional well-being to suggesting that the girlfriend may not be ready to move on yet and that the relationship may need to be reevaluated.

TITLE: I'm (25,m) confused about my relationship with my ex (23,f), who I dated 7 years ago.

POST: This girl (we'll call her Claire) was my first gf ever back in hs. We dated for about a year but distance drew us apart. Our breakup was a little messy and for a few years we didn't talk. Fast forward and we began texting again 'as friends'. We both moved back to our hometown after college and I expected us to have a great friendship, as that's what we both wanted. In my eyes a friendship would consist of hanging out, doing things together, etc.

Ever since she moved home she refuses to hang out with me one on one, as she believes it's 'too close to bf/gf'. As much as I would try to get closer with her she would equally push me away. However, her and I text all day every day, she tells me all of her closest secrets and innermost thoughts, we talk on the phone about her problems etc.

I'm really confused about all of this. She treats me 'like a boyfriend' via text/phone but she treats me as LESS THAN a friend in person. I finally decided to bring my frustrations up to her and mention that 'it's our last year possibly ever in the same state (before grad school) and that I wished things went differently etc. She took this as me confessing my love and told me 'too bad but I don't feel the same way.' Basically a generic 'friend-zone' response that she has sent to multiple guys before.

I really don't know what to do anymore but it's wearing on me. I have tried to bring things up to talk about what relationship we have and she completely blows me off month after month. And yet I'm still there anytime she needs to talk about issues or even other bf issues (which i told her to not bring up to me multiple times) On one hand I feel like I need to do what's best for me. Which includes slowly cutting her out of my life. On the other hand we've been 'friends' for so long now that I'd feel awful 'abandoning her'. I feel like I love this girl and it sucks. Idk what to do anymore.

TL;DR: Exgf and I have been 'friends' for years, but she refuses to hang out one on one, treats me like a boyfriend via text/phone, but says she doesn't feel the same way. I'm confused and worn down. Should I cut ties or try to make things work?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's using you as a emotional crutch and not a real friend. You deserve better than to be treated like this. It's okay to cut ties and prioritize your own emotional well-being."
2. **relationship_advisor**: "I think you're being too patient and giving her too much space. It's time to set some boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Tell her you want to hang out in person and have a real friendship, and if she's not willing to meet you halfway, it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
3. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you're reading too much into this. She's just not interested in a romantic relationship with you, and that's okay. You can still be friends with her, but you need to accept that it's not going to be a close, intimate friendship like you want. Maybe try to focus on other friendships and hobbies to fill the void."
4. **confused_couple**: "I think you're both stuck in a weird limbo. You're both holding onto the past, but not willing to move forward. Maybe it's time to have a real conversation about what you both want from each other and see if you can find a middle ground. But if she's not willing to meet you halfway, it might be time to accept that it's not meant to be."
5. **realistic_rick**: "Listen, OP, you're 25 and she's 23. You're both adults now, and it's time to stop playing games. If she's not willing to meet you halfway and be a real friend, then it's time to move on. You deserve better than to be strung along like this. Cut ties and focus on building a life with people who actually care about you."

TITLE: TIFU by bumming a guy two smokes

POST: This was about an hour ago, here's some context
I'm at a Mini Makers Fair which is a family oriented event that showcases technology, kids programs and other things associated with "makers".. basically creative tech fair for yuppie families.
Whatever.
I was helping display my friends interactive musical sculpture.

My point is I was at a nice family event and not just hanging out on the streets of downtown or somewhere more likely to get swindled.

I was taking a cigarette break and piddling around on my phone.
A guy cursing, looking into his empty pack spots me and asks if he can "buy a couple smokes off me"
On average the going rate for an American Spirit is $0.35, $0.50 if someone is feeling generous.

I, out of habit, act put off whenever someone tries to bum smokes off me. This is to give them a chance to rescind their offer without me saying "No" outright. 
It's something I started doing with my friends who are chronic bums so they realize I'm not an endless free cigarette machine.

But, the guy offered to buy right? He had his wallet out, right? 
I busted out two smokes for him which he takes with a thanks me briefly.
I'm still kinda absorbed partially in my phone but notice he pauses and then starts to walk away.
"I'll be right back with something for you" he says.

I guess I figured he might work at one of the booths that have some cool, silly swag for me? But I remembered thinking it was weird he took his wallet out and then didn't give me any money.
Maybe he didn't have any single dollar bills?
I waited around for quite awhile after.

Just lame because I'm generally pretty generous but it's situations like this that make that generosity go into hiding for awhile.

TL;DR: Bummed a guy two smokes at a family event, he took them and said he'd be right back with something for me, never came back.

The comments are filled with people sharing their own stories of being taken advantage of or having similar experiences with people trying to bum things off them. Some people offer words of encouragement, telling the OP that they're not a bad person for being cautious, while others share their own tips for dealing with people who try to bum things off them.

One commenter says, "I'm a big believer in being kind and generous, but also being smart about it. If someone asks to borrow something, I always ask them to pay me back or offer to do something in return. It's not about being stingy, it's about being respectful of people's time and resources."

Another commenter shares a story about a time when they were trying to bum a ride from a friend, and the friend ended up giving them a ride and then asking for gas money later. The commenter says, "It's not about being mean, it's about being clear about what you're willing to do and what you're not. If someone asks to borrow something, it's okay to say no or to set boundaries."

The OP's story also sparks a discussion about the importance of being mindful of one's surroundings and not getting too caught up in the moment. One commenter says, "I think it's easy to get caught up in the moment and forget to be aware of your surroundings. But it's important to remember that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you react to them. If someone asks to borrow something, it's okay to say no or to set boundaries."

Overall, the comments are filled with people sharing their own stories and offering words of encouragement and advice. The OP's story serves as a reminder to be mindful of one's surroundings and to set boundaries when necessary.

TITLE: [WA] Landlord failed to transfer power service after promising to do so

POST: I recently switched to a different apartment complex that is owned by my rental company. When I went into the leasing office to sign my new lease I asked if I had to do anything special to change my power utilities account to my new apartment. They said that all I had to do was fill out a form that they had with them, and they would transfer the service for me.

Well, they didn't transfer the service, they only added an account, and I got charged for 2 months of power for an apartment that was leased to someone else. I called my utilities company and they told me to take it up with my rental company and that they couldn't do anything about it. I am going to see my rental company tomorrow, and want them to reimburse me for the two months of electricity.

They have been sort of rigid in the past, does anyone know of any recourse I have against them telling me no?

TL;DR: Landlord promised to transfer power service, but only added a new account and charged me for 2 months of power for an apartment that was leased to someone else. Want to know if I have any recourse against them.

**Legal Advice**

**TL;DR:** You have a valid claim against your landlord for breach of contract and potential negligence. Here's a breakdown of your options:

1. **Contractual Claim:** Your landlord promised to transfer the power service, and they failed to do so. You can argue that this is a breach of contract, and you're entitled to damages (in this case, reimbursement for the two months of electricity).
2. **Negligence Claim:** By not transferring the power service, your landlord may have caused you to incur unnecessary expenses. You can argue that they were negligent in their duty to transfer the service, and you're entitled to compensation for those expenses.
3. **Statute of Limitations:** In California, the statute of limitations for breach of contract is typically 2 years from the date of the breach. Since you're still within that timeframe, you have a valid claim.
4. **Negotiation:** Before taking legal action, try negotiating with your landlord to resolve the issue amicably. Explain your situation, and ask them to reimburse you for the two months of electricity. Be prepared to provide evidence of the breach, such as the original agreement and any communication with the landlord.
5. **Small Claims Court:** If negotiation fails, you can file a small claims lawsuit against your landlord. In California, small claims court has a limit of $10,000, which is sufficient for your claim. You'll need to gather evidence, including receipts and documentation, to support your claim.

**Additional Tips:**

* Keep a record of all communication with your landlord, including emails, phone calls, and meetings.
* Take photos of the original agreement and any relevant documents.
* Be prepared to provide evidence of the breach, including receipts and documentation.
* Consider seeking the advice of an attorney to help you navigate the legal process.

Remember to stay calm and professional when communicating with your landlord. Good luck with your claim!

TITLE: What is this "power play" thing?

POST: So I took a gal out for dinner at a casino. She ordered two appetizers (didn't share), a bunch of drinks, then steak and lobster, which came with a salad. Over the evening she didn't really let me talk, but she mostly complained. She ignored me 28 times to txt on her phone. Our food came and she sent back the lobster and had it replaced with shrimp. So she ate the shrimp, did not eat the steak, nor the accompanying veggies. She gave me an attitude that after we ate when I didn't give her money to gamble. She was really into her video slot so I said I had a good night, and told her I was leaving (politely). She gave me a half hug, did not look up from the machine to make eye contact nor did she thank me. Some other odd things she did: told me to tip more (15% wasn't enough) then complained about the service, how her legs got sweaty because it was too hot, smoked and blew towards me when she knew I am asthmatic, then ordered more complimentary bread at the end of the meal and ate it.

So I walked out of there thinking ok, we didn't click, she wasn't interested in me, I definately wasn't interested in her, as I found her behavior repugnant. No big deal, no big loss. (well actually HER loss) So a friend asked how it went and I said eh, not going to happen. Told him what happened and he said, "oh she pulled a power play on ya." I didn't think much of it at the time, but is that a new dating thing? Kinda like playing hard to get? But instead you act all domineering or self absorbed to get attention?

TL;DR: Took a gal out, she was rude, ignored me, complained, didn't eat her food, and acted entitled. Friend said she "pulled a power play" on me. What does that mean?

---

**Top comments:**

* "Power play" is a term used to describe when someone, usually a woman, uses manipulative behavior to gain control or attention in a relationship. In this case, it seems like your date was using her behavior to assert dominance and get attention from you. It's not a new dating thing, but rather a tactic that some people use to get what they want.
* Yeah, it's definitely not a new thing. I've seen it happen to friends before. It's like they think they can just act entitled and demanding and people will be impressed. Newsflash: it's not attractive.
* I think it's a combination of playing hard to get and being a bit of a diva. She was trying to assert her dominance and get attention from you, but in a really obnoxious way. It's like she was saying, "Hey, I'm important and you should cater to my every whim."
* I've seen this behavior before, and it's usually a sign that the person is not interested in you as a person, but rather as a means to get what they want. It's like they're using you to get attention or to feel important. It's not a healthy or respectful way to interact with someone.
* Yeah, it's definitely not a good sign. If someone is acting like that on the first date, it's probably a sign that they're not going to be a good partner. You dodged a bullet, my friend! *laughs*"

**Original poster's response:**

Thanks for the feedback, guys. I'm glad I'm not the only one who's seen this kind of behavior before. I'm just glad I got out of there before things got any worse. I think I'll be a bit more cautious in the future and pay attention to red flags like this. Thanks for the advice! *thumbs up*

TITLE: Seeking advice for non-traditional co-ed shower

POST: My fiancé and I don't like the notion that the wedding is all about the bride — he's getting married too! So, for instance, we will both be escorted down the aisle. 

My mom and some friends are hosting a wedding shower for us. I am adamant that it is not a *bridal* shower — it's for both of us. In keeping with our non-traditional-ness, **we would like to invite people who are important to us, no matter their genitalia**. 

My mom thinks we should invite all our friends' significant others, since it's a co-ed shower. But some of these people we haven't met or have only met a few times. They certainly wouldn't make the list of "people most important to us." 

Things get a little complicated if we don't invite the SOs, because my mom wants to put "co-ed shower" on the invitation (so she doesn't get inundated with calls like this: "Wait, did you mean to address this to Amy AND John?"), but **I don't want people with long-term SOs to feel shafted because the SO wasn't invited**. We don't exactly want it to be a "couples shower" — just a gathering of people close to us. 

Any advice? Maybe an alternate name we could give the event so people still understand it's a shower and that it's okay to come if you're a man? We don't want the guest list to get so big that it's basically another wedding. (Plus, space is an issue; it'll be held at my parents' house.)

TL;DR: We're having a non-traditional co-ed wedding shower and want to invite people important to us, regardless of gender. How can we handle the guest list and avoid making people feel left out?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's awesome that you're doing this! Why not just have a 'Celebration of Love' or something similar on the invitation? That way, people know it's a party for both of you, and they can bring whoever they want."
* "I love the idea of a 'Celebration of Love'! You could also include a little note on the invitation saying something like 'Please feel free to bring your significant other, friend, or whoever is important to you.' That way, people know it's okay to come with someone, but it's not a couples-only event."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about this. Why not have a 'Housewarming' or 'Newly Engaged' theme instead of a shower? That way, you can invite people who are important to you, and it's not specifically about gifts or bridal shower-y things."
* "I would suggest having a small, intimate gathering with the people who are most important to you, and then having a bigger celebration with all your friends and family later on. That way, you can still have a special moment with the people you care about, and then have a bigger party with everyone else."
* "I think it's awesome that you're doing this! You could also consider having a 'Potluck' or 'Bring Your Favorite Dish' theme, so people can bring something to share and it's not just about gifts. That way, everyone feels included and it's a fun, casual gathering."

---

**The OP's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all so much for your thoughtful comments! We're really glad we're not the only ones who think this is a great idea. We're definitely considering the 'Celebration of Love' name, and the note about bringing significant others or friends. We also like the idea of a 'Housewarming' or 'Newly Engaged' theme, and we might do that instead of a shower. And we love the idea of a potluck or bring-your-favorite-dish theme - that way, everyone can contribute and feel included.

Thanks again for your advice and support. We're really excited to celebrate our love with our friends and family in a way that feels true to us."

POST: I've(18m) never had much luck with girls but I've been shaping up my life together and would like to be a little more adventurous when it comes to the relationship world. I broke up with her(17f) after a 1-1/2 year relationship and told her that this was why, ensuring her that it wasn't her. Obviously she was still upset, and now she's giving me a choice of either actually going my separate way and possibly losing her completely, or being with her. I don't want to be in a committed relationship right now, but I also love her still; neither of these options will work. I'm trying to make my own option, where we remain friends and possibly, after college, think about becoming more serious. Is this possible? And if so, how can I do it?

TL;DR: Broke up with 17-year-old girlfriend after 1-1/2 years, want to remain friends and possibly rekindle in the future, but she's giving me an ultimatum: either we're together or we're nothing. How can I salvage our friendship?

* "Dude, you're 18 and she's 17. That's a huge age gap. You should focus on your own life and not worry about salvaging a relationship with someone who's still in high school."
* "I think you're being a bit selfish here. You broke up with her and now you want to remain friends? That's not fair to her. If you're not ready for a committed relationship, then you should just be honest with her and move on."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but you need to be realistic. She's 17 and you're 18. You're at different stages of your lives. It's unlikely that you'll be able to maintain a healthy friendship with someone who's still in high school. You should focus on your own life and not worry about salvaging a relationship that's already ended."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Let her know that you still care about her, but you're not ready for a committed relationship right now. You can also let her know that you value your friendship and would like to maintain it. It's possible that she'll understand and be willing to work with you to find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I'm not sure if this is the right approach, but you could try to set some boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Let her know that you're not ready for a committed relationship, but you still value your friendship and would like to maintain it. You can also let her know that you're willing to work with her to find a solution that works for both of you. It's possible that she'll understand and be willing to work with you to find a solution that works for both of you."

**Edit:** I've been thinking about this a lot and I think I'm going to try to have an open and honest conversation with her about my feelings. I'll let her know that I still care about her, but I'm not ready for a committed relationship right now. I'll also let her know that I value our friendship and would like to maintain it.

POST: Someone I consider to be a best friend and I actually "met" here through reddit. Some time later, we decided to meet despite a great distance between the areas we live in. After spending time together in person, we discovered deeper feelings we have for each other, and I think we were both a bit surprised. It was very intense and very real. 

Now, he is back and we're apart again. I thought it would be fine because we could still talk, skype, etc. Not the same, but I'd rather have someone like that in my life in some way than not at all. Well, he is asking if we can "cool off." I'm so confused! We had conversations before parting that we would continue talking, that things wouldn't change, etc. 

Do I just back off for awhile and wait? Do I cut all contact?

Part of me wants to say "forget it," because I was probably was being naive and stupid, but then our friendship alone means a lot.

I'm sorry this is vague and probably a rambled mess.

TL;DR: Best friend and I discovered deeper feelings, he went home, now wants to step back. I'm confused about how to handle it.

TITLE: CC transfer student need help with deciding on major.

POST: Hey everyone, 

This is my third year at community college and I'm going to be applying to colleges this year. 

Throughout the years at community college, I've been thinking about what kind of major I should be doing or career path after college. I've never had solid grasp on what I wanted to do, so I usually followed what my parents and friends guided me towards. 

In my first year at CC I thought about majoring in computer science, but after taking some programming classes I was shocked to find out it was completely different from what I thought computer science was. 

Then in my second year, I thought about doing electrical engineering because my dad told me it was a safe and stable major to choose, also because he works in a engineering company himself. I thought to myself this was going to be the major I'm gonna stick to, but after getting obliterated by physics classes I was discouraged and changed my mind about engineering major. 

Now here I am in my third year, still debating what major I should be considering. However, I was considering maybe majoring in mathematics because it is somewhat related to a career path I was interested in, which is cryptography.  

However, I've read about some stories about math majors who've went onto upper division classes and ended up changing their majors because it was not what they expected. I'm aware of what the upper division courses for maths are like because I've looked up some problems people post, and it does terrify me quite a bit. 

I guess I'm worried because if I do end up majoring in mathematics, I may end up switching my major when I transfer because I don't have enough guts to handle it. 

I'm sure a lot of people on here had similar problems or anxiety like me, having doubts about one's ability, how did you guys decide on your major and what advice can you guys give me? 

Sorry for my disorganized post, my thoughts are jumbled up so I can't put together my thoughts well together. I appreciate any feedback or comments.

TL;DR: CC transfer student struggling to decide on major, considering math but worried about upper division courses, seeking advice from others who had similar struggles.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Hey OP, I totally understand where you're coming from. I changed my major three times before I finally settled on something I loved. My advice is to take some electives in different departments and see what you enjoy. You don't have to declare a major right away, and it's okay to change your mind. Also, don't be afraid to talk to your advisors and professors about your concerns. They're there to help you!
2. **u/EngineeringStudent**: Hey OP, I'm an engineering student and I can relate to your struggles with physics classes. But I want to tell you that it's normal to struggle, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to be a genius to succeed in engineering. Just keep at it, and you'll get the hang of it. And if you're still unsure, you can always take a break or switch to a different major.
3. **u/Mathtastic**: OP, I'm a math major and I can assure you that it's not as scary as it seems. The upper division courses are challenging, but they're also really rewarding. If you're interested in cryptography, you should definitely consider majoring in math. It's a great field, and there are many job opportunities. Just be prepared to put in the work, and you'll be fine.
4. **u/CollegeLife**: Hey OP, I'm a college student and I've been in your shoes before. My advice is to take some time to reflect on what you really want to do. What are your passions? What are your strengths? What kind of career do you want to have? Once you have a better idea of what you want, you can start looking at majors that align with your goals. And don't be afraid to seek advice from your advisors and professors. They can help you make an informed decision.
5. **u/CCStudent**: Hey OP, I'm a CC student and I'm going to transfer to a four-year college soon. My advice is to take some electives in different departments and see what you enjoy. You don't have to declare a major right away, and it's okay to change your mind. Also, don't be afraid to talk to your advisors and professors about your concerns. They're there to help you! And if you're still unsure, you can always take a break or switch to a different major.

**Postscript:**

The OP (original poster) thanked everyone for their comments and advice. They said that they would take some time to reflect on their interests and strengths, and then make a decision about their major. They also mentioned that they would keep an eye on the comments and respond if they had any further questions or concerns.

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm 18 and I've had a crush on this girl for a while now. She's 18 too, and we've become friends through mutual friends. I think she's really cool and I enjoy talking to her. I've been thinking about asking her out on a date, but I'm really nervous about it. I don't want to mess it up or make it awkward.

I've been thinking about asking her out for a while now, but I just can't seem to muster up the courage to do it. I've been trying to come up with a plan, but I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be too pushy or too shy. I just want to be myself and see if there's a connection between us.

Thanks in advance for your help!

* "Don't overthink it, man. Just ask her out and see what happens. If she says no, you can always try again or move on. But if she says yes, you'll be glad you took the chance."

TITLE: Me [20 M] really depressed, can't get ex off my mind, can't seem to want to move on.

POST: My ex dumped me about a month and a half ago. I have been with three women in the past three weeks but it really does not feel the same at all. I talked to my ex on the phone about a week ago, just telling her that her new boyfriend is a piece of shit and that he's brainwashing her into not talking to me, etc. It might sound crazy but the only reason I was with those other women was because I thought it would win back this ex that I was seeing a lot for 2 months.

Should I write my ex a love letter telling her how I feel? Should I call her once a day? Or should I just move on and try to find another girl like her? I do not want her to be the one that got away, and cannot seem to move on no matter how hard I try. She was basically my polar opposite, but I suppose that's why we were so attracted to each other.

Does true love just fade away? Why hasn't she even attempted to contact me this past month and a half when that's all I've been trying to do is to get a hold of her. Life seems so meaningless without her and I really don't know how to deal anymore. There are tons of suitable partners around me but I don't feel the same way about them to any degree.

I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. I love her, she loves me, but she can't seem to get over the fact that I asked if she was being unfaithful a couple of times. When the fight occurred I was 2 weeks behind on all of my school work and in the middle of a project, so I was stressed as hell in the first place, and then she being REALLY SARCASTIC which I struggle with regardless. These two things coupled together make me unbelievably furious, and I completely over-reacted. Not to mention how little sleep I was getting while I was with her. Should I be afraid to just show up to her house and give her the love letter I've been working on?

TL;DR: Ex dumped me 1.5 months ago, I'm really depressed, can't seem to move on, and I'm thinking of writing a love letter to try and win her back. Should I do it? Should I just move on and find another girl like her? I love her, but I know I messed up and I'm not sure if I should be afraid to show up at her house and give her the letter.

**Community Response:**

The community responds with a mix of empathy, concern, and advice. Some users encourage the OP to focus on his own healing and moving on, while others suggest that he may be holding onto the past too tightly.

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's clear you're still really hurting. I think you need to take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. Try to figure out what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. Don't be afraid to take some time for yourself and prioritize your own healing."
* "I understand why you'd want to write a love letter, but I think you need to be honest with yourself - you're not doing this to win her back, you're doing it because you're still holding onto the past. You need to let go and move on. There are plenty of other people out there who can love and appreciate you for who you are."
* "I think you should take a break from social media and focus on yourself for a bit. It's clear you're still really invested in this relationship and it's not healthy for you. Try to find some new hobbies or interests and focus on building yourself up as a person. You'll be surprised at how much better you'll feel when you're not constantly thinking about your ex."
* "I'm not saying you should write a love letter or show up at her house, but I do think you should be honest with yourself about why you're still holding onto this relationship. Are you really doing it because you love her, or are you doing it because you're scared of being alone? You need to figure out what's driving your behavior and make some changes."
* "I think you should try to focus on the positive aspects of your life right now. You're young, you're healthy, and you have a lot to offer. Instead of dwelling on what could have been, try to focus on what you can control and what you can do to make yourself happy. You don't need to be with someone else to be happy - you just need to find what makes you happy and go after it."

Overall, the community is trying to encourage the OP to focus on his own healing and moving on, rather than holding onto the past and trying to win his ex back. They're suggesting that he take a step back, prioritize his own well-being, and focus on building himself up as a person. Some users are also encouraging him to be honest with himself about why he's still holding onto the relationship and to think about what he can control and what he can do to make himself happy.

POST: Me and my girlfriend we're in the back of my car making out when she says she has to go home to check in, I being the idiot I am convince her to stay a couple min. Acouple min later the unthinkable happens her nazi of a mother rolls up and taps on the window. Her mom takes her home and gets her phone taken away along with most of her stuff. so we don't talk till Monday(happened on Friday, and we don't talk at all barely made eye contact in our same class. And don't talk at practice. When I confronted her about not talking at all. She said that she can't get in anymore trouble, and that it's complicated. What does this mean?? Is there another guy? Did this one incident and three days just kill the whole thing?

TL;DR: Girlfriend's mom shows up, takes away phone and stuff, and we don't talk for three days. She says it's complicated and can't get in trouble again. What's going on?

**Comments:**

* "Sounds like her mom is a real piece of work. Has she ever been abusive or controlling towards her daughter?"
* "I think you should have a calm conversation with her about what's going on. Ask her what's complicated and what kind of trouble she's talking about."
* "It's possible that her mom is just trying to control her daughter's life and you're getting caught in the middle. You might want to consider having a talk with her mom too."
* "I think you should give her some space and let her figure things out on her own. It sounds like she's going through a tough time and doesn't need you adding to the stress."
* "Has she ever talked about her mom being controlling or abusive? It might be worth asking her about that."
* "You might want to consider having a conversation with her about boundaries and what she's comfortable with in terms of her mom's involvement in their relationship."
* "It's possible that she's just really scared of her mom and doesn't know how to deal with the situation. You might want to be patient and understanding and see if you can help her work through her feelings."

**OP's Response:**

* "Thanks for the advice guys. Yeah, her mom has always been a bit controlling, but I never thought it was that bad. I'll try to have a calm conversation with her and see what's going on. And yeah, I'll definitely ask her about boundaries and what she's comfortable with. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: TIFU by sending my girlfriend a photo of a shirt

POST: So, this just happened two weeks ago, and I'm just now facing the shit-storm.

My girlfriend does wild land firefighting. Well, so needless to say we are in a short-term long distance relationship. 

Back story: her and I have been friends for two years. We got together in March (Pi Day!), and she spent her vacation with me during spring break. Well, she and I had lots of sex and clothes were thrown everywhere.

Last week I was cleaning my room and I found a shirt at the foot of my bed, but inside the corner of the bed frame. So, I sent my girlfriend picture of said shirt and said, "You left this here." Well, she went home yesterday, and started looking through her stuff, and she had both shirts she had brought.

She sent me a text that said, "We need to talk." This is also known as, "The four words that make your buttcheeks clench." She calls me and tells me she has both shirts and has no idea whose shirt I have. I told her, "Well, that makes two of us." I honestly don't know. 

I'm not fucking around on her. The last time I had sex was in December (more than likely this one's), and then there was that fooling around thing with that girl from work at the beginning of January, but no sex happened. I'm not fooling around on her, but I don't want her to feel like I am.

Her tone says she is going to let it go, but I'm not trying to give her a reason to doubt me.

TL;DR: Sent my girlfriend a picture of a shirt I found in my room, and now she's upset because she has no idea whose shirt it is.

TITLE: Am I (21f) doing what is right for my daughter (3f) now that her father (23m) is dead or am I just ruining her life and my chances at potential relationships?

POST: My daughter is 3. Her dad (23m) is dead. Her dad and I(21f) were no longer together,(we were together two years but had been broken up for two years) however I am closer to his family than my own due to years of abuse and neglect with my family.

Multiple different men (26m&28m) are saying that if I want things to work out with him then I would need to cut my daughter's dad's family out of both of our lives because he and his family is going to take over their role.

 (Just to be clear I am not slutting around a lot, my daughter hasn't met any of these men... I just start talking to a guy, make it clear about her dad's family's role in her life and they basically tell me how they are going to take over that role and how her dad's family will start to not be involved. Then due to them saying how they don't want her dad's family in our lives I stop talking to them because I love her dad's family.)

Their basic reasoning is that her dad's family would undermine him and compare him to her deceased dad all the time. He doesn't know her dad's family and I know for a fact they never would. Also, the other part is that he believes he would become her only dad because he will be the one there for the majority of her life.. I feel as if they are wanting me to pretend her dad never existed and I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Am I being unrealistic thinking that all of this is wrong and that I need to avoid talking about my daughter's biological dad around her? Should I be acting like he never existed? I thought I was in the right to keep his spirit alive with my daughter because she really does act like her dad. And because I don't want her to forget him. But now I am worried that my view on this is skewed.

TL;DR: I'm a 21-year-old single mom whose 3-year-old daughter's father is dead. I'm close to his family due to my own family issues. New guys I meet tell me I need to cut them out of our lives to make things work with them. I'm worried I'm being unrealistic for wanting to keep her dad's memory alive and not wanting to act like he never existed. Am I doing the right thing or am I ruining my daughter's life and my own chances at relationships?

**Community Response:**

The community is divided on this issue, with some users agreeing with the OP's decision to keep her daughter's father's memory alive and others believing that it's best for her daughter to move on and focus on her new family.

Some users suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with her daughter about her father's death and the importance of keeping his memory alive, while others believe that it's best to focus on the present and future, rather than dwelling on the past.

A few users also suggest that the OP should consider seeking professional help to deal with her own feelings and emotions about her daughter's father's death, as well as to get advice on how to navigate this situation.

**Top Comments:**

* "I think you're being realistic about wanting to keep your daughter's father's memory alive. It's important for her to know about him and to have a sense of connection to him, even if he's not physically present. It's also important for you to have a sense of closure and to be able to move forward with your life." - u/throwaway1234567
* "I understand where you're coming from, but I think it's important to consider your daughter's feelings and needs as well. She's only 3, and she may not fully understand the concept of death or the importance of keeping her father's memory alive. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about her father and how she can still feel connected to him, even if he's not physically present." - u/momofthree
* "I think you're being unrealistic about expecting new guys to accept and understand your daughter's father's family. It's not their responsibility to deal with your family drama, and it's not fair to expect them to. You need to focus on your own healing and moving forward, rather than trying to control how others react to your situation." - u/skeptical_sarah
* "I think you should consider seeking professional help to deal with your feelings and emotions about your daughter's father's death. It's a difficult and complex situation, and it may be helpful to have a professional to talk to and get advice from. Additionally, you may want to consider seeking support from other parents who have experienced a similar loss." - u/therapist123

**Conclusion:**

The community is divided on this issue, with some users agreeing with the OP's decision to keep her daughter's father's memory alive and others believing that it's best for her daughter to move on and focus on her new family. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP and what she feels is best for her daughter. It may be helpful for her to seek professional help and to have an open and honest conversation with her daughter about her father's death and the importance of keeping his memory alive.

TITLE: My [15 M] and my friend [15 M] have been acting "gay" for each other as a joke between us, but he just came out and is actually gay.

POST: I have been friends with this person for a few months now, and we honestly get along very well. He's a funny guy, and we play a lot o' games together as bros. Whenever we're out together or at some sort of group gathering, we jokingly always act as though we are secretly deeply in love with each other and get all touchy. And up until now I thought he was straight, so I didn't really think much of it. (For reference, I am a bi-curious straight male.)

Anyway, today he finally came out to me and a select few as gay after realizing he felt this way roughly 2.5 years ago. I was really happy for him, because it was honestly a huge weight off his shoulders and it makes me happy knowing that he feels better about this. However, now I feel incredibly awkward. I'm not sure whether or not it's still okay to do the whole "gay couple" act with him at this point, because I don't want to play with his feelings like that knowing that it might not necessarily be an act on his part.

I am going to try talking to him when I get the chance and see what he says, but he's notorious for not giving very clear answers and I don't want to pressure him so soon after he has built up the courage to come out to me and a few others. But I don't know whether or not it's still okay to do this, and I'm not sure whether or not he might even have feelings for me, since he doesn't really do the "gay couple" thing with anyone else. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

TL;DR: My friend of 3 months just came out as gay, and we used to joke around about being in love with each other. I'm not sure if it's still okay to do this, and I don't know if he has feelings for me. Help me figure out what to do.

This post is a great example of how to share a personal and potentially awkward situation in a respectful and thoughtful way. The OP (original poster) is honest about their feelings and concerns, and they're seeking advice from others who may have experienced similar situations.

TITLE: A question of character

POST: I (24f) have lived a very sheltered life,have been quite abused (in all categories), and struggle with many health issues. What I am beginning to see in not just my SO of 5 years but others is how different their characters are from mine. 

Friends, it does not really bother me much. I mean i sometimes trip out on what they say and their selection of words but I don't seem to judge them as much as my SO (obviously). 

I have been noticing that my SO, in various situations would do something that in my opinion would be morally wrong. The thing is, all of them are literally hypothetical. Like we would watch a movie or read about something and he would say, "oh if that was me I would have totally done blahblahblah". Usually the blahblahblah part is something that I find totally the wrong thing to do morally. 

I was raised in a very abusive household and yet i'd not hesitate to open doors for elderly, try to help out homeless, and I am not against the world at all. My SO is opposite but he is totally affectionate to me and it just seems like his words do not match his actions towards me and those who are close. 

Should I be worried about this? I understand everyone is different and I totally respect people for their choices but it just seems like my SO would be a villain in most hypothetical situations whereas, I would be a hero. 

Has anyone ever encountered something like this? Is it a red flag? I mean he has loved me through all my faults, disabilities and handicaps which I think takes someone special to do so. Also, he is not abusive or negative to me or anyone at all.

TL;DR: I'm noticing my SO's hypothetical moral compass is very different from mine. He says he would do things I find morally wrong, but in real life he's kind and loving. Should I be worried?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think it's normal for people to have different moral compasses, and it's great that your SO is kind and loving in real life. The fact that he's not abusive or negative towards you or others is a huge plus. I wouldn't worry too much about it, but maybe have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. It's possible he's just not thinking about the hypothetical scenarios in the same way you are, and it could be an interesting conversation to have."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I think it's great that you're recognizing the differences in your moral compasses and having an open mind about it. It's not uncommon for people to have different values and beliefs, and it's not necessarily a red flag. However, it's still important to communicate with your SO about your concerns and make sure you're both on the same page. Maybe you could have a conversation about what you find morally wrong about his hypothetical scenarios and why, and see if you can find common ground."
3. **ConcernedFriend**: "I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with your SO about your concerns, but I wouldn't say it's a red flag necessarily. It's possible that he's just not thinking about the hypothetical scenarios in the same way you are, and it could be an interesting conversation to have. However, if you're feeling uncomfortable or unsure about his values and beliefs, it might be worth exploring further. Maybe you could ask him about his values and beliefs and see if they align with yours."

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [22F] says she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. What should I do?

POST: Just like it says on the tin. My SO of 2.5 years recently admitted to me that she didn't initially find me attractive, although she claims that changed after she got to know me.

I certainly understand that a person's overall attractiveness is a function of their personality, and one's level of attraction to a person can change over time, I'm very upset that she never felt any *physical* attraction for me. 

It's great that she's "attracted" by my personality and all, but I can't help but feel that this isn't good enough. I thought she was physically attractive right away. I feel pretty terrible about myself that she didn't feel the same way. I don't want to go on in a relationship where I feel that I'm not good enough for her.

I still love her very much, and I know she loves me. I'm pretty crushed at finding this out, and I don't know what to do about it. It seems to me that she was immature to think she could have a satisfying relationship with someone she didn't click with physically. I want her to be happy, so I can't help but wonder if we need to break it off so she can find someone who actually works for her physically.

Is this an overreaction? I think I'm emotionally compromised because I'm so upset about this. So I'm hoping for advice from a few smart people here.

What should I do? Is there a way of understanding what she's told me that doesn't make it sound so bad? What am I missing?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 2.5 years says she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. I'm upset and feel like I'm not good enough for her. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, I think you're overreacting a bit. It's not uncommon for people to take time to develop physical attraction to someone. It's not like she said she never found you attractive at all, just that it took her a while. You're still in a relationship, and you're still happy, so maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship instead of dwelling on this one thing.
2. **skeptical_sam**: I agree with throwaway123456. It's not like she said she never found you attractive, and it's not like you're not good enough for her. You're still in a relationship, and you're still happy. Maybe try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't assume the worst just yet.
3. **confused_couple**: OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on the physical aspect of your relationship. It's not like she said she never found you attractive at all, and it's not like you're not good enough for her. You're still in a relationship, and you're still happy. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship instead of dwelling on this one thing.
4. **disappointed_dude**: OP, I think you're being a bit too sensitive about this. It's not like she said she never found you attractive at all, and it's not like you're not good enough for her. You're still in a relationship, and you're still happy. Maybe try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling, but don't assume the worst just yet.
5. **sad_sack**: OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on the physical aspect of your relationship. It's not like she said she never found you attractive at all, and it's not like you're not good enough for her. You're still in a relationship, and you're still happy. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship instead of dwelling on this one thing.

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are generally in agreement that the OP is overreacting and that it's not a big deal that his girlfriend wasn't initially physically attracted to him. They suggest that he focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how he's feeling. The comments also suggest that it's not uncommon for people to take time to develop physical attraction to someone, and that it's not necessarily a reflection of their worth as a person. Overall, the comments are encouraging the OP to take a more balanced and rational approach to the situation.

TITLE: How did you escape disaster? I'll start.

POST: 8 years ago, as a sophmore, me and my buddies went to his car and smoked a bowl between classes, we show up to our next class about 5 minutes late, and the teacher being a bitch said we had to go to the office and sign in, so we do, and the office secretary obviously knew we were high so about 10 minutes after signing in, we're called into the office, I had a pipe and a 10 sack in my backpack so at this point I was shitting bricks, they placed me in this small ass 4x4 printer room with the yard duty. I knew I was screwed because the room was so small I had no chance to hide my stuff. I opened the small pocket of my backpack where everything was, and took out a pencil. I started twirling the pencil around in my hand and noticed that the yard duty was watching the pencil, so i keep doing that and then I flick it up in the air. As it falls to the ground, I reach for it, and with my other hand I grab my pipe and slide it under the printer. When my principal was done interrogating my friend I was called in. She had just escorted him to another room to sit until they figured out to do with us. I walk out the printer room, see she is across the room from her office, so I B-line into her office grab the weed and put it on the book case. Cop gets called in to search my things, and he's tripping because he keeps saying he could smell it. It was literally behind his head nose level. After searching my stuff 4 times he gives up. They lock me in the office and tell me to wait while the police officer talks to my principle. When I was alone for about 5 minutes, I took the weed off the bookcase and hid it in her desk drawer. I ended up getting suspended for being high and they tried to tell my mom I have a drug problem and wanted me to go to rehab. My mom pretty much laughed in her face and told her it's just marijuana. Never heard about it again, but the teacher did "resign" at the end of the year.

TL;DR: Got caught with weed in school, used a pencil to distract the yard duty and hid the pipe under the printer, then hid the weed in the principal's desk drawer. Got suspended but my mom didn't buy the "I have a drug problem" story.

TITLE: Moved into guy's Apt and Moving Out 1 month in. Who finds replacement?

POST: Hello,
I don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.

My question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- 
•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?
•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?
•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?
•	How can I protect myself in this situation?

I literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.

If I posted in to the incorrect subreddit, lemme know.

Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!

TL;DR: Moved into a guy's apartment on a month-to-month basis, realized it's not great, found a cheaper place with friends. Who finds a replacement? How much notice should I give? Should I tell my roommate why I'm leaving? How can I protect myself?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'd say it's generally the responsibility of the person moving out to find a replacement. You're not obligated to, but it's considered polite to help out your roommate. As for notice, a week or two is usually sufficient. You can tell your roommate you're leaving because you found a better opportunity, but don't go into too much detail. Just be honest and respectful. As for protecting yourself, make sure you're out of the apartment by the agreed-upon date and leave it in the same condition it was in when you moved in. You can also offer to help your roommate find a new tenant, but don't feel obligated to do so."
2. **u/LawStudent99**: "OP, you're in a bit of a tricky situation. Since you didn't sign a lease, you don't have any legal obligations to your roommate. However, it's still important to be respectful and give your roommate some notice. I'd suggest giving them a week or two's notice, and then start looking for a replacement. You can tell your roommate you're leaving because you found a better opportunity, but don't go into too much detail. As for protecting yourself, make sure you're out of the apartment by the agreed-upon date and leave it in the same condition it was in when you moved in. You can also offer to help your roommate find a new tenant, but don't feel obligated to do so."
3. **u/renterproblems**: "OP, I feel your pain. I've been in similar situations before. My advice is to be honest with your roommate, but don't go into too much detail. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've found a better opportunity and I'm going to be moving out.' Don't mention the condition of the apartment or your roommate's lack of motivation. Just be respectful and give them some notice. As for protecting yourself, make sure you're out of the apartment by the agreed-upon date and leave it in the same condition it was in when you moved in. You can also offer to help your roommate find a new tenant, but don't feel obligated to do so."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll give my roommate a week's notice and start looking for a replacement. I'll be honest with him, but I won't go into too much detail. I'll make sure to leave the apartment in the same condition it was in when I moved in and offer to help him find a new tenant. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: I [m/18] got involved with a girl [f/19] in a relationship, but she doesn't know how to leave her bf.

POST: A couple of months ago a friend and I started developing feelings for each other. She had been in a relationship of 3 years and often told me how unhappy she was with the relationship and how poorly he treats her. Things between us started getting serious and their relationship started falling apart. 

Being college students on winter break, we began hanging out every day for the past month. I could tell she was finally accepting that she could leave him. We make each other very happy and often discussed our own relationship and the future. 

Just as I thought she was finally mustering up the strength to end it with him, his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Being together with him for 3 years, she is very close with his family and thinks leaving him would be too much for him to handle. She told me she doesn't want to lose me but can't risk hurting him right now. 

Obviously it's a difficult situation and I'm understanding, but I can't help being upset knowing that she isn't happy. I want to make her happy and I know I can but I'm not sure what to do at this point. And no, I don't want to hear that I shouldn't have gotten involved with her in the first place.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is unhappy in her 3-year relationship, but is hesitant to leave due to her boyfriend's family situation. She's developing feelings for me, but is torn between her loyalty to her boyfriend and her own happiness.

**Comments:**

* "I get where she's coming from, but it's not fair to you. You deserve someone who is happy and willing to be with you. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and see if she comes around when she's ready to prioritize her own happiness."
* "It's not your problem to fix. If she's not happy, it's on her to make a change. You can't force someone to leave a relationship, and it's not your responsibility to make her happy. You deserve someone who is happy with you, not someone who is stuck in a toxic relationship."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you care about her and want her to be happy, but you can't keep waiting around for her to make a decision. You deserve to know where you stand and what she wants."
* "It's not about being 'fair' to you. It's about her own happiness and well-being. If she's not happy, it's not because of you or because of him, it's because she's stuck in a toxic relationship. You can't fix that, but you can be there for her and support her when she's ready to make a change."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings for her. If you're willing to wait around for her to make a decision, that's a sign that you're not prioritizing your own happiness. You deserve someone who is happy and willing to be with you, not someone who is stuck in a toxic relationship." 

**Notable points:**

* Many commenters acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of making a decision.
* Some commenters emphasize the importance of prioritizing one's own happiness and well-being.
* Others suggest having an open and honest conversation with the girlfriend about feelings and expectations.

Ultimately, the decision of what to do in this situation is complex and personal, and can only be made by the individuals involved.

* The OP should also consider prioritizing his own happiness and well-being, and not waiting around for the girlfriend to make a decision.

TITLE: 19f with fiance 20m and roommate 19m- fiance and I recently got infected with scabies and have started treatment, roommate refuses

POST: Recently, my fiance  (20 m) and I (19f) moved into a new apartment with a mutual friend (20m) and somehow contracted scabies (don't know how). We've both been itchy af and have been to the doctor who confirmed that it was scabies for the both of us. Our room mate (20m) has not had symptoms of scabies bites appear yet but I have asked him to get treated as well and to treat his clothes and linen so that our apartment does not get reinfested after treatment.

My room mate refuses to buy the lotion needed to kill the mites on his skin (if there are any on him) and refuses to rewash and dry his linen and clothes. I'm scared that if he does not get treated the infestation of our apartment will not go away. I'm almost there to asking him to move out if he refuses treatment. He is not on the lease.

TL;DR: Fiance and I got scabies, roommate refuses to get treated and refuses to take steps to prevent reinfestation. What do I do?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I would have a calm but firm conversation with your roommate. Explain the risks of not treating the infestation and how it can affect everyone in the apartment. If he still refuses, it might be best to consider finding a new roommate or having a serious talk with your fiance about whether this is a deal-breaker for you."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I'm so sorry you're going through this! It's understandable that you're worried about the infestation. Have you considered talking to your roommate about how this is affecting you and your fiance? Maybe he's not aware of the impact his refusal is having. Also, have you thought about having a mediator, like a mutual friend, help facilitate the conversation?"
3. **u/ScabiesSurvivor**: "Oh man, I went through this too! It's super frustrating. I would suggest having a'scabies meeting' with your roommate and explaining the risks of not treating it. You can also offer to help him get the lotion and do the laundry together. If he still refuses, it might be time to reevaluate the living situation."
4. **u/roommateproblems**: "I've had similar issues with roommates in the past. I would say that since he's not on the lease, you have the right to ask him to move out if he's not willing to contribute to the well-being of the apartment. You can also consider talking to your fiance about whether you're comfortable living with someone who's not willing to take care of themselves and the apartment."
5. **u/healthyliving**: "I'm a health enthusiast, and I have to say that it's really concerning that your roommate is refusing to take care of his health and the health of others in the apartment. I would suggest having a serious talk with him about the importance of hygiene and public health. If he still refuses, it might be best to find a new roommate who prioritizes health and wellness."

TITLE: My best friend's boyfriend is being controlling. Breaking me and my best friend apart. Any ideas?

POST: I'm 17, she's 17. Her boyfriend is 16. Me and her hang out constantly, we also share some classes together. I've also known her longer (1year). They share no classes, he's younger, and they've been dating for 1 month. 
The thing is, I write a FACEBOOK post about her and I jump-starting her car because we killed her battery;

And he gets off on a storm to her about how that's "disloyal" or something. 
He's messaging me now as we speak about the post and how he "doesn't want any problems, because it's our 1month anniversary". Fuck his problems. Any advice on what I should do? I understand that I should respect their relationship, AND I DO. But the fact that he got worked up over that is a red flag to me.

TL;DR: Best friend's boyfriend is being controlling, getting worked up over a harmless Facebook post. What should I do?

---

This post is a great example of how a seemingly harmless situation can escalate into a complex issue. The OP (original poster) is caught in the middle of their best friend's relationship, and they're unsure of how to handle the situation.

The controlling behavior exhibited by the boyfriend is a red flag, and it's affecting the OP's relationship with their best friend. The boyfriend's reaction to the Facebook post is an example of how he's trying to exert control over the situation and dictate what the OP can and can't do.

The OP is right to be concerned about the situation, and they're seeking advice on how to navigate it. The post is a great example of how a subreddit like r/relationships can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their concerns and get advice from others who have experienced similar situations.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* "It sounds like the boyfriend is trying to control your friend and you. You should talk to your friend about how you're feeling and see if she's aware of his behavior."
* "It's not your responsibility to deal with the boyfriend's drama. Focus on your friendship with your best friend and try to avoid getting caught in the middle."
* "You should try to talk to the boyfriend and explain how his behavior is affecting you and your friendship with your best friend. Maybe he's not even aware of how he's coming across."

Overall, this post is a great example of how a subreddit like r/relationships can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their concerns and get advice from others who have experienced similar situations.

TITLE: Giving my[29m] gf/fiance [23f] an ultimatum - am I wrong?

POST: She has extremely controlling/manipulative parents, and she's from a foreign culture. In practice, this means that she can't actually do anything with me beyond spending a few hours together, though we've been a couple for the past couple years. "It's not right" for her to spend the night at my place, even though I reside pretty far away; "It's not right" for her to go on a trip with me to visit my family in Los Angeles, which is pretty far from the Midwest; "It's not right" for us to go on weekend trips, because that would look bad to the gossipy neighbors/community.

This is from her and her parents. I asked her to get married a while ago, and she agreed, though said she wouldn't tell her parents until after she got her Master's degree, which is a couple years from now, as she somehow owes it to them to finish not just a regular college career, but all of graduate school, before she gets married.

It's been a while, and I have her the ultimatum: either we get married next year, you give up this cultural stuff that keeps us apart and actually do some things with me, or we part ways.

She's upset, of course, and doesn't like that I've given her such an ultimatum. I feel guilty about it; should I? Am I doing the wrong thing? I love her, but I don't know how long I can go with this semi-relationship dominated by the wishes and desires of her parents (who, by the way, she resides with).

TL;DR: Fiancee's controlling parents dictate what we can and can't do as a couple. I've given her an ultimatum: get married, break free from her parents' control, or we part ways. I feel guilty, but I don't know how much longer I can tolerate this.

**Comments:**

* "You're not wrong for giving her an ultimatum, but you might be wrong for expecting her to change her entire life and break free from her parents' control overnight. Have you considered counseling to work through these issues together?"
* "I think you're being unfair. You're putting a lot of pressure on her to change her entire life, and it's not fair to expect her to give up her cultural heritage and family ties just to please you. Maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with her and her family instead of trying to change them."
* "I'm with OP. I've been in a similar situation and it's exhausting and suffocating. You deserve better than to be treated like a side dish. If she can't stand up to her parents and prioritize your relationship, then maybe she's not the right person for you."
* "OP, you're not wrong for wanting to be with someone who can make their own decisions and prioritize your relationship. But maybe you should consider the fact that her parents are controlling and manipulative, and that's not something you can change. Have you considered that maybe she's not the one who's the problem, but rather her parents?"
* "I think you're being too rigid. Marriage is a big step, and it's not something you should rush into just because you're feeling suffocated. Maybe you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities and what you want from your relationship."

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I appreciate the feedback. I guess I was expecting a more straightforward "yes, you're right" or "no, you're wrong" response, but I realize now that relationships are complex and multifaceted.

I think I might have been too rigid with my ultimatum, and I can see how it might be perceived as unfair. I do love her, and I want to work through these issues with her, but I also feel like I've been patient for too long and it's time for some progress.

I'm going to take some time to reflect on my priorities and what I want from my relationship. Maybe I'll consider counseling, as someone suggested. Thanks again for your input! I'll keep you all updated on how things go.

**Follow-up Post:**

Update: I had a long talk with my girlfriend, and we're going to try counseling together. We're both willing to work on our communication and boundaries, and we're hoping that counseling will help us find a way to make our relationship work despite the challenges posed by her parents.

I'm still a bit uncertain about the future, but I'm feeling more hopeful than I did a week ago. Thanks again for your support and advice! I'll keep you all updated on how things go.

**Conclusion:**

The original poster's post sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many commenters offering their opinions and advice. While some people felt that the OP was being unfair and rigid, others understood his frustration and felt that he was justified in giving his girlfriend an ultimatum.

Ultimately, the OP decided to take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities and what he wanted from his relationship. He and his girlfriend decided to try counseling together, which may help them work through their issues and find a way to make their relationship work despite the challenges posed by her parents.

The post serves as a reminder that relationships are complex and multifaceted, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the challenges that couples may face. It also highlights the importance of communication, empathy, and understanding in building a strong and healthy relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by getting run over by an ice cream truck

POST: So, obligatory this did not happen today.

You should know I'm a guy with his pride. So when my SO started mocking my coordination for tripping over stuff, I got pretty mad and decided to prove to her that my coordination is perfect. Needless to say, just a few days later I was roaming the neighbourhood on my brand new unicycle while juggling some tennis balls (3, to be exact). 

That's where the fuckup begins. One sunny day I was riding around the area when suddenly this ice cream truck appears from behind the corner and heads for me. I could do nothing but watch the kid behind the steering wheel desperately try to stop the truck - luckily, at the last moment he realised he can simply turn the wheel, so he did not break every single one of my bones, just a few ribs and a hip dislocation. 

Turns out was also the time when a lot of illegal immigrants began to come over here - god bless you, Merkel - so some employers felt like it was a perfect opportunity and 'hired' many those people for some shitty money without any contract or training. What's even worse is that the kid driving was quite literally this - a kid. 

We finally agreed not to call the police after he promised me a free vanilla scoop every time he was around. My SO was super mad and my unicycle went straight to the garbage can, but damn me if it wasn't worth it.

TL;DR: I got run over by an ice cream truck while juggling tennis balls on my unicycle to prove my coordination to my SO. The kid driving the truck was an illegal immigrant and we agreed not to call the police in exchange for free ice cream.

TITLE: TIFU By drunkenly making out in someones bathroom

POST: So this literally just happened last night and I am typing whilst recovering on my sofa. I go to pretty intense Uni, UWO, both for work and for partying and last night I went to a friends house warming party. People were chilling music was bumping etc. Essentially I consumed 1/2 a bottle of Jack Daniels and 1/2 a bottle of tequila and somehow managed to chat up a girl, will call her J. One thing lead to another and we headed to the bathroom. As we were furiously making out and taking of our clothes, I somehow managed to slip and fall straight into the tub with her, which would have been fine, if not for the fact my head slammed against the soap holder in the tub.

The thing smashes into pieces and my head starts bleeding. A lot. My entire chest is covered in my own blood in a very short span of time. I can't feel much because of the alcohol and now J is kidda freaking out (understandably). She gets toilet paper and gets we to put pressure on the wound whilst she calls an ambulance. When we are leaving, the whole party is freaking out because they think the cops will show up. I essentially spend all night at the hospital, getting stitches whilst J (bless her) keeps me company. I ended up with 18 stitches on the side of my head. But I did get to stay at Js after I got released from hospital!

TL;DR: I got drunk, made out with a girl in the bathroom, fell and hit my head on a soap holder, got 18 stitches, and ended up staying at her place. I'm still trying to process what happened.

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and embarrassing tale of how they messed up their life in some way. In this case, the author got drunk, made out with a girl in a bathroom, fell and hit their head, and ended up with 18 stitches. The post is relatable, entertaining, and has a good dose of humor, making it a great fit for the r/tifu subreddit. The author's honesty and willingness to share their embarrassing story is also commendable, and the post has received a lot of engagement and comments from other users.

TITLE: USPS mysteriously sent me someone else's package - readdressed it to me [US]

POST: Mysterious situation. Sorry about the text wall. Located in the United States.

A few months ago, I bid on (and won) an auction for tools and other supplies on a popular online auction website. The package was mysteriously delayed during shipping at one of USPS's sort facilities due to what I assumed was the rather extreme inclement weather.

Once I received the package, I found a letter from the postal service INSIDE the box stating that due to a mishap at the facility there were packages that became dislodged during shipping. If any problems arose to send a letter to their complaint department. The package did not contain the tools but rather an incredibly large number of sealed DVD sets to a very popular TV show. 

I contacted the seller and he had no idea what I was talking about with DVDs. He stated that he sent only the items pictured in the auction. I have no reason to believe that he was being disingenuous because when you compare the price of both items on Amazon, the overall value of the DVD sets is much, much higher.

After some back and forth with the USPS I was able to reach someone who started an official search at the three USPS sort facilities in the region. After three months they terminated the search and stated that my item was not found. I also inquired what to do with the DVDs that I received. Initially they said to keep them sealed because if my original package was found, they may need me to send the DVDs back to the sort facility. But later they essentially told me on the phone that they didn't know what to do with the DVDs.

Months have gone by, and I decided to try and recoup my money so I've started selling them locally. I've only sold a handful, but I began to wonder what kind of legal ramifications I could run into? Also I became paranoid that the DVDs may contain some kind of elicit or illegal material so I unwrapped several of them and skimmed through them on my computer. I could not find anything out of the ordinary. They appear to simply be the entire DVD set of the TV series.

TL;DR: USPS sent me someone else's package (DVD sets) instead of my original package (tools). I've tried to resolve the issue with USPS, but they've essentially given up. I'm selling the DVDs locally, but I'm worried about legal repercussions. Should I be concerned?

---

**Legal Advice:**

The situation is quite unusual, and it's understandable that you're concerned about potential legal repercussions. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Possession of stolen goods:** You may be in possession of stolen goods, which could lead to legal issues if the original owner of the DVDs comes forward. However, since you've already started selling them, it's essential to be transparent about the situation and provide documentation to potential buyers.
2. **Copyright infringement:** Although you've skimmed through the DVDs and didn't find any explicit or illegal content, there's still a possibility that the TV show's copyright holders could claim that you're distributing their intellectual property without permission. This could lead to legal action.
3. **USPS's responsibility:** As the USPS was responsible for delivering the incorrect package, they may be liable for the mistake. You could try contacting them again to see if they're willing to take any further action or provide compensation for the inconvenience.
4. **Selling the DVDs:** Since you've already started selling the DVDs, it's crucial to be honest with potential buyers about the situation. You should provide a detailed description of the package, including the fact that it was sent to you in error by the USPS. This will help mitigate any potential legal issues.
5. **Consult a lawyer:** Given the complexity of the situation, it's recommended that you consult a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property law or consumer protection to get a better understanding of your legal obligations and potential risks.

Remember to prioritize transparency and honesty when dealing with the situation. It's also essential to keep detailed records of all correspondence and transactions related to the DVDs.

POST: For the past few months, this girl (Girl 1) I go to high school with has been flirting with me and things have been going pretty well. Recently, she told her best friend (Girl 2) that she likes me and how she wants to be with me etc. 

Well, it turns out Girl 2 started liking me a little while before she found out that Girl 1 and I have been flirting for the past few months. Being the good friend that she is, Girl 2 decided to keep quiet about liking me because she didn't want to ruin/get in between me and Girl 1. 

However, recently Girl 2 finally cracked about how she liked me and told Girl 1 everything. Now Girl 1 is acting distant because she doesn't want to ruin her friendship with Girl 2. But the thing is, Girl 2 is encouraging Girl 1 to not give up on this relationship because Girl 2 knows that Girl 1 really likes me.
 
At this point, both me and Girl 1 are avoiding each other and I'm trying my best to kill these feelings I have for her because I don't want to ruin their friendship. The thing thats killing me is that we both like each other and everything would be perfect if it wasn't for this one detail :(

Even Girl 2 wants us to be together and she is mad at herself for liking me and telling Girl 1 about it in the first place. 
I'm stuck in the middle of all this and I don't know if i should back off or if I should still have hope in this entire situation.

TL;DR: Girl 1 and I have been flirting for months, but her best friend Girl 2 also likes me. Girl 2 told Girl 1 about her feelings, and now Girl 1 is acting distant because she doesn't want to ruin her friendship. I'm torn between pursuing Girl 1 and respecting their friendship.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you gotta talk to Girl 1 and be honest with her. Tell her how you feel and see how she reacts. If she's still interested, then you can work through this together. If not, then you can move on and focus on building a connection with Girl 2."
* "I think you should take a step back and give Girl 1 some space. She's clearly conflicted about her feelings and her friendship with Girl 2. Let her figure out what she wants and then you can re-enter the picture. Don't want to be the one who ruins their friendship."
* "Girl 2 is a good friend for keeping quiet about her feelings, but now that the cat's out of the bag, you should talk to her too. See if she's willing to take a backseat and support you and Girl 1's relationship."
* "This is a tough spot, but I think you should prioritize your feelings and what you want. If you're still interested in Girl 1, then you should try to work through this with her. If not, then maybe it's time to explore the connection with Girl 2."
* "Have you considered talking to Girl 2 and asking her to give you some space? You don't want to be the one who's stuck in the middle of this drama, and Girl 2 might be willing to take a step back if you're honest with her."
* "I think you should take a break from both girls and focus on yourself for a bit. This is a lot to handle, and you don't want to make any rash decisions that you might regret later."

TITLE: I [24 M] broke up with my gf [22 F] of less than a month because of the trauma of being woken up by her seizures

POST: In the beginning of a wonderful relationship, I was woken up one morning by my (ex)girlfriend convulsing beside me. She had two "pre-seizures" and though I supported her completely I was mortified. It was a terrifying experience. I knew that she had had them some years back, but was not warned that this might happen.

The spark was gone - it permanently changed how I felt about her, despite my efforts to keep it alive.

The relationship had been awesome up until that point, and now I can't shake the feeling that either A: I'm an asshole and/or B: I screwed up what could have easily been the best relationship of my life to date.

TL;DR: Woke up to girlfriend's seizures, broke up with her, feel guilty and unsure if I made the right decision.

TITLE: I'm [21M] torn between where to go. Confused about 2 women, both [20F]. Been in a relationship with one for ~1.5 years.

POST: Hi all. So I've got quite a long story here, but I'll try and keep it as short as possible. 

So to begin, me and a woman I dated for 3 years broke up nearly 2 years ago. Contact was cut completely within 3 months, and I haven't spoken with her since. Around that time she began dating another guy. A while after this, I also began dating another woman. 

So me and this woman have dated for the past 1.5 years roughly, and things have definitely had more downs than ups. We have fought constantly, never seen eye to eye, and don't share any hobbies. 

My ex and I, on the other hand, completely got along, would have a few big fights here and there, and shared mostly the same hobbies. 

My current girlfriend and I have been on and off for the past few months, and right now we're in a hiatus. But, for the past few weeks, I've caught myself thinking about my ex more and more, and I'm not sure why. I hadn't thought about her in a long time, and lately I can't seem to get her out of my head. I legitimately miss her.

So through the grapevine, I've heard that my ex and her boyfriend aren't exactly doing the best, and things are falling apart. I want so badly to text her or something. But I just don't know if it's right. 

Can anybody give me advice here? I'm absolutely lost and confused right now. Thanks to anyone who can help!

TL;DR: I've been in a relationship with one woman for 1.5 years, but I've been thinking about my ex a lot lately. My ex and her boyfriend are having issues, and I'm torn between reaching out to her or staying with my current girlfriend.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're clearly still in love with your ex. Take some time to reflect on why you're thinking about her so much. Is it because you're unhappy with your current relationship or is it because you genuinely miss her? If it's the former, maybe you should work on improving your current relationship. If it's the latter, maybe you should consider reaching out to her and having a conversation about your feelings."
* "I think you're being unfair to your current girlfriend. You've been in a relationship with her for 1.5 years and you're still thinking about your ex? That's not fair to her. You need to make a decision and stick with it. If you're not happy with your current relationship, then maybe it's time to end it and focus on yourself for a bit."
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want. Do you want to be with your ex or do you want to work on your current relationship? You can't keep going back and forth between the two of them. You need to make a decision and stick with it. If you're not happy with either option, then maybe you should consider taking a break from relationships for a bit and focusing on yourself."
* "I think you're being a bit selfish here. You're thinking about your own feelings and desires, but you're not considering the feelings of your current girlfriend or your ex. You need to think about what's best for everyone involved. If you're not happy with your current relationship, then maybe it's time to end it and focus on yourself for a bit. But you also need to consider the feelings of your ex and her boyfriend. They're going through a tough time and they don't need you adding to their stress."

TITLE: This is my mom's amazing giant kitty Bart. (He was named by the shelter.)

POST: My mom adopted him in late 2009. He was sent back from the shelter TWICE, despite the fact that the shelter strongly warned the adopting families that Bart was a mature, independent cat who didn't do well with children and needed to be the only pet. Apparently, when he was returned, it was because he was "mean." My mom adopted him, let him do his own thing in the house, didn't get in his space at all, a month after she adopted him he jumped into her lap.

Now, he follows her from room to room. He's friendly and loving to both me and her, and loves sitting in our laps- which can be a problem, because he's a HUGE cat who weighs like 18lbs! He's a giant panther cat stalking around, but he's a sweetheart, and even acknowledges and accepts strangers now (if they offer attention)!

Point being, if you're going to adopt, PLEASE make sure you listen to the shelter about the temperment of the cat. Cats are wonderful, loyal, loving creatures, but they are NOT submissive, they are NOT dogs, you CAN NOT "train" them (past a certain point), they will not BEND to you. You can support them and take care of them and they WILL love you undyingly, they will follow you around, purr in your lap and constantly try to attack your feet from under the bed. Just acknowledge that they are little people with personalities. :) Bart is a CHARACTER for sure. :)

TL;DR: My mom adopted a giant, independent cat named Bart from a shelter. Despite being returned twice before, he's now a loving and loyal companion who follows her around the house. Moral of the story: listen to the shelter about a cat's temperament and remember that cats are individuals with their own personalities.

IMAGE: A photo of Bart, a large, fluffy cat with a gentle face, sitting on a couch with his head tilted to one side. He appears to be looking directly at the camera. In the background, there is a blurred image of a living room with a TV and a few pieces of furniture. The image is captioned "Bart, the giant kitty" with a heart symbol. The post includes a few additional photos of Bart in different settings, showcasing his size and personality. The images are all high-quality and well-lit, with a warm and inviting tone. The overall aesthetic is cozy and comforting, with a focus on showcasing Bart's unique personality and the special bond he shares with his owner.

TITLE: Help me plan our honeymoon, South America in summer?

POST: Hey /r/travel!

Me and the gf are getting married june 1st and are trying to plan the honeymoon. We have 8 weeks from end of june to middle of august to spend. Our plan is to spend 1-2 weeks home in Sweden and then go somewhere semi-adventurous for the remaining 6 weeks

Our initial plan was to go to South America, maybe start off in mexico and then finish off in peru or chile. From some reading from wikivoyage i got the feeling that most of SA has rain periods during summers.

My questions to you /r/travel are:

1. Will it rain a lot in central/northern america during july/august?
2. What would you recommend us seeing in these parts of the world? 
3. How far in advance do we need to book inca trail?

Our interests are mainly hiking/outdoors, adventures, sports and living some of the local cultures.

TL;DR: Planning our honeymoon in South America for 6 weeks, starting in mid-june. Will it rain a lot in central/northern America during july/august? What should we see? How far in advance do we need to book Inca Trail?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/traveler88**: Hey! As a fellow traveler, I'd say that July-August is actually a great time to visit Central and Northern America. The rainy season is usually during the spring and fall, so you should be good to go! Mexico, Peru, and Chile are all amazing destinations. For Mexico, you should definitely check out the Yucatan Peninsula, especially Tulum and Playa del Carmen. For Peru, the Inca Trail is a must-do, but you should also visit the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Chile is a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, with the Andes and Patagonia being must-see destinations.
2. **u/SouthAmericanAdventurer**: Ah, you're planning a South American adventure! I'd recommend starting in Mexico, then heading to Peru, and finishing off in Chile. The weather in July-August should be great, with warm temperatures and minimal rain. For Mexico, you should check out the ancient Mayan ruins, like Chichen Itza and Tulum. In Peru, the Inca Trail is a must-do, but you should also visit the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Chile is a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, with the Andes and Patagonia being must-see destinations.
3. **u/IncaTrailExpert**: Ah, the Inca Trail! You should definitely book it in advance, at least 6 months prior to your trip. It's a popular trek, and you don't want to miss out on this incredible experience. Make sure to book with a reputable tour operator, and be prepared for the physical challenge. The Inca Trail is a 4-day, 3-night trek that takes you to Machu Picchu, one of the most iconic sites in South America.
4. **u/SwedishTraveler**: Hey, fellow Swede! I've been to South America a few times, and I can recommend some amazing destinations. For Mexico, you should check out the Yucatan Peninsula, especially Tulum and Playa del Carmen. For Peru, the Inca Trail is a must-do, but you should also visit the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Chile is a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, with the Andes and Patagonia being must-see destinations. Don't forget to try some delicious local cuisine, like ceviche and empanadas!
5. **u/AdventureSeeker**: Ah, you're planning an adventure! I'd recommend starting in Mexico, then heading to Peru, and finishing off in Chile. The weather in July-August should be great, with warm temperatures and minimal rain. For Mexico, you should check out the ancient Mayan ruins, like Chichen Itza and Tulum. In Peru, the Inca Trail is a must-do, but you should also visit the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. Chile is a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, with the Andes and Patagonia being must-see destinations. Don't forget to try some adventure activities, like hiking, biking, or even surfing!

TITLE: How to be the peacemaker during mine [26/m] and gf's [26/f] terrible fights.

POST: I've been dating my gf for 11 months now and for a while I've been commuting 3.5 hours on 4 day weekends to stay at her place while I was in grad school.  Now that we spend all days together, we seem to bicker a lot.  In addition to the bickering, we'll have long 2+ hour arguments (at least once a week.  Sometimes 2 days in a row) that always, ALWAYS end with me thinking "this is fucking crazy" and just apologizing and eating my words and feelings to settle down the argument.  

In 11 months, I don't think once she's started the compromise/apology/or anything to end the argument.  She thinks I'm generally selfish and that I "paint her out to be a bitch."  And sometimes she'll straight up lecture me like I'm a child.  

It's really hard to always have to be the first one to say sorry.  And then take the blame for the whole argument.  

Sometimes she even throws stuff when she's really mad.  I'm also beginning to think she doesn't respect me at all.  

The worst part is - I'm TERRIFIED of being alone.  Before I met her, I had no real friends, no life, I spent way too much time on the computer.  With her, I can be engaged soon, be living with her in an apt, have a dog (her awesome dog), and cool friends (her really nice friends).  Without her, I'd live at my parents for a while, have very rare hangouts with very few friends, be lonely as hell.  She's a great package deal.  And the thing is, I really don't think I could do better than her at all.  She's beautiful, smart, and when we do get along, it's like a fairy tale.  We have a real strong connection and compatibility when we're getting along which is about 85% of the time.

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a wonderful girl, but we have terrible fights that always end with me apologizing and taking the blame.  I'm tired of being the peacemaker and want to find a way to resolve our conflicts without me always having to say sorry.  I'm scared of being alone and think she's a great package deal, but I don't know how to deal with her constant bickering and disrespect.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not alone in this. I've been in similar situations before. It sounds like your girlfriend has some serious issues with communication and conflict resolution. Have you tried talking to her about how you feel? Like, really talking to her? Not just apologizing and moving on. You need to have a real conversation about how you feel and what you need from her in these situations."
* "I think you're being too passive. You need to set some boundaries and stand up for yourself. It's okay to disagree and have different opinions. You don't have to always apologize and take the blame. Try saying 'I understand you're upset, but I don't think that's fair' or 'I feel disrespected when you talk to me like that'. You need to assert yourself and show her that you're not just going to roll over and take it."
* "I think you're being too focused on being alone. You're not going to find someone who's perfect, and relationships are work. You need to focus on building a healthy and respectful relationship with your girlfriend, rather than just trying to avoid being alone. Have you tried couples therapy? It might be helpful to work through some of these issues with a professional."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not selfish for wanting to be heard and respected in your relationship. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to stand up for yourself and assert your needs. Don't be afraid to be a little selfish and prioritize your own needs for once."
* "I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If your girlfriend is consistently disrespecting you and not willing to compromise or apologize, that's a major red flag. You deserve better than that. You need to think about what you want and need in a relationship and whether this is the right fit for you."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your comments! I really appreciate the advice and perspectives. I think I've been too focused on being alone and not enough on building a healthy relationship. I'm going to try to take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship and think about what I want and need. I'm also going to try to assert myself more and stand up for myself in our arguments. And I'm going to consider couples therapy to work through some of these issues. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: Our friend [22M] is an an abusive relationship with [21F]. What can we do?

POST: I am friends with a soft spoken guy - we'll call him Chad - in our social group (all friends from college) who is in an emotionally abusive relationship. His girlfriend Christina pushes him around, dictates his schedule, speaks on his behalf, and has no qualms with tearing him down in front of everyone. A few incidents have occurred over the past few months that have really made the fact that Christina is emotionally manipulative and abusive hit home. The only problem? Chad either doesn't see it, or he's too afraid to leave for fear that we will choose her over him.

My boyfriend and I want to help Chad, but we worry that Christina is keeping him from interacting with us. Our invitations to him to hang out have gone unanswered and he often seems nervous to speak with us when in a group setting. We've decided that the best course of action is to get him alone, to talk to him, and to tell him that *we are here*, we see what's going on, and we want to help. He won't be alone if he leaves Christina; he will still have us (at the very least) there as a support system.

Of course, if this goes badly (if Chad doesn't leave and Christina finds out what's happened), it will cause **massive** chaos in our friend group. We will probably be unceremoniously punted from our social circle. 

What should we do? My boyfriend and I have discussed this at length, and we genuinely feel that someone needs to reach out to him and let him know that he is not alone. Emotional abuse can be absolutely soul searing, and we want to offer him a life jacket if he needs one. At the same time, we realize that this may be the beginning of the end of our group of friends. How can we approach this delicately?

TL;DR: Friend in abusive relationship, we want to help but worried about consequences. What should we do?

TITLE: How do I become unstuck?

POST: So, I live at home and work at a job I'm not too crazy about. I've been applying to jobs I want for 2 years now, with 0 luck...I spend hours on my cover letter (even researching organization mission statements), I tailor my resume, I research the recruiter's name (but not always)...but everything feels like a dead-end. I think its because my current job is at the bottom of the totem pole and isn't related to what I want to do. I have 2 degrees and I've started a hobby website related to my career interests, but so far, still no luck.

TL;DR: I'm stuck in a dead-end job, can't get hired anywhere else, and feel like I'm wasting my life.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're focusing too much on the job itself and not enough on building connections and networking. Have you tried attending industry events, joining online communities related to your field, or reaching out to people in your desired field for informational interviews? Sometimes it's not about the job itself, but about who you know and who knows you."
2. **u/throwaway321**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's normal to not get hired right away, especially if you're changing fields. Have you considered taking some courses or getting certifications to boost your skills? Also, don't underestimate the power of a good old-fashioned LinkedIn connection. Reach out to people in your desired field and see if they'd be willing to chat with you about their experiences."
3. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you're stuck in a rut because you're not taking any risks. Have you considered taking a part-time job or freelancing in your desired field to get your foot in the door? Sometimes it's not about the job itself, but about taking small steps towards your goals. Also, don't be afraid to take a break and recharge. Sometimes we just need to step away and come back to our goals with fresh eyes."
4. **u/throwaway456**: "I think you're focusing too much on the job itself and not enough on your own personal growth. What are you doing to take care of yourself and prioritize your own happiness? Sometimes we get stuck because we're not taking care of our own needs. Have you considered taking up a new hobby, practicing self-care, or setting aside time for personal development?"

**Common themes:**

* The importance of networking and building connections
* The value of taking small steps towards one's goals
* The need to prioritize personal growth and self-care

TITLE: Past and present drug users/abusers/ and dealers, what are your craziest drug-related stories?

POST: An ex-friend of mine (let's call him rob) got hurt real bad a while back and was prescribed perc's for the pain. He wasn't into the idea of getting hooked on them so he barely took the pills. One day someone asked him for a free pill, and that's where the downfall began. Eventually and slowly Rob started to distribute the pills and began selling them. After seeing how fast the money came (over 20 grand in one month) he pretty much was the biggest perc connection in the area. 

At this point he was buying them illegally rather than getting them prescribed, so when his suppliers weren't able to meet the, he got about 20 grand together and flew to florida to get his pills. After finding a "reliable dealer" and testing some of the perc's, he was happy and bought them, then flew back. 

First deal back in my state, was a major one. Rob went to meet up with the buyer, and when they went to exchange the product, the pills... Were fake. All of them. In a single blow all his business was gone. 

Now this is where Robs luck truly runs out. Being a semi-small town where this was all happening, the cops caught wind after a few months. Rob had quit the dealing due to the fake pills, but barely a few days later, while Rob was at a fellow drug-dealers house waiting for pizza, things got suspicious. Their regular pizza guy wasn't the one deliviring, but it was a guy in his mid-40's. For some reason Rob opened the door, and immediatelywas bum rushed by 10 cops. 

Both Rob and his friend were placed under arrest. The cops found the 10000 fake percs, and looked like they hit the jackpot, thinking they were real. Fast-forward after court, percs were found as fake and all Rob got was a year in jail for possessing fake drugs.

TL;DR: Ex-friend Rob got into dealing perc's after being prescribed them, made a lot of money, but got caught after buying fake pills and got a year in jail.

TITLE: Sketchy job offer

POST: Long time lurker, first post ever. I'm looking for a bit of help trying to figure out if this potential job is legitimate. Regardless of my desperation, I'm typically rational when it comes to making big life decisions but last week, I received an email from a recruiter about a potential "Project Management" position from a VC from Delaware and all I had to do was apply on their website if I was interested. I was already sketched out but 2 things checked out: 1. Recruiter had a corporate email and 2. The website seemed really legit, so I thought that it wouldn't hurt to apply. There was no financial information requested, only my address and phone number as well as my references.

On Monday, I received another email, asking to schedule a phone interview. At this point, a lot of emotions take over and I request for a call at their soonest availability. The next day, I receive the call right on schedule by a female with a heavy Russian-ish accent. I was asked a couple basic questions like my typical workday and my career goals. It was very brief, 8-10 minutes but I immediately felt that I was being scammed. After the phone call I do even more research and found that the site has been active for only 21 days.

Today, I got an email about the next step from a Sr. in Human Resources. Attached was a contract for a one-month paid training which is apparently a part of their "screening process" before they decide to hire full time. Again no financial info was asked from me, just e-sign the document.

The document says that the corporate address is in Kowloon and I haven't been able to find ANY contacts on linkedin but they included a bunch of address for the new office in Los Angeles. I'm going to call all the numbers to see if I could speak with anyone. How should I go about all of this to find out if this is a real job and also a what is the best way to protect myself if it isn't?

TL;DR: Got a job offer from a recruiter for a "Project Management" position from a VC in Delaware. Applied, had a brief phone interview, and now they're asking me to sign a contract for a one-month paid training. The company seems sketchy and I'm worried about being scammed. How can I find out if this is a real job and what are some ways to protect myself?

**Comments:**

* "Don't sign anything! This is a classic scam. They're trying to get you to commit to something before you even know if it's a real job. Just block their emails and move on."
* "I'd recommend doing some more research on the company and the recruiter. See if you can find any reviews or testimonials from other people who have worked with them. Also, be wary of any company that asks you to sign a contract before you've even started working."
* "I'd say it's 99% likely that this is a scam. The fact that they're asking you to sign a contract before you've even started working, and the fact that they're using a fake address in Kowloon, are both major red flags. Don't risk your time and energy on this. Just move on and keep looking for a real job."
* "I'd suggest trying to contact the company directly and asking some tough questions. Ask them about their company culture, their values, and what kind of work you'll be doing. Also, ask them about the contract and what it entails. If they're being evasive or unclear, it's a good sign that something is off."
* "I'd recommend being cautious, but not dismissing it entirely. Sometimes companies can be a bit unconventional in their hiring process. If you're really interested in the job, you could try reaching out to the company directly and asking some questions. But be sure to do your research and don't sign anything until you're sure it's a real job."

TITLE: [Freshman Advice] Partying/Early Social Questions

POST: Hey everybody!

I'm going to preface this with the fact that I'm a great student, I'm on top of my studies, and I'm currently in the process of applying to clubs and getting involved with organizations around campus, that said:

My first two weeks of college has been, well, much more uneventful than I expected. I have been looking for opportunities to go party on the weekends (nothing too stupid I promise) but I can't seem to find anything. It feels like frats run the party scene at my school (UF), and the only way to have any fun on a Friday/Saturday night or tailgate is to be a part of one. Basically

TL;DR: Freshman looking for party opportunities on campus, but can't seem to find anything outside of frats. Help!

---

COMMENTS:

1. **u/UFAlum**: "Hey freshman! As an alum, I can tell you that frats do run the party scene at UF, but it's not the only way to have fun. Have you tried checking out the Greek life website to see if any frats are having events that are open to non-Greek students? Also, there are plenty of other organizations on campus that throw parties or have social events. You might want to check out the Student Government Association or the Campus Activities Board. They often have events that are open to the whole student body."
2. **u/PartyAnimal**: "Dude, you're at UF, you gotta be willing to take some risks and put yourself out there. I know it's scary, but trust me, it's worth it. Try hitting up some of the smaller parties or gatherings that aren't necessarily affiliated with frats. You can find those on social media or by asking around. And if all else fails, just show up to a frat party and see what happens. Just be respectful and don't get too wild, you know?"
3. **u/ResponsibleStudent**: "I'm glad you're prioritizing your studies, but don't forget to have some fun too! As a responsible student, I can tell you that there are plenty of ways to have a good time on campus without getting too wild. You might want to try checking out some of the cultural organizations or clubs that have events during the week. They're a great way to meet new people and have some fun without the pressure of partying. And hey, if you do decide to go to a party, just make sure to drink responsibly and look out for your friends."
4. **u/UFStudent**: "Hey freshman! I'm a current student at UF, and I can tell you that the party scene is definitely alive and well on campus. But it's not all about the frats, there are plenty of other ways to have fun. You might want to try checking out some of the smaller parties or gatherings that aren't necessarily affiliated with frats. And if you're looking for something a little more low-key, you could always try checking out some of the campus events or activities that are open to the whole student body. Just remember to always prioritize your safety and well-being, and don't be afraid to reach out if you need any help or advice."

TITLE: What is an appropriate and healthy way that I [31 M] can officially break up with my ex GF [30F] of 2 years.

POST: GF on and off for 2 years and I have had major issues with her flirting through texts and various forms of social media... Every time I confronted her about it she only hid it better or took it to a different social media platform.... Have broken up many times and got back together with the intent on her working on it... This last time I decided this is it, however we said we would take a month 'break' of no contact to see if we really wanted this, then meet up and talk about our plans.....

I don't want to meet up but she keeps insisting we do, seeing her would make my heart decide for me and I know I will end up with her again, or at the very least, sleep with her again... I know thats not healthy. I love this woman, deeply, if not for the lack of trust and her decision to continue the flirty behavior, I would more than likely marry her. I want her to really work on herself and grow and be happy with her life after this break. I want to break up formally with her but I'm not sure how to do so in a healthy way. She says she needs closure but I don't know what to say. I'm not going to see her face to face, I dont even want to talk on the phone. But I want to break up in a healthy contructive way where we both leave this better than when we came in.... 

Help?

TL;DR: 2 year on/off relationship, major issues with flirting through texts/social media. Want to break up formally, but don't want to meet up or talk on phone. Want to do it in a healthy way, but unsure how.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're being incredibly selfless by not wanting to meet up or talk on the phone. It's clear you care about her and don't want to hurt her, but you also need to prioritize your own well-being. Consider writing her a heartfelt letter or email explaining your feelings and reasons for the breakup. This way, she'll have closure and you can both move on without having to have a potentially painful conversation."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous commenter. Writing a letter or email is a great way to break the news. You can also include specific examples of the flirting behavior that bothered you and how it made you feel. This will help her understand your perspective and take responsibility for her actions. Remember to be kind and respectful, but also firm and clear about your decision."
3. **u/itsjustmeagain**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You've given her multiple chances to work on herself and she's not taken them. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You don't owe her closure or a face-to-face conversation. Just be honest and direct in your letter or email, and be prepared for her to be upset. But ultimately, you're doing what's best for you, and that's something to be proud of."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "I think you're doing the right thing by not wanting to meet up or talk on the phone. It's clear you're trying to avoid rekindling feelings or getting drawn back in. Instead, consider having a mutual friend or family member deliver the news to her. This way, she'll still get the message, but you won't have to be involved in the delivery. Just make sure to be clear and direct in your message, and be prepared for her to be upset."

**Key takeaways:**

* Writing a heartfelt letter or email can be a healthy way to break up with someone, providing closure and a clear explanation of your feelings and reasons for the breakup.
* Prioritize your own well-being and don't feel obligated to meet up or talk on the phone if it's not comfortable for you.
* Be kind and respectful, but also firm and clear about your decision.
* Consider having a mutual friend or family member deliver the news if you're not comfortable doing it yourself.
* Remember that you're doing what's best for you, and that's something to be proud of.

TITLE: I [M17] have dated this girl [F17] twice in this year and she dumped me twice, we are still friends, I realize I still liked her a lot, should I just ask her out again? Help

POST: We're both currently enrolled in high school. Me and her dated for several weeks during the end of the last year's school year. After summer break, school started and we had classes together and we both became friends again, eventually we got back together, but then she dumped me again only after a short period of time (less than a month) cause of something I did which was not serious at all. Semester one passed, we are still friends to this day. And I feel like I still really adore her and such. I'm just wondering whether I should just tell her that I like her again or should just forget her and start new relationship.

TL;DR: Dated girl twice, got dumped twice, still friends, still have feelings for her, should I ask her out again?

---

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like she's not interested in you romantically. You've already been rejected twice, and it's not like you're going to change her mind by asking her out again. You deserve better than someone who can't make up their mind or doesn't value your feelings. Start focusing on yourself and finding someone who genuinely cares about you."
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's possible that she's not ready for a relationship or that she's just not interested in you. Instead of asking her out again, try to focus on building a strong friendship with her. If she's still interested in you as a friend, that's okay. You can always keep the door open for a potential future relationship if things change. But don't put yourself in a situation where you're going to get hurt again."
* **u/skeptical_sam**: "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're still holding onto these feelings. Are you really sure you're ready for a relationship with this girl, or are you just holding onto the idea of being with her because it's familiar? You deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you and willing to work through issues together. Don't rush into anything, and focus on building a strong foundation for yourself before considering another relationship."
* **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think it's okay to ask her out again, but make sure you're prepared for the possibility that she might say no again. You've already been rejected twice, so it's not like you're going to get a different answer. But if you do decide to ask her out, make sure you're being genuine and not just trying to get her back because you're still hung up on her. Be honest with yourself and with her about your feelings, and see where it goes from there."

TITLE: This girl I'm seeing [26F] wants to stop seeing me bc of my financial situation. I'm [24M]

POST: So I've been seeing this girl for almost a month and we really like each other, but ever since I've been hanging out with her my credit card dept has increased by 1500 dollars....on top of that I also owe 10000 in dept to student loans + car payments. I want to get rid of this dept asap, this way I'll be able to build my capital. 

So when I told her that I want to cut down on my spending she said that it was a huge turn off for her and that what I said is a dealbreaker. 

So should I just let the two of us break up, while I'm still not fully emotionally attached to her, or should I find a compromise with her? Or should I allow us to break up without resistance because she couldn't understand that I need to work on my finances (knowing that this issue would cause problems in the long run)?

TL;DR: Girl I'm seeing wants to break up with me because of my financial situation. I want to get rid of my debt, but she thinks it's a dealbreaker. Should I just let us break up or try to find a compromise?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not willing to work with you on this issue. If you're not fully emotionally attached, it might be best to just let her go. You deserve someone who understands and supports your goals, even if it means making sacrifices."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your financial situation and your goals. Maybe she's not aware of the extent of your debt and how it's affecting you. It's possible she might be willing to work with you to find a compromise."
* "It's not about being 'emotionally attached' or not. It's about being honest with yourself about what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. If you're not willing to compromise on your financial goals, then maybe this relationship isn't meant to be."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so attached to getting rid of your debt. Is it really about building capital, or is it about feeling like you're in control of your finances? If it's the latter, then maybe you need to work on your own emotional attachment to your financial situation before you can have a healthy relationship with someone else."
* "I think you should just let her go. You deserve someone who understands and supports you, not someone who is turned off by your financial situation. You can't change who you are or your financial situation, so it's better to find someone who loves you for who you are."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are divided, with some people advising the OP to let the girl go and others suggesting that he should have an open and honest conversation with her about his financial situation and goals. Some commenters also suggest that the OP should take time to reflect on his own emotional attachment to his financial situation and whether it's truly a priority for him. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that he needs to think carefully about what he wants and what he's willing to compromise on.

TITLE: Dropped out of college as of a weeks ago, what can I do?

POST: *week

I was looking to major in Computer Science Engineering but couldn't even get through my statistics and Physics course.    I now have 33 credits and a C- average.  My college was one that was wellknown for it's engineering program.  I've made one SQL database in my entire life, and have only had novice experience in Java.  I am lost and don't know what I want to (and still can) pursue at this point.

I am feeling dejected and down.  The college was all I ever wanted, it gave me grant that paid for the tuition completely and most of room and board.  I am regretting and blaming myself for being unmotivated and didn't seek help until it was too late.  I know and it's all my fault.
I also cannot pay for college out of my own pocket.

Reddit, what can I do?

TL;DR: Dropped out of college after struggling with stats and physics, feeling dejected and lost. What can I do now?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Hey, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to realize that college isn't for you. You can always take a gap year, work, and figure out what you want to do. You can also look into online courses or vocational training to gain skills in a specific area. Remember, it's not the end of the world."
2. **u/tech_noob**: "I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I ended up taking a break from college and working as a software engineer. I realized that I didn't need a degree to be good at my job. You can always learn on your own and build a portfolio. Look into online resources like Udemy, Coursera, and FreeCodeCamp. You can also try to find a job as an intern or entry-level developer to gain experience."
3. **u/lost_in_space**: "I think you should take a step back and think about what you're really passionate about. What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Is it coding? Is it something else? You can always take a break from college and focus on building a career in that area. Remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out."
4. **u/college_student**: "I'm a college student myself, and I have to say that I'm a bit surprised that you dropped out. But hey, it's not the end of the world. You can always come back to college later if you decide you want to. In the meantime, you can try to gain some work experience and build a portfolio. Look into internships or part-time jobs in your desired field. You can also try to take online courses or attend workshops to gain skills."
5. **u/mentor**: "Hey, I'm a mentor for a coding bootcamp, and I've seen many people like you who have dropped out of college. It's not uncommon, and it's definitely not the end of the world. You can always take a break and focus on building a career in tech. Look into online resources like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and Udemy. You can also try to find a job as an intern or entry-level developer to gain experience. Remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out."

TITLE: TIFU by not paying attention to my Facebook messages

POST: I am currently deployed to Afghanistan, and the military life has been pretty hard on my marriage. I've been having a lot of my mind and you could almost say borderline depressed. There is a lot of stuff that I can't just tell my wife, especially over a social network site, but I don't lie to her. I tell her I have a lot on my mind and I will tell her all about it when I get home. I didn't think it meant anything beyond that. My job here is a desk job, and I get a phone call from my supervisor about the 15th rumor of when we are actually going home. So, I message my wife, "oh my jesus, I just don't care anymore!" What I then noticed is that she sent something just before that that went along the lines of, "I think I know what's been on your mind. I know we haven't had the best marriage due to your deployments but we've been through too much just to give up." Of course right after I see that, I attempted to correct myself. I typed 2 words and then, out of nowhere, power outage. Our internet went down for numerous hours and I think my wife thinks I really don't care about our marriage anymore. When it finally came back up, I got to send the message I meant to send and apologized. She hasn't messaged me back yet...

TL;DR: I'm deployed in Afghanistan, my marriage is struggling due to my deployments, and I TIFU by not paying attention to my Facebook messages and sending a message that made my wife think I don't care about our marriage anymore.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) is deployed in Afghanistan and is struggling with his marriage due to the deployments. He tries to be honest with his wife about his feelings, but ends up sending a message that makes her think he doesn't care about their marriage anymore. The OP realizes his mistake and tries to correct it, but the damage may already be done.

The post is relatable because it shows how easily a simple mistake can be made in the heat of the moment, and how it can have serious consequences. The OP's situation is also unique because of the challenges he faces as a deployed military personnel, and how it affects his marriage.

The post also highlights the importance of communication in relationships, and how a simple misunderstanding can lead to a lot of hurt and confusion. The OP's wife may have felt hurt and betrayed by his message, and it may take a lot of effort to repair their relationship.

Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story, and it shows how easily a simple mistake can be made in the heat of the moment. It also highlights the importance of communication and honesty in relationships.

TITLE: I [24M] told my roommate to move out by May, my girlfriend [29F] wanted by the end of February, and is now calling the relationship over.

POST: Long story. Ultimately, my girlfriend who I have been with for about 7 months now, has never liked my roommate and thinks he is the devil, full of darkness. I will grant her this, his drinking habits do bring in some darkness and have caused problems. I see this need for roommate shift, and me wanting to live alone (and eventually with her) as our lifestyle choices no longer matching up. To her, I choose my roommates wellness over hers. I gave a date I felt comfortable with since it is my grad school graduation month, which I decided going in I would want to live alone afterwards, but to her, I am a pussy and surrendered. I see it as me having a heart for a long time friend.

TL;DR: I told my roommate to move out by May, my girlfriend wanted him out by the end of February, and now she's calling the relationship over.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like your girlfriend is more concerned about her own feelings and needs being met than actually caring about your roommate's well-being. You're trying to find a compromise, but she's not willing to listen. Maybe it's time to reevaluate if this relationship is truly healthy for you."
* "I think you're being too soft on your roommate. If he's causing problems and affecting your girlfriend's quality of life, maybe it's time to take a stand and prioritize your relationship. You can't keep compromising on something that's affecting your partner's happiness."
* "I don't think it's fair to say that your girlfriend is more concerned about her own feelings than your roommate's well-being. It sounds like she's genuinely upset about the situation and feels like you're not taking her concerns seriously. Maybe you should try to have a more open and honest conversation about your feelings and priorities."
* "I think you're being too rigid with your girlfriend. She's not asking you to kick your roommate out immediately, just to have a plan in place for when you graduate. Maybe you could compromise and find a solution that works for both of you."
* "It sounds like your girlfriend is trying to control the situation and dictate what you do. You need to stand up for yourself and your roommate's rights. If she can't accept that, then maybe the relationship isn't meant to be."

TITLE: Me [19 M] may have some serious feelings for my hairdresser [21-23 F] I want to spend new years together and I need some serious advise!

POST: So currently I am 19 years old. I think she between 21-23, not married, and has been cutting my hair for a few months. She always gives me dollars off my next hair cut and hums ever so sweetly. She talks to me about making up our own stories and intrigues me ever so. I can't get her out of my head and as I was walking out I heard her say "no". As I left I got a burst of inspiration and wrote my name with my phone number. Rapping it in a dollar I told the other person to make sure she gets this. There is a small chance I may have wrote the wrong number down. Regardless, I want to call up the hair cutting place and ask if she is there. If she is, I can buy some hair jell and ask her out. Would this be wise? I need advise!
Still no call the next day...I really want to spend new years eve with her. Should I put forth more effort to contact her? I really hope that I can build a relationship and explore my sexual fantasies with this individual. She is all I can think about. Reddit, I really need advice to handle this situation. I am so lost.

TITLE: What's the most awkward or cringeworthy thing that's ever happened to you on a date?

POST: I'm 25M and I've been on a few dates recently, but one that stands out as particularly awkward was with a girl I met on a dating app. We went to a coffee shop and things seemed to be going well, but then she started telling me about her extensive collection of antique teapots. Like, she had a whole room in her house dedicated to them. I tried to be polite and ask her questions, but it was just getting weirder and weirder. Then, she pulls out a small, intricately carved teapot from her purse and starts pouring "tea" into a tiny cup. I was like, "Uh, is this a thing? Are we having tea now?" And she's like, "Oh, yes! I brought it for us to share!" I was mortified. We ended up leaving the coffee shop and going to get ice cream instead. Needless to say, that was the last date we went on.

TL;DR: 25M shares a cringeworthy date story about a girl who brought out a tiny teapot on a coffee date.

TITLE: AITAH for assuming my roommate's "friend" was just a hookup and telling her so?

POST: So my roommate has been seeing this guy, let's call him "Alex", for a few months now. She's always talking about how great he is and how much she loves him. But every time I see them together, they're always holding hands or cuddling, but never actually kissing or showing any real affection. And don't even get me started on the way they always seem to "accidentally" bump into each other in the living room. I'm like, "Girl, you're not fooling anyone with this 'friend' nonsense." So, the other day, I confronted her about it and told her that I think Alex is just a hookup and that she's fooling herself. She got really upset and said that I was being judgmental and that I didn't know the whole story. But honestly, I just think she's in denial. AITA for assuming the worst and telling her so?

TL;DR: 25F assumes her roommate's "friend" is just a hookup and tells her so, roommate gets upset. AITA?

I'm just trying to process my emotions and deal with what's going on. Why is it a bad thing to be sensitive? And why does she always have to make me feel like I'm being too much or too emotional? Can someone explain this to me like I'm five?

But then he starts telling me about how he's a "9 out of 10" and that he's looking for someone who's an "11 out of 10". I was like, "Dude, what are you even talking about? This is a grocery store, not a beauty pageant." And then he had the nerve to ask me out on a date. I was like, "Uh, no thanks, I'm not interested." And he's like, "Oh, okay, well maybe you're just not ready for someone as hot as me." I was like, "Dude, you're not even hot." Has anyone else ever had a guy say something this ridiculous to them?

TL;DR: 25F shares a story about a guy who told her she was a "10 out of 10" and asked her out on

TITLE: an old flame [27M] and I [21F] are considering a FWB situation, but I'm a little uneasy.

POST: brief background: met James earlier this year through OkCupid. we went on a phenomenal date, had great sex, and were both pretty into each other. James is bipolar and lives two hours away, and a few days after our great date, he told me that he didn't think he was stable enough for a relationship with that much distance (he's an artist so money is sporadic). I was pretty bummed, deleted him off of Facebook, and moved on.

fast forward to last week. I started dating someone after James and that relationship ended last week. by coincidence, a few days later James reached out to me to ask how I was and to say he'd been thinking about me. we decide we should hang out in the next few days and meet in the middle at a hotel (to spare the distance and because I needed to get out of my house). we get drunk, have sex, cuddle, have a great time, even spend the next day together going to a few shops.

now James and I are talking about striking up a FWB arrangement, but I guess I'm a little concerned. the emotions weren't there when we hung out last week but I think that has a lot to do with my relationship recently ending and I have a feeling that if we have sex regularly knowing that we already had strong feelings for each other at one point, it's going to turn into a relationship. I guess I just don't know if you can have one without the other in this situation.

any advice? anyone been in this situation and can share their experience? I wouldn't be opposed to a relationship with James way down the line and I think he knows that, but obviously with the distance and his instability, it's a little hard to gauge.

TL;DR: had a great date with an old flame, we had sex, and now we're considering a FWB arrangement. I'm a little uneasy because I think our strong feelings for each other could turn into a relationship if we keep having sex regularly. Has anyone been in this situation and can offer some advice?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, I think you're right to be uneasy. You and James have a history, and it's hard to separate the emotions from the physical aspect. If you're not ready for a relationship, it's okay to say no to the FWB arrangement. You can always keep the door open for a relationship in the future if things change."
* "I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's not easy. You need to have an open and honest conversation with James about your feelings and boundaries. Let him know that you're not looking for a relationship right now, but you're willing to keep the door open for the future. And if he's not okay with that, then it's probably best to just keep things platonic."
* "I think you're overthinking this. If you're both on the same page and you're both comfortable with the arrangement, then why not? It's not like you're getting married or anything. Just make sure you're both communicating and respecting each other's boundaries."
* "I would say that it's not worth it. You're putting yourself in a situation where you're going to get hurt again. You deserve better than that. You need to focus on yourself and your own happiness, and not get caught up in someone else's drama."
* "I think it's worth considering, but you need to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Are you doing it because you genuinely want to be with James, or are you doing it because you're lonely or bored? Make sure you're being honest with yourself and with James about your feelings and motivations."

Overall, the comments are mixed, with some people advising caution and others encouraging the OP to consider the FWB arrangement. The most common advice is to have an open and honest conversation with James about feelings and boundaries, and to make sure that both parties are on the same page. Some people also caution against getting caught up in someone else's drama and advise the OP to focus on their own happiness.

TITLE: My [30 F] colleague [28 F] is cherry-picking my responsibilities at work - what do I do?

POST: I've been working at my current company in the marketing department for 5 months, colleague in question has been there for one year. The company is a start up and only two years old. 

Recently, my colleague was given a lateral promotion of sorts: She's going from running our digital marketing to managing brand communications, as the former role wasn't really working out.  The head of our department (who hired me but didn't get along with her) resigned a few months ago. My colleague is temporarily being managed by the CEO, who told her to write her own job description.

Since this shift in her role a month ago, she's been suggesting to me and others that she now has some management authority over me and the work I do. It started with unwanted suggestions on how I should do my job and her cutting me off in meetings (she talks LOADS) but now is escalating to her trying to take elements that were originally in my job description for herself (i.e. blogger outreach) and delegating tasks to me. She's positioning herself as middle management but as far as I know no one has officially given her this authority.

It's clear to me that she has no direction in what she's supposed to be doing and is therefore trying to make herself look busy/important, but I'm finding it increasingly challenging to deal with her. Some of my colleagues have noticed this behaviour from her too and one said she's toxic to the business, so I'm trying not to take it personally.  However, the management team love her so I'm hesitant to say anything to my temporary manager. I realised today, though, that I am now miserable in a job I used to enjoy. What should I do? Should I try to talk to her or just bite the bullet and go to my manager?

TL;DR: Colleague is trying to take my responsibilities and act like she's my manager, but no one has officially given her that authority. What do I do?

TITLE: [17/m] Lost [16/f] contact info!

POST: Okay so i am asking, and i'm going to try to request advise in the most non-creepy way i can think of. Here goes nothing. So basically i am 17 and i went on a vacation with my family. While in branson i met the most amazing girl in my life. She looked stunning and we had everything in common i.e. we talked the entire day without really doing much else. I could tell we were an instant click so by the end o the day she gave me her phone number and she told me where she lived which, coincidentally, is about half an hour away from me. When we said our goodbye it felt like the da best eva especially considering i didn't know what would happen. The next day my phone crashes and by the time i get it fixed my parents changed the carrier company so my sim card got wiped. I started freaking out because i don't remember her last name or her phone number. The thing i have to go on is her first name her neighborhood what high school and what she looks like. Does anyone know how to i can find her? I already tried social networking but to no avail.

TL;DR: 17 year old lost contact info of 16 year old girl he met on vacation. He has her first name, neighborhood, high school, and a description of her appearance. He's tried social networking but can't find her.

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Don't stalk her**: Many users advised against trying to find her through social media or other means, as it could be seen as creepy or invasive. Instead, focus on finding a more legitimate way to get in touch with her.
* **Try to remember more details**: Users suggested that the OP try to remember any other details about their encounter, such as the specific location where they met, the time of day, or any conversations they had. This could help him narrow down his search.
* **Reach out to her high school**: Some users suggested contacting the girl's high school and asking if they have any information about her or how to get in touch with her. This could be a more official and less invasive way to try to find her.
* **Be patient and respectful**: Many users emphasized the importance of being patient and respectful in his search. It may take time and effort to find her, and it's important to prioritize her feelings and boundaries.

**ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:**

* "I'm a girl and I've been in a similar situation before. It's really important to prioritize her feelings and boundaries. Don't try to find her if she doesn't want to be found. It's not worth risking your relationship or her feelings."
* "Have you tried contacting her high school? They might have information about her or be able to help you get in touch with her."
* "I'm not saying this is the best idea, but if you're really serious about finding her, you could try reaching out to her neighbors or people who live in her neighborhood. Just be respectful and don't be pushy."

TITLE: Agreed to meetup Saturday but haven't heard from since

POST: Hello reddit..
I need some advice. I've been talking with this girl for about 2 weeks now. We went out last weekend and it went great. We were working on setting up another date and she told me that she was concerned about distance (its about a 30 minute drive). I messaged her back and said that i agree with her but there are ways around it. Anyways, after that she messaged me that sue would like to try and said that maybe we could set something up for Saturday (tomorrow) i replied that that sounded great and i was looking forward to it. I havent heard anything since (this was tuesday night). Ive texted her a couple of times just wishing her a good day at work (no more than once a day). I'm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to text her again but its now been about 5 texts since her last response. Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: Set up a meetup for Saturday, haven't heard from her since Tuesday night, and I'm unsure what to do.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'd say it's time to reach out again, but not too aggressively. Try sending a casual "Hey, just wanted to check in and make sure everything is okay. Looking forward to Saturday still" kind of message. If she doesn't respond, it might be a sign that she's not interested or something came up, but at least you'll know where you stand.

COMMENT 2:
I agree with the above comment. It's been a few days, so it's not like you're being too pushy. Just send a friendly reminder and see if she responds. If not, you can always try calling her or sending a different type of message (like a funny meme or something). Just don't come on too strong, you don't want to scare her off.

COMMENT 3:
I'd say take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. If she's not responding to your texts, it might be a sign that she's not interested in pursuing things further. You don't want to keep investing time and emotions into someone who's not reciprocating. Maybe it's time to move on and focus on someone who's more responsive and interested in getting to know you.

COMMENT 4:
I think you should try to get a better sense of what's going on with her before jumping to conclusions. Has she ever been flaky or unreliable in the past? Is there something going on in her life that might be causing her to be distant? Try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can get a better sense of what's going on. It's possible that there's a legitimate reason for her lack of response, and it's worth exploring before giving up on the relationship.

TITLE: Me [21 M] hanging out with a bunch of girls too much a bad thing?

POST: I came home after being away the last couple of years. During my time away I developed a lot of confidence particularly around girls. I have been getting a decent amount of attention from girls who I feel are expressing interest, and I have dated some of them, whilst being friendly and texting others. 

I'm currently single and I wouldn't mind having a girlfriend but I'm just kind of going with the flow right now. Basically, I see a lot of potentials but I'm not really worried about making any moves, however I can sense signals. I'm just worried about making friends with too many girls and fear that I may be leading some on while I'm just happy being friends. I find myself hanging out with a lot of girls, I just enjoy their company more than guys. Is it bad to have too many friends that are girls? 

I am not trying to brag. I'm just a little concerned as to where this may be heading. Does reddit have any ideas/thoughts/ways to handle this?

TL;DR: I'm a 21-year-old guy who's been away for a couple of years and has developed confidence around girls. I'm currently single and enjoying the attention, but I'm worried about making friends with too many girls and potentially leading some on. Is it bad to have too many friends that are girls?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not bad to have a lot of female friends. It's great that you're comfortable around them and enjoy their company. Just make sure you're not leading anyone on or giving them false hope. Be honest with them about your intentions and boundaries. If someone is interested in you romantically, it's okay to tell them you're just friends or that you're not interested. Communication is key."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's not about the number of female friends you have, it's about how you treat them. If you're being respectful, kind, and genuine with all of them, then you're not doing anything wrong. Just remember that some girls might have feelings for you, so be mindful of that. If you're not interested in dating someone, it's okay to tell them and be honest about it."
3. **u/just_a_guy_here**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and enjoy the company of the people you're hanging out with. If someone is interested in you romantically, they'll let you know. If not, then you can just keep the friendship going. Don't worry too much about it, and focus on building genuine connections with the people you're around."
4. **u/another_guy_here**: "I've been in similar situations before, and I can tell you that it's not about the number of female friends you have, it's about how you handle the situation. Just be honest with yourself and with the people you're hanging out with. If you're not interested in dating someone, it's okay to tell them and be honest about it. Don't lead anyone on or give them false hope."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Also, don't forget to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed about the situation, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate things. Remember that your feelings and well-being are important too."

TITLE: Me [24/M] and my closest friend [20/F] of 1 1/2 years - she doesn't want a relationship (with anyone, just not me) but has feelings for me.

POST: Her and i got into a fight a few months ago and we both told each other we have feelings for each other, so naturally I asked her out. She told me she doesn't want one even though she has strong feelings for me. Whenever her and I get really close to each other she pulls away and we fight. this is a continuous cycle. I finally asked her why she does it and she told me it's because she doesn't want to get hurt again. she wants to be friends but is too scared to date again.

   I do like her but just being friends is also torturing me. I want to prove to her that some people can be trusted. She said she doesn't want to lose me but I just don't know what to do. I told her i needed to be alone for a while to think of my next move. I don't want to lose her either but just being friends isn't enough.

   Maybe I'm being childish but its killing me inside that she won't even though she flat at told me she does. Should i give her some space? Maybe I need to move on. I just don't know.

TL;DR: Me and my closest friend have feelings for each other but she doesn't want a relationship. We keep fighting and pulling away from each other. I want to prove to her that some people can be trusted but she's too scared to date again. I'm torn between giving her space and moving on.

RESPONSES:

* OP, it sounds like you're stuck in a really tough situation. It's understandable that you're torn between giving her space and moving on. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? It might help her understand that you're not just looking for a quick fix, but that you genuinely care about her and want to be with her.
* I think you should give her space. It's clear that she's not ready for a relationship, and pushing her to be with you could lead to more hurt and frustration for both of you. Instead, focus on building a strong friendship with her, and see if that's something she's willing to work towards. Remember that you can't force someone to feel a certain way, and it's okay if she's not ready to take things to the next level.
* OP, I think you're being a bit too focused on proving to her that you're trustworthy. Instead of trying to convince her that you're a good partner, maybe try to understand why she's hesitant to date again. What is it about relationships that scares her? Is it a past experience, or is it something else entirely? By understanding her fears and concerns, you might be able to help her feel more comfortable opening up to the idea of dating again.
* OP, I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so invested in being with her. Is it because you genuinely care about her, or is it because you're scared of losing her as a friend? Be honest with yourself, and see if there's anything you can do to work on your own feelings and boundaries. Remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether or not you're in a relationship with her.
* OP, I think you should try to have a conversation with her about what she's looking for in a relationship. Ask her what her non-negotiables are, and what she's looking for in a partner. This might help you understand where she's coming from, and whether or not you're compatible. Remember that it's okay if you're not compatible, and it's better to know sooner rather than later.
* OP, I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. Whether or not you're in a relationship with her, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled. Try to find things that bring you joy and fulfillment, and see if that helps you move forward. Remember that you can't control how others feel or behave, but you can control how you respond to the situation. Take care of yourself, and see what happens.

TITLE: foreman won't talk to me

POST: Hey so I started this job two years ago. I am thinking of going elsewhere. I just wanted to confirm with you guys that I'm making a good choice.

When I started there, there was a co worker who started 4 months before who would berate me and yell at me and my foreman would go around telling everyone that this co worker was the best and best worker they have ever seen.
I went and told my boss about the verbal abuse and harassment after a month this co worker quit.

For the next 8 months this foreman than would glare at me and tell me to work harder and tell me I wasn't a good worker, among other things.
I did tell him to treat me fairly and that hey this isn't right.

So things settled for a while. Now for the last three months. He doesn't even talk to me at all anymore. He will talk through our work lead to talk to me.
I have tried talking to him but all i get is one word answers

I take it he's either just hates me or is intimidated to talk to me cause I stand up for myself.

I have been looking for a new job and might have a new one in two months. But it does eat me up a bit that it has gotten to this point and oh yeah he is nice to everyone (just wish he would grow up and talk to me about the problems he's having in his head with me)

TL;DR: Foreman won't talk to me after I stood up for myself against verbal abuse and harassment. I'm thinking of leaving the job.

TITLE: Long distance BF of 3 years (18M) doesn't seem that excited to see me (18F)

POST: My long-distance boyfriend is home for the weekend but he doesn't seem that excited to see me. I met him on his way back from the coach station yesterday evening, after I'd been at college and work. I just wanted to hug him and kiss him straight away, but he kind of just ignored that / didn't reciprocate. Example: I pulled him towards me and kissed him when we were walking up my street, just because I haven't kissed him for 3 weeks and I wanted to. It wasn't forced or anything, but then he kept saying we should stop because we're in the middle of the street (it was 10:30pm, no one else around) and we should'save it for later' (I'm at college/work 'later').He also said the same thing, and that I was getting 'carried away', when we were kissing after he walked me home. Isn't that a good thing?

He is pretty shy and does tend to internalise a lot, but we're very close and open with each other. 

We've only been apart 3 weeks this time but found it more difficult than other times. It was all 'I miss you' texts, but now he's home... I don't know. 

I don't know if I've just got unrealistic expectations of what his reaction'should' be. I kind of want him to jump on me and hug me and kiss me. I guess I just didn't feel that wanted. BUT I don't know if I'm just over romanticising / idealising the situation. 

Note: we've been together 3 years and have been long distance for 4 months.

TL;DR: Long distance boyfriend of 3 years doesn't seem that excited to see me after 3 weeks apart. I want him to show more affection, but maybe I'm just over romanticising?

This post is an example of a common issue in long-distance relationships: the lack of physical intimacy and affection. The OP (original poster) is feeling unappreciated and unloved because her boyfriend doesn't seem to be as excited to see her as she is to see him. She's feeling a bit frustrated and unsure of what to do.

The comments on this post are a mix of advice and personal experiences. Some people suggest that the OP should talk to her boyfriend about how she's feeling and express her needs and desires. Others recommend that she try to focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and not get too caught up in the lack of physical intimacy.

One commenter mentions that it's possible that the boyfriend is feeling anxious or stressed about being home and being with his girlfriend, and that this could be affecting his behavior. Another commenter suggests that the OP try to initiate more intimate moments and see how her boyfriend responds.

Overall, the comments on this post are a mix of advice, empathy, and personal experiences. The OP is seeking support and guidance on how to navigate this situation and improve her relationship with her boyfriend.

TITLE: Me [29:M] recently broke up with my gf [28:F] and now I don't know if I'm regretting it or just missing her...

POST: Here's the post about our breakup a few weeks ago - 

Now I find myself thinking about her more and more each day. I know there were parts that weren't great, because I can read that post. However, we've had a little bit of contact here and there, but nothing about the breakup. Just chit chat things about finding a place to live and stuff. We're still friends on Facebook and Twitter and she *seems* like she's doing all right, but maybe she's just doing that to make me feel less guilty...? I don't know.

I guess I'm just not sure what it is I'm feeling. I thought I'd be able to just move on and be fine because I was never really emotionally invested. Am I just bothered because she *seems* all right or do I really care more than I think I do? I want to send her an email (yes, an email of all things) and tell her what I'm going through and that maybe I'd like to hang out some time soon. I'm just afraid of building her hope (and mine?) up and then letting us both down if that feeling isn't there again...I'm not sure what i want to do here and I just don't know exactly what it is I'm going through. 

Should I send her an email? Should I try and get together with her and see if something is there? Should I even try? Or should I just delete her from social media and invoke a strict NC? Any advice would be decent.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, now I'm thinking about her more and more, not sure if I'm regretting it or just missing her. Should I reach out to her and try to rekindle something or just move on?

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in the context of breakups, where the person who initiated the breakup may start to feel regret or uncertainty about their decision. In this case, the OP (original poster) is unsure whether they are genuinely regretting the breakup or just missing their ex.

The post is seeking advice from the community on whether they should reach out to their ex and try to rekindle something, or if they should just move on. The OP is aware that they may be feeling guilty and is concerned about potentially building their ex's hope up only to let them down again.

The post is a good example of the complexities of human emotions and relationships, and how even after a breakup, people may continue to have feelings for their ex. The community's response to this post will likely be a mix of advice, support, and cautionary tales from others who have gone through similar experiences.

TITLE: TIFU by fishing down my top for money to pay for cigarettes.

POST: My mother and I recently passed an enjoyable week in Spain. On our last evening there, she remembered that my father had asked her to buy him some tobacco, as it's cheaper there than at home. So we wandered along the city streets of Madrid until we found a tobacco shop. I waited outside, then after a while she beckoned me in. She was twenty euros short, and remembered that she had given me 50 euros for emergencies. Which I had placed in my passport-carrier around my waist, under my clothes. While in airports getting out my passport simply involved lifting up my top slightly to remove my passport, on this evening I had chosen to wear a dress. Given that reaching under my dress to the purse would involve flashing my underwear to a shop of Spaniards, I decided that the most decent option was to plunge my hand down the top my dress, rummage for a while finding the zip on the passport holder, extracting the note and closing the zip, then to slowly remove my hand holding the 50 euro note without accidentally pulling up the dress. This attracted a fair few stares, and I was thankful to leave shortly afterwards.

TL;DR: I had to fish down my top in a Spanish tobacco shop to get 50 euros to pay for my dad's cigarettes, and it attracted some awkward stares.

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, which is a common theme on the r/tifu subreddit. The author shares a humorous and relatable story about a situation where they made a mistake or did something embarrassing.

In this case, the author's mother asks them to help pay for their father's tobacco, and they have to retrieve the money from their passport holder, which is located under their dress. The author decides to fish down their top to get the money, which attracts some awkward stares from the people in the shop.

The post is relatable because many people can imagine themselves in a similar situation, and the author's honesty and self-deprecation make the story entertaining and easy to laugh at. The use of vivid details, such as the description of the dress and the shop, also helps to make the story more engaging and memorable.

Overall, this post is a great example of the type of content that is often shared on the r/tifu subreddit, and it's a great way for people to share their own embarrassing or humorous stories and connect with others who have had similar experiences.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my GF [20F] for 4 years, she wants to explore the outside world but I still love her so much

POST: My girlfriend who has been with me for 4 years since we were 16 started showing signs of lost interest, her texts are short and short and simple despite me sending long texts and she sometimes find me clingy and annoying although I didn't do anything different from the past 4 years. I txted her my feelings and she said we should give each other some time and space, and that she doesnt want to commit to anything for her life because we're only 20 and she wants to explore since we're both each other's first.

I still love her a lot and we agreed to just give each other a week but I cannot resist myself from sending her our memories or wanting to talk to her. My heart stings really bad because she was a big big part of my life for a long time and now my life feels meaningless when I go to work or school. 

I feel horrible every minute especially when I wake up and when I'm at home alone, what should I do about this? Should I wait at her house or txt her today ( its been 3 days )? I feel so helpless, lonely and sad and all I want is her..

TL;DR: 20M, 4-year relationship with 20F, she wants to explore the outside world, I still love her, feeling lost, lonely, and sad, unsure what to do.

* "It's normal to feel this way, but you need to respect her boundaries and give her the space she's asking for. Try to focus on yourself and your own personal growth during this time. It's okay to be sad, but don't make it a habit. You can always reach out to her in the future if you both decide to rekindle things." (u/throwaway123456)
* "I think you're being a bit clingy and it's understandable that she wants some space. Maybe try to focus on your own interests and hobbies during this time. You can always talk to her in the future if you both decide to rekindle things. Remember, it's okay to take a break from each other and focus on yourself." (u/username123)
* "I think you should wait a bit longer before reaching out to her. Give her the space she's asking for and focus on yourself during this time. You can always talk to her in the future if you both decide to rekindle things. Remember, it's okay to take a break from each other and focus on yourself." (u/throwaway789)
* "I think you're being a bit too attached and it's understandable that she wants some space. Maybe try to focus on your own interests and hobbies during this time. You can always talk to her in the future if you both decide to rekindle things. Remember, it's okay to take a break from each other and focus on yourself." (u/username456)
* "I think you should try to talk to her and see where she's at. Maybe she's just going through a phase and will come back to you. But if she's really serious about exploring the outside world, you might need to accept that it's over. Remember, it's okay to take a break from each other and focus on yourself." (u/throwaway012)

**Conclusion:**

The OP is struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness, and helplessness after his girlfriend of 4 years told him she wants to explore the outside world and needs space.

TITLE: (19m) I have some unresolved issues and it is plaguing my relationship with my (18f) girlfriend...

POST: So, I don't usually post this kind of stuff but I honestly don't know who to turn to for help. Since I was 14 I have had a crush on my best friend (well... more than a crush) and she has had the same feelings for me. However, we were both too scared to make the first move and entered a bit of a stalemate for four years before she got asked out by some guy and I tried to move on. I started dating my girlfriend shortly afterwards and it lasted about 8 months, then things fell on the rocks on account of an acquaintance of ours and she dumped me. We are giving it a second go but things are still really shaky and one of the biggest problems is the situation with my aforementioned best friend... We still have strong feelings for each other and almost every night after she's had a few and I'm honestly too exhausted to give a damn (pretending not to have feelings is hard ok?) we always turn to talking about how things could have been and how we each wanted the other to make the first move. My girlfriend has started to notice the tension and fully expects me to dump her though I have no intention of doing so... Also I should mention that one of my exes came out of the woodwork, falsely accused me of sleeping with and impregnating her and told my current girlfriend who now has no faith in me at all. Her parents also hate me due to the original scandal with the mutual acquaintance and for some reason, she is blaming herself for all of this and wants me to dump her while also not wanting me to dump her... CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME? Thank you in advance...

TL;DR: I have unresolved feelings for my best friend, my girlfriend has started to notice the tension, and my ex came out of the woodwork and accused me of sleeping with and impregnating her, causing my girlfriend to lose faith in me. I don't know what to do.

ANALYSIS:

This post is a classic example of a complex and emotionally charged situation that requires a nuanced and empathetic approach. The OP is struggling with unresolved feelings for his best friend, which is causing tension in his current relationship with his girlfriend. The situation is further complicated by the false accusations from his ex and the lack of faith his girlfriend has in him.

The OP is seeking advice on how to navigate this situation and salvage his relationship with his girlfriend. He is aware that his girlfriend has started to notice the tension and expects him to dump her, but he has no intention of doing so. He is also aware that his girlfriend's parents hate him due to the original scandal and that she is blaming herself for all of this.

The OP's post is a cry for help, and he is seeking guidance on how to move forward in a way that is honest and respectful to all parties involved. He is willing to work on his relationship with his girlfriend, but he also needs to find a way to resolve his feelings for his best friend and deal with the fallout from his ex's accusations.

SUGGESTIONS:

1. The OP should have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and the situation. He should be honest about his unresolved feelings for his best friend and the tension it is causing in their relationship. He should also reassure her that he has no intention of dumping her and that he is committed to working through their issues together.
2. The OP should also have a conversation with his best friend about his feelings and the situation. He should be honest about his unresolved feelings and the impact it is having on his relationship with his girlfriend. He should also reassure her that he values their friendship and wants to find a way to move forward that is respectful to both of them.
3. The OP should consider seeking counseling or therapy to work through his feelings and the situation. A professional can help him navigate the complex emotions and provide guidance on how to move forward in a healthy and respectful way.
4. The OP should also consider taking steps to address the false accusations from his ex. He should seek legal advice and take steps to clear his name and restore his reputation.

Overall, the OP's situation is complex and emotionally charged, and it will require a nuanced and empathetic approach to resolve. With open and honest communication, a willingness to work through issues, and a commitment to finding a healthy and respectful solution, the OP can navigate this difficult situation and move forward in a positive way.

TITLE: Hit a wall, or fell off a cliff, during my marathon training

POST: I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?

TL;DR: I was running 8 miles at 80 minutes, but after a two-week trip, I can't run more than 2 miles without losing steam. I've tried to troubleshoot and have a few guesses, but I'm worried and hoping someone can help me figure out what's going on.

**Comments:**

1. **u/runningcoach**: "Hey OP, it sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of burnout. You've been running consistently for a few months, and your body is telling you it needs a break. I'd recommend taking a week or two off from running and focusing on active recovery. This can include light stretching, yoga, or even just taking a walk. When you come back to running, start with shorter distances and gradually increase your mileage. Don't worry, it's normal to hit a wall like this, and it's not a sign of anything serious."
2. **u/fitnessenthusiast**: "I had a similar experience after a big change in my diet. I went from eating mostly carbs to a more balanced diet, and it took my body a while to adjust. I'd recommend keeping a food diary to track your eating habits and see if there's a pattern. Also, have you considered getting your body fat percentage checked? Sometimes, a small change in body composition can affect your running performance."
3. **u/ultrarunner**: "I think you're overthinking this, OP. Sometimes, our bodies just need a break. I've had weeks where I couldn't run more than 2 miles, and it turned out to be nothing more than a minor setback. Just take it easy, and don't worry about it. You'll get back to your normal running self in no time."
4. **u/trainingforafull**: "I had a similar experience after a big change in my training schedule. I went from running 3 times a week to 5 times a week, and my body just couldn't handle it. I'd recommend taking a closer look at your training schedule and making sure you're not overdoing it. Also, have you considered getting a running coach or joining a running group? Sometimes, having a structured training plan and accountability can help you stay motivated and on track."
5. **u/runningnewbie**: "I'm not a running expert, but I had a similar experience after a big change in my environment. I moved to a new city and had to adjust to a new climate and elevation. It took me a few weeks to get used to it, but eventually, I adjusted and my running performance improved. Maybe you're just adjusting to a new environment or routine? Try to be patient and give your body time to adapt."

**Key Takeaways:**

* Burnout is a common experience for runners, especially after a period of consistent training.

---

TITLE: I've [23 M] started dating a lovely woman [23 F], what does she mean?

POST: OK, so I've started to date (4 dates so far) this woman who is really nice. We met at a college extra curricular lecture and things have been going swimmingly. My issue is me I believe, and I really could do with some advice.

So I'm really inexperienced with women and I'm pretty much flying by the seat of my pants right now and just trying to keep my head above the water so I'm doing my best to try and not scare this woman away. In my quest to do this, I've realised that I haven't really initialised any physical contact and it has all come from her. So for instance, at the end of the second date she gave me a peck on the cheek as way of saying good night. After the fourth date, I was still scared of offending her by holding her hand and putting my arm around her (I not a smooth man!) and she ended to date by just gunning for it and sucking my face off (totally not complaining!). Anyway, I decided to text her that I really like her and that the reason I haven't made a move yet is because I wasn't sure she'd appreciate it. She text back saying that she's not looking to rush into anything and moving slowly is maybe the way to go but she really enjoyed the evening as is looking forward to our next date. What does she mean by this?

TL;DR: I'm a 23 year old guy who's really inexperienced with women and I'm trying to figure out what my girlfriend means by saying she's not looking to rush into anything and moving slowly is maybe the way to go.

---

TITLE: Tricked into monogamy

POST: 26, f here. I started having sex with this 31 year old guy I know through friends, thinking he was casual about relationships. 1.5 years later I suddenly find myself hearing about how I'm spending too much time with other guys and he doesn't feel like I'm that into him. I do try to make him feel loved, but I thought we agreed from the start that this isn't what we want.

We both want this relationship, but disagree on the terms. I don't want to be exclusive, but I want him. Why is it that the one who wants the exclusivity always seems to be more in a position to make demands, even when otherwise was specified from the start? The advice I get is "Leave, you want different things" or "If you like him he should be enough". Why is the jealous one assumed to be the one who'd have the hardest time giving the other person what they need? 

And yes, we have talked. He won't have it and he's making me feel like the one that's breaking us up. 

I'm not talking about fucking lots of guys, even kissing is off the table.

TL;DR: Tricked into monogamy, want to stay with him but can't give up my freedom. He wants exclusivity, but we agreed on casual. Why is it always the jealous one who gets to make demands?

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not 'tricked' into monogamy, you're in a relationship and relationships involve compromise. If you want to stay with him, you need to be willing to compromise on your desire for freedom. It's not fair to expect him to be okay with you sleeping with other guys and then get upset when he doesn't want to be exclusive."
* "I think you're being unfair to him. He's willing to be in a relationship with you, but you're not willing to meet him halfway. If you want to keep him, you need to be willing to give up some of your freedom."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but you need to consider how your actions are affecting him. He's feeling insecure and jealous because he cares about you and wants to be with you. If you're not willing to meet him halfway, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship."
* "I think you're being too focused on your own desires and not considering his feelings. You need to think about what you want and what he wants and try to find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm not saying it's easy, but you need to decide what's more important to you: your freedom or your relationship with him. If you want to keep him, you need to be willing to make some sacrifices."
* "I think you're being too rigid in your expectations. Relationships are about compromise and communication. If you're not willing to listen to his concerns and work together to find a solution, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship."
* "I understand where you're coming from, but you need to consider the impact your actions are having on him. He's feeling hurt and betrayed because he thought you were on the same page. If you're not willing to work on your communication and trust, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship."
* "I think you're being too focused on your own desires and not considering his feelings. You need to think about what you want and what he wants and try to find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm not saying it's easy, but you need to decide what's more important to you: your freedom or your relationship with him. If you want to keep him, you need to be willing to make some sacrifices."
* "I think you're being too rigid in your expectations. Relationships are about compromise and communication. If you're not willing to listen to his concerns and work together to find a solution, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship." (Note: This comment is a repeat of a previous comment)

**Reddit's take:**

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly in favor of the guy wanting exclusivity, with many users suggesting that the OP needs to compromise on her desire for freedom in order to keep the relationship. Some users also suggest that the OP is being unfair to the guy, who is willing to be in a relationship with her but is not getting the commitment he wants. A few users suggest that the OP needs to think about what she wants and what the guy wants and try to find a compromise that works for both of them. Overall, the tone of the comments is that relationships require compromise and that the OP needs to be willing to make some sacrifices in order to keep the relationship. There is no mention of the guy's potential emotional manipulation or gaslighting, and the comments do not consider the possibility that the guy may be using his jealousy to control the OP. The comments also do not consider the possibility that the OP may be feeling trapped or suffocated by the guy's demands for exclusivity. Overall, the comments on this post are overwhelmingly in favor of the guy and do not provide a balanced perspective on the situation.

TITLE: (18/M) Don't know if I should pursue her(17/F), some opinions would be nice.

POST: So I just want to clarify that no I'm not a anti-social guy who is being friendzoned by a girl who is out of my league.

So I'm taking a friend of mine who is super pretty to my matric dance(prom) and I started becoming more interested in her after I asked her to go with me on a date. So I asked her and we are planning to go on a date after I finish writing my exams and before the dance(prom), and she seemed keen when I asked her so I guess that's something to go on. Also at the beginning of the year my one friend tried to set the both of us up to go out and from what he told me she was interested in me but it never happened because we just weren't comfortable with each other then and it was difficult to speak to her at first.

Now the problems start with the fact that I'm moving next year to another city 12 hours away from where we live to go to varsity. Now I stay committed when I get into relationships but long distance would be tough on me and I'm not sure about her. I brought it up with her before I asked her out that I'm going to be leaving and she seemed pretty disappointed by it.

The second problem for me is that this year was also the first time I've been in love with someone and the first time a girl rejected me when I asked her out - this is a long complicated story I don't wanna explain XD. Anyway some days she would pop up in my mind and I would get bummed out about it and also somebody in my grade is bringing her to the dance so that kinda sucks a little. After I stopped speaking to this girl that I fell in love with the girl I'm taking to the dance seemed to become a little bit more interested in me and started talking to me more often.

TL;DR: I'm taking a girl to my matric dance, we're going on a date before the dance, but I'm worried about the fact that I'm moving away next year and I'm not sure if she's ready for a long distance relationship. Also, I've never been in love before and I'm not sure how to handle my feelings.

**OPINIONS FROM THE SUBREDDIT:**

**u/throwaway123456**: Dude, you're 18 and she's 17. That's a big age gap. I'm not saying it's impossible, but you should consider the potential consequences. Also, have you talked to her about your feelings and what you're looking for in a relationship?

**u/relationshipgoals**: I think you're being too focused on the logistics of the situation. You're going to be apart for a year, but that doesn't mean you can't make it work. If you're both committed to each other, you can make it through the distance. Just make sure you're on the same page about what you want from the relationship.

**u/skeptical_sam**: I'm not sure if you're ready for a relationship, especially with someone who's still in high school. You're going to be in a new city, starting varsity, and dealing with all the stress that comes with it. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want before getting into something serious.

**u/romantic_at_heart**: I think you're being too practical. Love is about taking risks and being willing to work through the tough times. If you're feeling something real with this girl, don't let fear or uncertainty hold you back. Just be honest with her about your feelings and what you're looking for, and see where it takes you.

**u/cynical_sarah**: I'm not going to sugarcoat it, dude. You're 18, she's 17, and you're moving away. It's not going to work out. You're going to end up hurting her, or worse, she's going to end up hurting you. Just be honest with her and tell her you're not interested in pursuing anything further. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to lead her on and then break her heart.

TITLE: My (22M) girlfriend (20F) of one year can't be alone and I am afraid it will drive us apart.

POST: I wanna preface this by saying I have two different questions,  but they both seem to stem from the same issue. 

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly a year now and the relationship has been great. We're both pretty different people,  but we have been able to work out whatever issues have come up except for this one; she cannot be alone and I feel like a dick when I need alone time. 

I spend nearly every waking moment with her and while I love the time we spend together,  I need some time to focus on myself and do some things I enjoy, like video games, that she doesn't want to be a part of. I rarely get any such time because she needs someone to be with her. 
She has some pretty severe depression and while shes on medication for it, there are times that it only helps so much. There have been nights where she has talked about killing herself or starting drugs and I rush to her. When its normal and I leave, she is sad, but tells me its okay. I feel like a dick for taking time for myself and worry because I want her to be okay. I don't know how to convey that I need space for myself without making her think I don't want to spend time with her.      

This leads me to my second problem; I'm leaving for law school in about six months and im very worried about leaving her alone and being unable to be there for her. 

I have tried to bring it up before,  but she threw it back to me and said I was calling her crazy and that I wanted to break up with her. I'm just very scared of her doing something serious to herself when I can't be there for her and I don't want any resentment to come from this. I told her she needs to work on this, but her reasoning is that shes going to be okay the next day so it's okay, I disagree though. She has admitted that she can't be alone which frustrates me even more that she won't try to get help. I don't want to do a long distance relationship only for her to tell me that she needs someone around.

TL;DR: Girlfriend can't be alone and I need alone time, but I'm worried about leaving her alone for law school and her depression. How do I convey my needs without making her feel like I don't care about her?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're being incredibly understanding and empathetic towards your girlfriend's struggles with depression. It's great that you're willing to support her, but you also need to prioritize your own well-being. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your needs and boundaries. Let her know that you love and care about her, but you also need time for yourself to recharge. You can say something like, 'Hey, I know you struggle with being alone, but I need some time for myself too. Can we find ways to compromise and make sure you're okay when I'm not around?'"
2. **u/depressedanon**: "I'm a bit surprised that your girlfriend's depression isn't being managed better. It's great that she's on medication, but it's clear that she needs more support. Have you considered couples therapy? A professional can help you both work through these issues and develop strategies for managing her depression. Additionally, it might be helpful to encourage her to seek out support groups or individual therapy to help her cope with her depression."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being too focused on your girlfriend's needs and not enough on your own. You need to prioritize your own well-being and make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of the relationship. It's okay to say no to things that drain your energy and say yes to things that bring you joy. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure you're taking care of yourself first."
4. **u/sadgirl88**: "I'm so sorry to hear that your girlfriend is struggling with depression. It's not easy to deal with, and it's great that you're being supportive. However, it's also important to remember that you can't fix her depression. You can be a supportive partner, but ultimately, she needs to take responsibility for her own mental health. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and boundaries, and encourage her to seek professional help."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful comments. I really appreciate your perspectives. I think I need to have a more open and honest conversation with my girlfriend about my needs and boundaries. I don't want to make her feel like I'm abandoning her, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being. I'll definitely look into couples therapy and encourage her to seek out individual therapy as well. Thanks again for your advice and support."

TITLE: Having relationship problema because of too much sex

POST: Its kinda odd that our relationship has been starting to hit rocky shores because of this topic but it seems very reasonable. My girlfriend and I (both 17) are starting to have relationship problems, as we are starting to fight more, get in more arguments and just frankly not get along too well. 

We've been dating for more than a year and our sex life has been better than excellent. But it's starting to come to the point now that she feels that all I am interested in half the time is just having sex since it is all we do. Whenever were at each others houses we always have sex like its a given as to what we would do that day. She thinks that it's starting to take a toll on our relationship as we can't do anything but have sex like hangout without it. Obviously I love her so very much and don't want our relationship to end but it seems its very close to the finish. 

I really want to change our ways because I do believe half of it is my fault because of how horny I am. (trust me she is also very horny too) I don't know why but it always seems I get too heated in the moment and want to rip my clothes off and have sex with her but I really need to control that now since she sees the negatives of only having sex. we both go to school at the moment so we don't spend that much time together other than school so when we do see each other we are going to have sex. what should I do if I want to try and fix my relationship as its too based on the sex we have? (ofc its not the ONLY thing we do but it is a good portion) I love her and I really want to fix things as I understand how she feels and how she thinks our relationship is too based on sex. Would love to hear some of your guyss opinions and stories.

TL;DR: 17 year old me and my girlfriend are having relationship problems because we're having too much sex. I love her but I'm too horny and it's affecting our relationship. I want to fix things and make our relationship more balanced. What can I do?

TITLE: TIFU by letting 13 year old girls play with my DJ set before my show.

POST: So I was playing a bar mitzvah, it was actually my first DJ gig as an official DJ, I'd played house parties and stuff but this was my first time getting paid. Anyway, for all the parties I used a pair of computer speakers, Alesis Elevate 3s if you must know, but this was a bigger venue so I decided to use a different setup. 

I used my big huge Klipsch kt-lcr speakers but I couldn't find an amplifier, so I used my AM/FM stereo, a fairly nice one from the 90's, I'd been DJing with this setup in my bedroom for a while and everything worked fine if you kept the bass down a little. 

I got to the party a little bit too early and I was still setting up. The bar mitzvah kid's twin comes up with one of her friends and asks if they can play with my set. It's all setup so I thought "Eh, what could possibly go wrong" I delve under the mess of wires and cords to setup a few lights when I smell a plasticy smell and start to see smoke.

The noise starts to spontaneously weird out, the bass cutting in and out, until it just stops altogether. Anyway I come out from under the set and look at my board, the girls had cranked the bass and were scratching. I couldn't really tell about the bass, the speakers were pretty bassy and they were scratching. I shooed them off and thought maybe they were messing with the high-pass. I cue up another song and I hear a groan from my setup and then smell more smoke. I finally see it.

My FM/AM receiver is in flames. I immediately unplug it and start waving away the smoke, the fire has already started to go out. I wait a couple minutes for it to cool then try to play something else, but the lights on the stereo won't even come on. I had to play the rest of the show through the bar mitzvah's crappy bass amp.

TL;DR: I let 13 year old girls play with my DJ set before my show and they managed to set my FM/AM receiver on fire. I had to play the rest of the show through the bar mitzvah's crappy bass amp.

TITLE: I need some advice!!

POST: I wanna start off with a back story. I've been overweight for as long as I can remember... I really first noticed it when I was about 9-10 years old at that point I tried to become more active but shortly lost it when my dad got a new job. Around that same time I had also expressed to my mom that I felt food was the only friend I had and was the only friend that could move with us. Fast forward to when I was a freshman in HS I became increasingly more active because I didn't have a bus to take me to school and back. At this point my mom decided to put the family on weight watchers and we got a gym membership.  I went from being 230 lbs to being 175! I felt awesome but still had a bit more to go! I kept most of that weight off for a year until my mom stopped trying anymore and started making and buying crap foods. 
I'm now 22 years, 5'11", and a whopping 250 lbs. I'm done with it! I want to lose the weight! I envision myself about 100 lbs smaller! My biggest road blocks at this point, my husband doesn't need to lose weight, healthy food is expensive, and I have a slipped vertebra and bulging disc in my lower back.. exercising too much causes excruciating pain. 

Basically I need advice.  What should I do, how should I do it, is there anything that's helped jumpstart your weight lose endeavours? I know I just need to do it, but how?  How can I just do something when it feels like all odds are stacked against me...?

TL;DR: I'm 22, 250 lbs, and I'm done with being overweight. I want to lose 100 lbs, but I have roadblocks like an expensive diet, a husband who doesn't need to lose weight, and a slipped vertebra that makes exercising painful. I need advice on how to get started and overcome my obstacles.

TITLE: [19F] I have a gross girly crush on a co-worker [21M] but I don't know whether to give up or pursue

POST: Throwaway because my manager is a redditor.

I started work at a college job a few months ago, first started off because I needed money, but now I really love it and I would hate to leave my job. My shifts are timetabled around availability and lectures so sometimes I won't see some of the people on my team for weeks at a time. Worked my first shift with one of my coworkers a couple months ago and my first reaction was that he is totally my type but I should just get over it because I should be professional. Work a couple more shifts with him and we talk during the breaks about our interests, and he'd always greet me with a smile and ask me about my day. He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.

Then I fucked up and caught feelings. 

Here's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work.

TL;DR: I have a crush on a coworker who I haven't seen in months and I don't know whether to pursue it or not.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not weird to have feelings for someone, even if you haven't seen them in a while. The question is, do you think he feels the same way? Have you talked to him about anything outside of work? If not, it might be worth having a casual conversation to see if there's any mutual interest."
2. **relationship_advice_bot**: "It's great that you're considering the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with a coworker. Before making a move, ask yourself: 1) Are you prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way? 2) Are you willing to risk making things awkward at work if things don't work out? 3) Have you considered talking to HR or a supervisor about your feelings and getting their advice on how to handle the situation?"
3. **skeptical_sally**: "I'm not sure I'd pursue it, OP. You've had months to think about it and haven't even had a chance to talk to him outside of work. It's possible that he doesn't even remember you as more than a coworker. Plus, he's graduating soon, so it's not like you'd have a long-term relationship. Maybe just focus on your job and move on?"
4. **romantic_rick**: "OP, don't be afraid to take a chance! If you're genuinely interested in this guy, it's worth pursuing. Just be respectful of his time and boundaries, and make sure you're not putting him in an uncomfortable position. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and see where things go. Good luck!"
5. **practical_pam**: "OP, I think you should focus on building a connection with him outside of work first. Have you tried reaching out to him on social media or inviting him to a non-work-related event? If you can establish a friendship or mutual interest outside of work, it might make it easier to navigate a romantic relationship. Just be cautious not to blur the lines between work and personal life."

TITLE: I (21m) seeking advices with (21f) i've been seeing/dating.

POST: so i (21m)'ve been seeing this girl (21f), we went on couple dates and its pretty clear that we like each other, the problem is that after our lunch date today, she drove us back to her college, and about to go to a show with her friend, i was gonna meet up with my mate from the same college, anyway, of the all the recent times we caught up, we either end it with kisses or at least hug, but nope she didnt do either today, the scenario was us two and her friend, i thought she was in a rush so didn't worry about it coz i was planning to see her again after i caught up with my mate. i asked her when does the show finish, she told me its 3hrs ish, i told her i might still be around, told her to text me when it finishes. time forward 3hrs(we actually studied in the 3hrs time), didnt get a reply from her, so i started leaving her college, on the way out, of course she is on her way back, this time with our common friend (20f), so we(3 of us) chatted for a bit(like normal friend convo for couple minutes) it was getting weird, so i was like ok im gonna go now, i was expecting she'd come give me a hug or something but nope again, she's acting like we are normal friends and still havent heard from her....

so what do you guys think? we actually never discussed what we are, but i know for sure she's not that type of girl who wants a fling, she wants something serious. now i think about it, when there are people around us who know her, she wouldn't hold my hand or anything intimate, only when we are alone, she'd let me hold her hands and make out.

TL;DR: I've been dating this girl for a few dates, we've had some intimate moments, but today she didn't give me a hug or kiss after our date, and when I saw her again later with our common friend, she acted like we're just friends. I'm confused about what's going on and what she wants.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, it sounds like she's not ready to label things or make things official. She's still getting to know you and herself. Don't take it personally, just chill and see how things go. If you're feeling unsure, have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see where it takes you."
2. **u/datingadviceguru**: "I think you're overthinking this. She's just not feeling the need to be all lovey-dovey in public. Maybe she's not used to being in a relationship or maybe she's just not that demonstrative. Don't read too much into it. Just focus on having fun and getting to know her better. If she's interested in you, she'll make it clear in her own way."
3. **u/relationshipcoach**: "I think you're right to be confused. It sounds like she's sending mixed signals. If you're feeling unsure, I would suggest having a conversation with her about your feelings and what you're looking for in a relationship. Be honest and open, and see how she responds. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
4. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not buying it. She's not interested in you and is just using you for a good time. Don't waste your time trying to figure out what she wants. Move on and find someone who actually wants to be with you."

**Conclusion:** The top comments suggest that the OP is overthinking the situation and that she may not be ready to label things or make things official. They advise the OP to have an open and honest conversation with her about his feelings and to focus on having fun and getting to know her better. Some comments also suggest that she may be sending mixed signals and that the OP should be cautious and not invest too much emotional energy into the relationship. Overall, the comments provide a range of perspectives and advice, but ultimately, the OP needs to decide what he wants and how he feels about the situation.

TITLE: Friend (M/19) talking to girl that hit on me (M/19) previously. Do I tell him?

POST: So I am extremely good friends with one of my bros. I used to work at a low paying job and I knew this girl who also worked there. She texted me multiple times and it was kind of weird. She seemed a little bit like a slut but I'm not one to judge. I was 100% not interested in her but she kept texting. It never went anywhere just so you guys know.

However, my friend went out on a date tonight and I found out that it's the same girl! I know if she ever hangs out with our "friend group" she will recognize me and it will be weird. Should I tell him that the girl tried to hit on me? Do I sweep it under the carpet and not tell him? I personally don't think it's a big deal but it could get weird if they become more serious. I want the best for my friend and I don't want him to have his heart broken by a girl who is a slut and doesn't want the best for him

TL;DR: Friend went on a date with girl who hit on me previously. Should I tell him?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma that many people face in their personal relationships. The OP (original poster) is torn between whether to tell his friend about the girl's previous advances towards him or to keep it to himself.

The OP is concerned about the potential consequences of telling his friend, including the possibility of ruining the friend's date or causing tension in their friendship. On the other hand, he is also worried about the potential consequences of not telling his friend, including the possibility of his friend getting hurt or being taken advantage of.

The post has sparked a lively discussion in the r/relationships subreddit, with many users weighing in on whether the OP should tell his friend or not. Some users argue that honesty is always the best policy, while others suggest that the OP should keep the information to himself in order to avoid causing unnecessary drama.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to tell his friend or not is up to the OP, and it will depend on his own personal values and priorities. However, the post has highlighted the importance of communication and honesty in relationships, and the need to consider the potential consequences of our actions before making a decision.

TITLE: Playing tug-of-war with kids over stuff they're not supposed to be playing with... what do?

POST: I don't have a ton of experience babysitting, but I'm about to become an au pair and I want to work out a couple kinks.

How do you deal with kids who won't give you something they're not supposed to have when you ask for it? For example, I'm babysitting my little cousins tonight and I had to yank the remote control out of a 20-month-old's hands. I asked her for the remote (her brother was watching the TV or I wouldn't have cared) and tried to take it from her gently, but I ended up having to yank it away from her with more force than I would have liked to use with someone so little. The resulting tantrum was epic. I didn't like grabbing something from her somewhat harshly and was wondering if there's a better way to go about getting them to drop something they won't return. Or am I just being a sissy?

Thanks!

TL;DR: How do you deal with kids who won't give you something they're not supposed to have when you ask for it? I yanked a remote control away from a 20-month-old and got an epic tantrum. Is there a better way to do this?

---

COMMENTS:

* "Oh girl, you're not being a sissy! You're being a responsible adult. Those tantrums are normal and it's not your fault. Just remember to stay calm, patient, and consistent. When they get upset, acknowledge their feelings and offer a hug. Sometimes, they just need to feel heard. And hey, you're not alone - I've had my fair share of tug-of-war battles with my own kids"
* "I'm a pediatrician and I can tell you that 20-month-olds are still learning boundaries and can get really attached to objects. It's not uncommon for them to get upset when something is taken away. Try using a gentle but firm tone and say something like 'We don't play with the remote control, let's find something else to play with.' Sometimes, they just need a little redirection. And if they still get upset, try giving them a toy or a book to distract them"
* "I'm an au pair and I've had my fair share of battles with kids over toys. My approach is to try to distract them with something else they like, and then gradually phase out the toy they're attached to. For example, if they're playing with a toy car, I'll say 'Oh, look! There's a ball! Let's play with the ball instead.' And then, when they're engaged with the ball, I'll quietly take the toy car away. It's all about setting boundaries and being consistent"
* "I'm a mom and I can attest that it's not just about the toy itself, but about the control and power it gives them. When you take something away, it's like you're taking away their sense of control. Try to acknowledge their feelings and offer alternatives, like 'I know you really like playing with the remote control, but it's not safe for you to play with it right now. Let's find something else that's safe and fun.' And then, offer them a choice, like 'Do you want to play with the blocks or the dolls?' It's all about giving them a sense of control and agency"

This post and its comments demonstrate the importance of setting boundaries and being consistent when dealing with children. The original poster is concerned about yanking the remote control away from the 20-month-old and is seeking advice on how to handle similar situations in the future. The comments offer a range of perspectives and strategies for dealing with children who refuse to give up something they're not supposed to have.

Some common themes that emerge from the comments include:

* Acknowledging the child's feelings and offering empathy
* Setting clear boundaries and being consistent
* Using gentle but firm tone and language
* Offering alternatives and choices to give the child a sense of control and agency
* Redirecting the child's attention to a different activity or toy
* Phasing out the toy or object gradually to minimize resistance

These strategies can be helpful for parents, caregivers, and au pairs who are dealing with children who refuse to give up something they're not supposed to have. By being patient, consistent, and empathetic, it's possible to set boundaries and establish a sense of control and authority without resorting to force or tantrums.

TITLE: I (M/23) have serious troubles (on my part) communicating and relating to my mother.

POST: I have never really been able to talk to my mom easily. My parents divorced when I was about 3, and I have always been a bit of a troublesome and angry kid (and now adult). She is way more extroverted than I am and talks far more than I do. She has always been understanding, helpful, and supportive of whatever I do (despite being quite controlling of my life), but for some fucked up reason I resent her. Whenever her and I are alone I feel agitated, frustrated, and annoyed, so I just can't have a proper conversation without getting sarcastic and snippy, and shooting down what she says.

I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me, and it has been eating me up for my whole life and I don't know how to fix it. It feels like there is a mental block in my mind that prevents me from having a positive relationship with her, and I feel like I need some sort of therapy to fix it. She has been nothing but tolerant of me my entire life, despite me being a shithead most of the time.

The thing is I want to be able to relate to her, and I know that's all she wants, but my mind will absolutely not let me do it. Whenever I'm by myself I hate myself for being such a bad son. Has anybody had any experience with this, or have any advice about it? Thanks.

I'm fully aware of how much of a bad son this makes me, but I can't change it.

TL;DR: I have trouble communicating and relating to my mother due to my own issues, and I'm looking for advice on how to overcome this.

RESPONSES:

* OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's not uncommon for people to have trouble communicating with their parents, especially if there's a lot of baggage from the past. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you work through some of the underlying issues and develop healthier communication habits.
* I think it's great that you're acknowledging your own role in the problem and wanting to make a change. That's a huge step! Have you tried setting some boundaries with your mom? Sometimes people can get too caught up in trying to please others and forget to prioritize their own needs. Maybe setting some boundaries can help you feel more in control and less resentful.
* OP, I think you're selling yourself short. You're not a "bad son" just because you have trouble communicating with your mom. It's okay to have flaws and imperfections, and it's okay to need help working through them. I think it's really brave of you to be acknowledging this and seeking help. Keep in mind that your mom loves you and wants to have a good relationship with you, even if you don't always see eye-to-eye.
* OP, I think you might be putting too much pressure on yourself to "fix" this problem. Sometimes relationships are complicated and messy, and it's okay if they don't always go smoothly. Maybe instead of focusing on fixing everything, you could try to focus on being present and open with your mom? Sometimes just showing up and being willing to listen can be a huge step forward.
* OP, I think you're doing a great job of acknowledging your own flaws and imperfections. That takes a lot of courage! Have you considered journaling or writing about your feelings and experiences with your mom? Sometimes putting your thoughts and emotions down on paper can help you process and work through them. You might also consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about what you're going through. Sometimes just sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can be really helpful. Keep in mind that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.

TITLE: TIFU by falling asleep in my bros bed

POST: Alright, so this happened two days ago, on saturday afternoon. To set the scene, I go to a pretty large school in the south and the weekends pretty consist of drinking a lot and socializing. I got to the house where a few of my bros live at around 4 and to kill the time we decided to through a movie on and chill until it was time to start drinking and go out. HBO recently started carrying Bulletproof Monk so we throw that on. Turns out its fucking awful. I end up falling asleep on the end of his bed laying ~~horizontally~~ like a dog.

     Falling asleep was the beginning of my fuck up. I briefly remember a nightmare of being chased by some hellacious creature, I turn back to look at it while running, but cannot find it. I look forward. BANG I hit something.

     So I come to stumbling up the stairs of my bud's house with a massive headache, not knowing what the fuck has happened to me. I  rub my head (much to my chagrin it feels like its been beaten worse Denver in the super bowl last year) and find my hand covered in blood. I basically fall into the living room where all my friends are drinking and ask what the hell is going on and what happened. I simply can't talk and am concussed as fuck. I walk into the bathroom to find a major gash at the top of my head and blood all down my face. The next thirty minutes is comprised of me being in complete shock, not knowing where I am, and wondering what happened to me. I finally gather myself and start cutting up with my friends. This is when the guy who's room I fell asleep in walks through the front door holding a golf club... Not pointing fingers, but seriously, i'm suspicious now. 

**TIFU** by falling asleep on a bed doggy style, having my best friend hit me in the head with his golf club and being majorly concussed.

TL;DR: Fell asleep on my bro's bed, had a nightmare, hit my head, and woke up with a massive headache and a golf club-wielding friend.

**Edit:** I just wanted to add that I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a permanent scar from this incident. I'm also going to have to have a serious talk with my bro about his golf club.

TITLE: I'[M21] worried and she's [19] confused

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been going together for a little over one month and things have begun to get a little hot and heavy. Passionate make out sessions, heavy petting, etc. Now as things got pretty intense I see the definite signs of arousal, erect nipples, heavy breathing, dilated pupils, and she seems to be getting a little wet under her jeans.

 We break from anything more serious because time has become a factor but we just talk about what we enjoyed i learn some things about what turned her on but then she drops that she has considered herself asexual, but based on what both of us have seen that night she's in an interesting place.

To me she was clearly aroused and might have proceeded further, and she's not too sure what happened either as it's not how things usually are for her. I'm giving her time to think about everything and don't plan on pressuring her one way or another. I care about her enough to be fine with her if she feels like having sex with me or not. I just want other peoples input to assuage my worries, I'm just a worrying person.

TL;DR: Girlfriend who's 19 and considered herself asexual, but showed signs of arousal during intimate moments. I'm worried about her feelings and want to know if I'm overreacting.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I think you're being super understanding and caring. It's great that you're giving her space to think about everything. It's not uncommon for people to experience arousal even if they identify as asexual, and it doesn't necessarily mean she's changed her orientation. It's possible she's just exploring her sexuality or experiencing a temporary shift. Just be patient and have open conversations with her about how she's feeling. Remember that everyone's sexuality is complex and can evolve over time.

COMMENT 2:
I'm asexual myself, and I can attest that it's not uncommon for us to experience arousal, especially in situations where we feel comfortable and connected with someone. It doesn't necessarily mean we're "turning" or that our orientation has changed. It's possible that your girlfriend is just experiencing a moment of sexual attraction, which is different from sexual orientation. I think you're being really understanding and supportive, and it's great that you're giving her space to think about everything. Just remember to respect her boundaries and decisions, regardless of what she chooses.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being way too worried about this. It's not uncommon for people to experience arousal, even if they don't identify as sexual. It's possible that your girlfriend is just exploring her sexuality or experiencing a temporary shift. Just be patient and have open conversations with her about how she's feeling. Remember that everyone's sexuality is complex and can evolve over time. And honestly, if she's not ready to have sex, that's okay. You can still have a fulfilling relationship without sex.

TITLE: Can we have a "Post Your Dress" thread?

POST: Hello /r/weddingplanning!

I am very new to this sub and I am obsessed! I'm not engaged yet myself but SO and I have talked a lot about it and it is in our near future for sure :) ANYWAYS. I'm specifically fascinated by all the wedding dress photos that people have been posting. One thing that I find myself constantly wondering as someone who will be shopping for one is 'WOW, how much does that beautiful thing cost??' **So I'm wondering if y'all would be ever so kind as to post photos of you wearing your dress as well as including the following info: dress name, cost, place of purchase, size?, and any other info you'd like to include regarding the dress.** I think this will be great to see all the posts in one place (and feed my new wedding planning obsession) :)

I realize that there are already subs dedicated to wedding dresses but they are so small. So I'm posting here in the hopes that we can get many people posting their dresses and then we can all gush over them in one place. 

And a side note on future individual dress posts:
Is anyone interested in making a'requirement' that dress posts include'stats' in the post title? Similar to how /r/progresspics requires body stats so we understand the context. This would include things that I mentioned above like dress name, price, place of purchase, etc. Can even include dress size for more context (unless poster is uncomfortable sharing that info). What do you think?

TL;DR: Can we have a "Post Your Dress" thread where people share photos of their wedding dresses along with stats like dress name, cost, place of purchase, size, and any other info they'd like to share? Would love to see all the posts in one place and get inspiration for my own dress shopping adventure!

TITLE: Why don't self posts get karma?

POST: I understand that they used to and that people [complained] because there were lots of "vote up if" type posts that were getting karma. Removing karma from them, however, does not appear to have changed things. They've always been reported and deleted (none are on in the pages [archived by archive.org] for the time before it was removed). They still show up from time to time (despite it actually saying right above where I'm typing this "*Beginning your title with "vote up if" is violation of intergalactic law.*"), then they get reported and removed.

However, one effect that this has influenced is the creation of rage comics and an increase in screenshots. I've even noticed that increase just over the last year. Now, I'm not saying that they wouldn't happen if self posts got karma, nor that they are always inappropriate, but it is evident that there are some things that would be better as self posts that are instead posted as screen shots or rage comics and it's hard to not think that the lack of karma for self posts plays a part in this.

So, I think we should revisit this decision. It seems to me that self posts add original content to reddit and should be encouraged. This very, and very popular, subreddit is a perfect example. It accepts nothing *but* self posts. [IAmA] is another perfect example of a popular subreddit that is affected by this that is also quite popular. So, is there any reason we shouldn't start letting self posts get karma? If there is not, what kind of karma would be the most appropriate for them?

TL;DR: Self posts used to get karma, but were removed due to abuse. However, they still show up and are reported/deleted. I think they should be allowed to get karma again, as they add original content to the site. What do you think?

TITLE: TIFU By not checking the showtimes online

POST: Little backstory: I live in Malaysia, work in Brunei (Google it if you don't know where these countries are)

So I watched Deadpool last week during the holidays with my friends and it was freaking awesome. Now that my holiday is over and I'm back at my work place, I've decided to watch it again with my colleagues.

I was hyping them up with all the fun Deadpool facts on the way to the cinema and they were super excited to watch it. Until we reach the cinema and noticed there were no showing of Deadpool. A quick Google revealed that it is banned in Brunei. Now I got 5 angry co -workers blaming me for getting them all excited for nothing.

TL;DR: I got my colleagues excited to watch Deadpool, but forgot to check the showtimes online and it's banned in Brunei. Now they're all mad at me.

---

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of how they messed up in a particular situation. In this case, the author got their colleagues excited to watch Deadpool, but forgot to check the showtimes online and ended up wasting everyone's time.

The post is well-written and engaging, with a clear and concise summary of the situation. The use of humor and self-deprecation ("I got 5 angry co-workers blaming me for getting them all excited for nothing") makes the post entertaining and easy to read.

The subreddit r/tifu is a great platform for sharing these kinds of stories, as it allows people to share their own humorous mistakes and learn from each other's experiences. The community is supportive and non-judgmental, and the posts are often relatable and entertaining. If you're looking for a good laugh and some entertaining stories, r/tifu is definitely worth checking out!

TITLE: Girlfriend has never instigated sex.  Not once.   Advice from women pleeeasseee.

POST: I am 21 and she is 20, we have been dating for about 19months.  

This being said, we are a very sexually active couple, being a 21-year old male, I have the sex-drive of a 21-year old male.   Because of this I know she is completely comfortable with sex, never once has she denied it and she is always into it, but not even once in almost *two years* has she instigated it.  I have brought it up to her so many times and everytime she just says sorry, but then it's instantly forgotten about and *nothing* changes.

I can't figure out what to do because theres clearly not much I can do to fix it if telling her about how much it bothers me has never changed anything in the long course of time that she has known its bothered me.

If you are wondering why it bothers me it is quite simple: I see sex, when in a relationship, as a very important thing and as the most explicit way to show someone you care about them if you're willing to let them see you completely naked and you will please them.  Therefore I get greatly bothered by her never putting even an ounce of effort in to starting it off, not even making out.  I have *every single time* for almost 2 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Girlfriend has never instigated sex, not once in 2 years. I've told her it bothers me, but nothing changes. I'm 21, she's 20. We're a sexually active couple, but I feel like she's not showing me she cares.

---

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on sex being the only way to show someone you care. Maybe try having an open conversation with her about what makes you feel loved and appreciated, and see if there are other ways she can show you that."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for women to feel pressure to initiate sex, especially if their partner is more sexually driven. Maybe try having a conversation with her about how you feel, but also be open to the possibility that she's just not comfortable initiating sex. It's not about you, it's about her."
* "I think you're misunderstanding what sex means in a relationship. It's not the only way to show someone you care. Maybe try focusing on other ways to connect with each other, like having meaningful conversations or doing activities together. Sex is just one aspect of a relationship, not the only one."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for women to feel like they're being pressured into sex if their partner is always initiating it. Maybe try taking a step back and giving her space to initiate sex sometimes. It's not about you, it's about her feeling comfortable and respected in the relationship."
* "I think you're being really unfair to your girlfriend. You're putting a lot of pressure on her to initiate sex, and then getting upset when she doesn't. Maybe try being more understanding and supportive of her feelings and boundaries. It's not about you, it's about her feeling comfortable and respected in the relationship."

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [24F] for ten years broke-up six months ago; now I feel angry to myself and can't talk to people

POST: Hi.

When I was in fifth grade, at 2005, a beautiful girl asked me to be her friend; and we were together until six months ago, that's around 9-10 years. I can't remember the times I wasn't with her. I don't have a memory which doesn't include her.

I was never comfortable around people, and only with her I was relaxed, I could talk comfortably only with her, and we always said that we won't leave each ever. I was very happy.

And things start to get bad. I couldn't met her expectations. She got depressed, and I couldn't help her; I couldn't find correct words to say to her, and I couldn't make her happy. After the treatment for her depression, she (correctly) left me, and blocked me everywhere except one messaging service.

After that, I was just making myself believe that she'll be back, we'll be together and happy again. But she clearly isn't. Recently she told me that she's with someone else, he loves her very much etc. 

And there's me now. My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.

She isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.

Actually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.

Have a nice day everyone.

TL;DR: I was with my girlfriend for 10 years, we broke up 6 months ago, and I'm struggling to cope with the loss. I feel angry and numb, and I don't know how to move on. I'm trying to talk about it for the first time.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. It's completely normal to feel angry and numb after a long-term relationship ends. It's like your whole identity was tied to that relationship, and it's hard to adjust to being without it. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies.
2. **skeptical_sarah**: OP, I think you're being really hard on yourself. You can't control how your ex feels or what she does. What you can control is how you respond to the situation. Have you tried doing things that bring you joy and fulfillment? Hobbies, exercise, spending time with friends and family? Sometimes, we just need to focus on ourselves and find new sources of happiness.
3. **brokenhearted**: OP, I feel your pain. I went through a similar situation a few years ago, and it was like my whole world came crashing down. But here's the thing: you are not defined by your relationship. You are a unique, amazing person with so much to offer. Don't give up on yourself. Keep pushing forward, and remember that it's okay to take your time to heal.
4. **rational_rachel**: OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself to "get over" your ex. It's okay to take time to grieve and process your emotions. But at the same time, you can't stay stuck in the past. Have you considered setting small goals for yourself, like taking a class or trying a new hobby? Sometimes, we just need to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time.
5. **empathetic_emily**: OP, I just want to say that I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you were deeply in love, and it's okay to feel angry and hurt. But I want you to know that you are strong, capable, and deserving of love and happiness. Don't give up on yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself. You will get through this, and you will come out stronger on the other side. Sending you all my love and positive vibes.

TITLE: TIFU by having my friend change one word in a document

POST: So since it's hack your school network week I figured I'd make my first post this. This happened last year and there is a little backstory. My school has a gaming club and they download computer games (illegally) and put them on a folder in the commons folder on our schools network. So any ways me and my friend would always go to his moms room (she is a computer teacher and has a bunch of computers and let's us on our phones and shit). We on occasion would play games from the gaming club folder  until one day all the games were deleted because they were pirated but they left a note saying why they were deleted. Here is the FU.anybody is able to edit the document so I tell my friend "hey you should change one word."(badass right). He agreed to do it and changed. 2 days later the gaming club lady is at his moms room pissed off. When he changed the word it apparently said he created the document. Anyways she had our IT guys inspect every computer to see what actually happens and then proceeds to tell us "this is what happens to my gaming club when kids decide to hack the school server". needless my friends mom was really pissed when we told her what actually happens

TL;DR: I told my friend to change one word in a document, he changed the creator, and now we're in trouble.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) and their friend were trying to have some fun by editing a document, but they ended up causing a bigger problem. The friend changed the creator of the document, which led to the gaming club lady accusing them of hacking the school server. The OP's friend's mom was also upset when she found out what happened.

The post is relatable and entertaining, and the OP's use of humor and self-deprecation makes it easy to read and understand. The story is also a good reminder to be careful when editing documents and to think about the potential consequences of our actions.

The subreddit r/tifu is a great place for people to share their own stories of mistakes and mishaps, and this post is a great example of the kind of content that is shared there. It's a fun and lighthearted way for people to share their own stories and laugh at their own mistakes.

TITLE: Redditors, have you ever thought of a genius invention on your own, that later in life you found out made someone else rich?

POST: Hi reddit, I'm 19 and I currently go to Virginia Tech University in the U.S. Ever since I was little i would always come up with inventions in my mind that I didn't have the ability to make myself and would never share for no particular reason with people that could. One that I remember, that recently I found out had been invented was a machine that would tell people how many parking spaces were available and where those parking spaces were in a parking garage. I'd always hate going to the mall with my family and being stuck searching floor after floor of the garage for a spot, and thought that what if someone could create a small sensor like an invisible laser that you could install over every parking space to signal whether a car was under it or not, if the space was free it would light up and direct cars to it. This was 5 or 6 years ago when I was in middle school. The first time i saw one of those boards that tell you if a garage was full I thought to myself, wow that could've been my idea that got me rich, if only I capatilized on the thought. Yesterday as I was parking my car I noticed green lights over spaces that were free and red lights over spaces that weren't...someone had invented what I thought of years ago and put it into reality. Of course someone else deserves the money for the hard work, it just sucks to think that could've been me. Any of you have any similar stories to share?

TL;DR: OP thought of an idea for a parking space sensor system in middle school, but didn't pursue it and later found out someone else had invented it and made money from it. OP is wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

RESPONSES:

* "Dude, that's so frustrating! But also, it's not like you didn't think of it first, you just didn't have the resources or know-how to make it happen. You should be proud of yourself for coming up with the idea in the first place! And who knows, maybe you'll come up with another genius idea in the future and actually get to see it come to life"
* "I had a similar experience! I thought of an app that would allow people to order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. I didn't do anything with the idea, and years later I saw that someone else had created a similar app and was making a ton of money from it. It was frustrating, but I realized that it's not about who came up with the idea first, it's about who has the resources and ability to bring it to life"
* "I'm a software engineer and I've had a few ideas that I thought were original, only to find out that someone else had already done it. It's tough, but it's also a reminder that there are a lot of smart people out there and that ideas are often built upon each other. You should focus on what you're good at and what you're passionate about, and don't worry too much about who gets the credit"
* "I think it's great that you're sharing your story! It's a good reminder that even though we may not always get the recognition we deserve, our ideas and thoughts can still have an impact on the world. Keep thinking outside the box and who knows, maybe your next idea will be the one that changes everything"

This post and its responses highlight the common experience of having an idea that someone else later makes successful, and the emotions that come with it. The OP is frustrated that they didn't pursue their idea and that someone else made money from it, but the responses offer words of encouragement and perspective, reminding the OP that it's not about who came up with the idea first, but about who has the resources and ability to bring it to life. The post also sparks a discussion about the value of ideas and the importance of perseverance and passion in pursuing one's goals.

TITLE: Girlfriend and her ex.

POST: Hi,
Throwaway account. I'm M/22. I was with my girlfriend for about a year then we split because she went travelling. We are now back together and met up overseas and travelled for a few weeks then she has a few weeks travelling by herself before she returns home.

I have noticed she keeps in touch with her ex-boyfriends, one in particular, who she has told me a bit about but overall been very closed about it. She is going to his country visit. All she has told me is that she is staying with a "friend" there who she met when she lived there. I'm about 90% sure it's him.

My issue is not that I mind her seeing an ex boyfriend, it's that she is not open about it and still doesn't tell me when I ask her who she is staying with. 

What is the best way to bring up the fact that this makes me uncomfortable? I am going to try to address this on skype.
I've tried not to blather on too much but ask if I have forgotten any important details.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is going to visit an ex-boyfriend in his country, not telling me who she is staying with, and I'm feeling uncomfortable about it.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not being very open with you about her plans. You should definitely bring it up with her and express your feelings. It's okay to feel uncomfortable when your partner is keeping things from you. Just make sure to approach the conversation calmly and don't accuse her of anything. Try to use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements, like 'I feel uncomfortable when you don't tell me about your plans' instead of 'You're being secretive and it makes me feel bad'."
* "I think you're being a bit too controlling. She's an adult and can make her own decisions. If she wants to visit an ex, that's her choice. You should focus on building trust and communication in your relationship instead of trying to dictate what she can and can't do."
* "I agree with the first commenter. It's not about controlling her, it's about feeling left out and not being included in her plans. You should bring it up with her and have an open and honest conversation about how you're feeling. It's okay to express your needs and boundaries in a relationship."
* "I think you should be more concerned about why she's not telling you who she's staying with. Is she hiding something from you? Is she not comfortable telling you because she knows you wouldn't approve? You should try to understand her perspective and have a conversation about why she's being secretive."
* "I think you're overreacting. She's going to visit a friend, not an ex. You're assuming the worst without any evidence. Maybe you should try to relax and trust her a bit more."

**Discussion:**

The comments on this post are divided between those who think the OP should bring up his concerns with his girlfriend and those who think he's being too controlling or overreacting.

TITLE: 3 weeks later, my boss still hasn't given me a contract to sign. WTF should I do?

POST: This is a post that first started here:

I like my new job, it's with a respected firm led by a well-regarded local professor... but it's been three weeks and I still don't have a hiring contract to sign. I'm not sure what to do. He asked for all other hiring documentation (I9s, proof of insurance, voided check, etc.) but hasn't gotten a proper hiring contract for me to sign. He's been "editing it" since last week. I wrote to him in an informal email that the end of the week (today) is my personal deadline to complete paperwork, and it's almost 11 (Half day) and I don't have anything. I'm confused and hurt - this is not how you treat people, especially build trust with new employees. He's really well-respected, and this could be a lucrative post-graduate career should I stay, but how can I (and him) respect myself if I do without a contract for much longer? 

I plan to send an email saying that I've enjoyed the work thus far and am available next week as planned pending the receipt of a contract to sign, etc. Is this too demanding for a newbie? Am I a pushover? 
WTF do I do and still hold my head high, here at work and in general?
Also, if I send that email, will it fuck up our relationship as mentor-mentee?

TL;DR: 3 weeks in, no contract, boss "editing" it. What do I do? Should I send an email or just wait it out?

---

This post is an example of a common problem that many people face in their careers, particularly in the early stages of employment. The OP (original poster) is feeling frustrated and unsure of what to do about the lack of a contract, which is a crucial document that outlines the terms of their employment. The OP is also concerned about the impact this may have on their relationship with their boss and the company.

The post is well-written and provides relevant context, including the fact that the boss is a well-respected professor and the OP is eager to build a positive relationship with them. The OP is also aware of the importance of professionalism and is seeking advice on how to navigate this situation without damaging their reputation.

The post has received a number of comments and responses, including suggestions on how to approach the situation, such as sending a polite but firm email to the boss, and seeking advice from HR or a labor lawyer. The post has also sparked a discussion about the importance of contracts in employment and the potential consequences of not having one.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide valuable advice and support to people navigating challenging situations in their personal and professional lives.

TITLE: How do I respond to people I work with asking how old I am? (26f)

POST: I started college when I was 17 and knew what I wanted to do right off the bat, so at this point I've been in my field for nearly a decade (I had a job in college in my field). I also got married at 19 and had my first child at 20, and I'm very good at my job (I'm a graphic designer/marketer) so I am in a position in life that is usually normal for someone about five or more years older than I am.

I feel capable at my job and in my element running meetings with men twice my age, but every once in awhile someone I work with in some capacity will ask me how old I am. Frankly, I don't want to tell people, I'd rather it be ambiguous. I've noticed a marked difference in the way people respond to me once they have confirmed that yes, I'm younger than they think I am and don't just have a fantastic skin care regimen. How do I respond? Do I lie? Do I just live with it? Is there any professional way at all to respond to that question without saying 'none of your business'?

TL;DR: How do I respond to coworkers asking how old I am without revealing my age and without being rude?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Honestly, I think it's okay to just say "I'd rather not share that" or "it's not relevant to our conversation". It's not like you're hiding anything, you're just not comfortable sharing that info. If someone pushes for an answer, you can always say "I'd rather focus on the project/task at hand" or something similar.
2. **designerdude**: I'm a bit older than you, but I've had similar experiences. I usually just laugh it off and say "I'm old enough to know what I'm doing, but young enough to still be learning". It's a lighthearted way to deflect the question and shift the focus back to the work.
3. **marketingmaven**: I think it's totally fine to say "I'd rather not share that" or "it's not relevant to our conversation". If someone is really pushy, you can always say "I'd rather focus on the project/task at hand" or "I'm more interested in discussing [specific topic]". Remember, your age is not a relevant factor in your work performance or abilities.
4. **graphicguru**: I've had similar experiences, and I usually just say "I'm not comfortable sharing that information". It's not about being rude, it's about respecting your own boundaries. If someone is really pushy, you can always say "I'd rather not discuss my personal life" or "I'm here to focus on the work, not my age".
5. **careercoach**: I think it's important to remember that your age is not a relevant factor in your work performance or abilities. It's okay to say "I'd rather not share that" or "it's not relevant to our conversation". If someone is really pushy, you can always say "I'd rather focus on the project/task at hand" or "I'm more interested in discussing [specific topic]". Remember, your age is not a reflection of your worth or abilities as a professional.

TITLE: ELI5 Why is it some people get assignment done in no time and others take forever?

POST: I always considered myself pretty average when it comes to assignment (you know like 5 page long essays) I really never had any motivation, but I can tell you for sure, and this holds true even at university: It takes me 1h per page, search / planning included. 

If I have a 5 page essay, it will take me 5 to 7h (depending if I take breaks)

Today, I did 3 assignments of 4 pages in 14hours, two of which I had to research sources. 

I really don't mean to brag and this kind of "ability?" always made my work feel worthless, as I feel like I'm putting no effort in it.

When speaking to classmates, they planned 3 days for 1 of the assignment, now I do proclaim the same thing to my family, but truth is the 3 days would be spent playing video games and what not, and the actual work will pretty much always be done day before due.

TL;DR: I can do 5 page essays in 5-7h, while others take 3 days. Why is that?

---

**ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**

Hey there! So, you're wondering why some people can finish their assignments quickly, while others take a long time? Let me break it down for you like you're 5 years old!

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and you need to build a specific castle. Some people might take their time, carefully planning each step, making sure every brick is in the right place. They might even make a little drawing of the castle before they start building. This is like the "planning" part of doing an assignment.

On the other hand, some people might just start building the castle without a plan. They might start with the walls, then add the towers, and finally add the details. This is like the "searching" part of doing an assignment.

Now, when it comes to doing an assignment, some people might be really good at planning and researching, so they can finish it quickly. They might have a system that works for them, like making a list of what they need to do, or breaking down the assignment into smaller tasks.

On the other hand, some people might struggle with planning and researching, so they take longer to finish their assignment. They might get distracted, or have trouble finding the right information.

So, it's not that one person is better than the other, it's just that they have different ways of working. And that's okay! We all learn and work in different ways, and that's what makes the world interesting.

**Additional comments:**

* "I think it's because some people are more efficient with their time. They know how to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively."
* "I'm one of those people who takes forever to do assignments. I'm a perfectionist and I like to make sure everything is just right. It takes me a lot of time to research and organize my thoughts."
* "I think it's also because some people are more experienced with doing assignments. They know what to expect and how to approach it, so they can finish it faster."
* "I'm a procrastinator, and I always put off my assignments until the last minute. But when I do finally start working on it, I can finish it quickly because I'm focused and motivated."
* "I think it's because some people are more creative and can come up with ideas quickly. They might not need to spend as much time researching and planning."
* "I'm a slow worker, but I'm also very thorough. I like to make sure I understand the material before I start writing, so it takes me a little longer to finish my assignments."
* "I think it's because some people are more organized and have a system in place for doing their assignments. They might have a checklist or a schedule that helps them stay on track."
* "I'm a fast worker, but I'm also a bit of a perfectionist. I like to make sure my work is perfect, so I spend a lot of time editing and revising."
* "I think it's because some people are more motivated and have a clear goal in mind. They might be working towards a specific grade or a certain outcome, so they're more focused and driven."
* "I'm a slow worker, but I'm also very detail-oriented. I like to make sure every little thing is just right, so it takes me a little longer to finish my assignments."

TITLE: Reddit, I met my soul mate and was so in awe with him.. until I found out he dropped out of community college and has been a full-time cashier ever since. I'm a doctor who makes six digits.

POST: We talked for hours and shared our interests, many of which we share. I became so infatuated with everything about him.. he is literally a male version of me. Then I found out he dropped out of community college and has been working as a cashier at a convenience store ever since.

Reddit, is it wrong that I suddenly became unattracted to him? Comparably, I have a high-paying job and I feel like taking this relationship any further, and even possibly to marriage, just couldn't work out. I feel *terrible* but does anyone understand my situation that can offer advice on what I should do? Am I wrong to think about it from a logical point of view, rather than a "this could be my soul mate" point?

TL;DR: Met my soul mate, but found out he dropped out of community college and has been a cashier for years. I'm a doctor with a high-paying job and feel like our lifestyles are too different. Should I continue the relationship or end it?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not wrong to think about it from a logical point of view. You're a doctor, and he's a cashier. Your lifestyles are vastly different, and it's not just about the money. You're going to have different expectations, values, and goals. It's not fair to either of you to pretend like it's not a big deal."
* "I think you're being a bit harsh. Just because he didn't finish college doesn't mean he's not a good person. Maybe he's happy with his life and doesn't feel the need to pursue further education. You should get to know him better and see if you can find common ground."
* "I'm a cashier too, and I'm proud of my job. It's not about the prestige or the pay, it's about the people you meet and the experiences you have. Don't judge him based on his job, judge him based on who he is as a person."
* "You're a doctor, and you're worried about his lack of education? That's rich. You should be worried about his lack of ambition and drive. If he's happy with his life, that's one thing, but if he's not striving to be better, that's a problem."
* "I think you're overthinking this. You met someone you like, and you're worried about the logistics of the relationship. Just enjoy the time you have together and see where it takes you. Don't worry about what other people think or what your friends will say."
* "I'm a doctor too, and I can tell you that it's not just about the money. It's about the respect and admiration you have for each other. If you don't respect his choices and decisions, then maybe this isn't the right relationship for you."

This post highlights the challenges of navigating relationships when there are significant differences in lifestyle, education, and career. The original poster (OP) is torn between their feelings for their partner and their concerns about the practicalities of the relationship. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from understanding and empathetic to critical and judgmental. Some commenters emphasize the importance of respecting each other's choices and decisions, while others highlight the potential challenges and difficulties that may arise from the significant differences in their lifestyles. Ultimately, the OP must weigh their feelings and concerns and decide what is best for them.

TITLE: I [M 18] just found a girl [F 18] whom I've only met a few times on FB recently-after two years of not talking.

POST: So the first time I met this girl about 2 years go at church- I felt an instant connection with her. I finally found her on Facebook and we've been talking. She's ok with hanging out-and I dont think I'm in the friend-zone because she's so open to go out. But she just posted a relationship update to make it "Facebook" official. What would be a good plan? We're getting together in a little over a month to shop around at a record store, a hippie shop, etc. I just feel like even though I don't know her that well it was like a spiritual and emotional connection. But she's in a relationship which I assume is serious. Should I assert my feelings for her when we meet up? I'm not sure what to do-in my mind she's life partner/wife material because she seems perfect for me. At this point in y life I really don't want a girlfriend or children but she makes me think otherwise.

TL;DR: Met girl 2 years ago at church, felt connection, recently reconnected on FB, she's in a relationship, but I feel a strong connection and think she's perfect for me. Should I assert my feelings when we meet up?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Dude, you're 18 and you're already thinking about life partner/wife material? Take a step back and focus on getting to know her as a person, not just as a potential partner. You don't even know her that well yet.
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: I would say it's best to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. However, it's also important to respect her current relationship and boundaries. Maybe you could ask her how she feels about you and if there's a possibility of something more in the future.
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're 18 and you're already thinking about settling down with someone? That's not healthy. You need to focus on yourself and your own personal growth before you start thinking about someone else.
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: I think it's sweet that you feel a strong connection with her, but you need to respect her current relationship. Maybe you could try to get to know her better as a friend and see if there's a possibility of something more in the future when she's single.
5. **u/cynical_sam**: Dude, you're 18 and you're already thinking about settling down with someone? That's not even a thing. You're still in high school, for crying out loud! Just enjoy the ride and don't get too caught up in your feelings. You don't even know her that well yet.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the advice guys. I think I'm just going to take a step back and focus on getting to know her as a person. I don't want to rush into anything and I definitely don't want to disrespect her current relationship. I'll just try to be honest with her and see where things go. Thanks again for the advice!

TITLE: Reddit, who is the most important person in your life, and why?

POST: Mine is simple, my kids. I will always remember the one day my daughter made me feel like the best dad in the world. I sometimes have to go back to work late at night to attend meetings (I work for a place with offices around the world) and one day I was home before my family was done with school. I decided to make some dinner and leave it for them and while I was making it I spotted some cookie dough in the fridge. I thought it would be nice to leave them cookies. So when my wife picks the kids up from daycare she said my daughter seemed to have a rough day (as rough as a 5 year old can have, I guess) and was very grumpy/sad. When they got home my son smelled the curry I had made and got very excited and then my daughter found the cookies. I had left a little note saying to enjoy the cookies and sorry for having to work late. My daughter started to cry and said she was so happy. My wife took a short video and sent it to me at work. I have never felt more needed and counted upon, then that. I know that these kids will cause me all kinds of worry throughout our lives, but I wouldn't trade that feeling of unconditional love for anything.

TL;DR: OP's kids make him feel like the most important person in his life because they showed him how much they care and need him.

COMMENTS:

* "That's amazing! I'm sure your kids will always remember that moment and cherish it. You're an amazing dad!"
* "I love this story! It's so sweet. I'm sure your kids will always look up to you as a role model."
* "I'm getting emotional just reading this. You're an amazing dad and your kids are lucky to have you."
* "This is so heartwarming! I'm sure your kids will always remember the cookies and the note. You're an amazing dad!"
* "I'm a single mom and it's hard to feel like I'm doing enough for my kids. This story made me feel a little better. Thanks for sharing!"
* "This is so beautiful! I'm sure your kids will always cherish the memories they make with you. You're an amazing dad!"
* "I'm getting a little choked up just reading this. You're an amazing dad and your kids are lucky to have you. Thanks for sharing this story!"

This post is a heartwarming story about a father's relationship with his children. The OP shares a personal anecdote about a moment when his daughter showed him how much she cared and needed him, and how it made him feel like the most important person in his life. The comments are overwhelmingly positive, with many people praising the OP for being an amazing dad and sharing a beautiful story. The post and comments are a great example of the kind of community and support that can be found on Reddit.

TITLE: My disabled little sister is getting bullied. What advice can I give her?

POST: My little sister is 14 years old and has cerebral palsy. She is functionally fine except for her legs. She's been in a wheel chair most of her life but can walk, albeit not very far, with a frame. My mum is quite overprotective of her and she doesn't go out of the house except for school and the times I take her to the movies or whatnot. 

Her only real friend is a kid named Jordan who she only knows because he is the kid of one of my mums friends. He's a few years younger than her and they don't go to the same school.

I live with my girlfriend and don't see my sister as much as I once did but when I went to visit last weekend she told me she was getting bullied at school. Apparently a lot of the kids have taken to calling her a lesbian and this is upsetting her quite a bit. I asked my mum about it and she said it's been going on for awhile and she's spoken to her teachers about it. But this doesn't seem to have done anything.

We didn't actually discuss whether she was a lesbian or not, apart from the fact that that is just not a conversation I want to have with ANY person that is 11 years my junior, especially not my baby sister it's just not something that really concerns either of us. We've talked about being gay in the past, as our next door neighbors are a gay couple that come over just about every other day, and she is very much of the opinion that it just doesn't matter who you love, as long you're happy.

There wasn't really a lot of advice I could give her outside of "aim for the throat". I too was bullied at school and eventually it stopped because I started to pummel the people doing it, but as you can imagine that's not really something I can tell my sister to do, even if she was actually capable of doing it.

So basically has anyone got any advice I can give to her?

TL;DR: My 14 year old sister with cerebral palsy is getting bullied at school and I'm at a loss for what to say to her. She's being called a lesbian and it's really upsetting her. I don't want to tell her to fight back because that's not an option for her. Any advice would be appreciated.

TITLE: Whats your best "control your fucking kid" moment you have ever seen? Here's mine..

POST: So the people across the street from me have ended up adopting about 5 kids. The youngest one (about 5) constantly runs all around the neighborhood annoying the shit out of everyone. Her parents are never home and she is allowed to do basically what ever she wants (I'm pretty sure she has some metal issues as well). So about an hour ago I hear some sirens and I look out the window to see an ambulance in front of the house down the street. I go outside and stand on the driveway to get a better view and what do I see? The little brat of a kid is running around the EMTs and actually trying to go into the house where they are working. While all of this is happening her parents and older siblings are no where to be found. I really wish they would just move already...

TL;DR: The kid across the street is a little terror and her parents are never home, so I got to see an ambulance show up and the kid try to run into the house where the EMTs were working.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "I've seen some crazy stuff in my neighborhood, but this takes the cake. I hope the parents get their act together before someone gets hurt."
* "I feel for the neighbors, but at the same time, it's not like the kid is doing anything malicious. She's just a kid who needs attention and boundaries. Maybe the parents are overwhelmed and need some support?"
* "I've seen some crazy stuff in my neighborhood too, but this is just ridiculous. I hope the parents get a wake-up call and realize they need to take care of their kid before it's too late."
* "I'm a parent and I can attest that it's not easy. But at the same time, it's not okay to let your kid run wild and put others in danger. Maybe the parents need some counseling or support to help them manage their kid's behavior."
* "I've seen some crazy stuff in my neighborhood too, but this is just ridiculous. I hope the parents get a wake-up call and realize they need to take care of their kid before it's too late."

This post is an example of a "control your fucking kid" moment, where the author is expressing frustration and annoyance at the behavior of the child across the street. The post is likely to elicit a strong reaction from other Redditors, with some people agreeing with the author and others taking a more sympathetic view of the situation. The post also highlights the challenges that some parents face in managing their children's behavior and the importance of providing support and resources to help them do so.

TITLE: Any got a snappy, subtle comeback for a juvenile and jealous fellow suitor? (in text?)

POST: So this girl I know was in a picture with me in one of those poses, you know, where one of you is holding the camera at arms length? It got posted on facebook, real cute. Anyway, another guy we both know who is younger than us by 4 years has a massive crush on her. He spends way more time with her than I do, because I work a lot, and it's pretty obvious to everyone.

Thing is, though, this girl is real flirty to other guys, particularly me, partly because I'm the next-most present person, but also because I'm just swell. He doesn't like it. And as the immature bozo he is, he takes potshots at me occasionally (in words of course) especially when the flirting is afoot. Now, I'm not one to bother getting into it with him (he's like 6'5'') because that will surely get me nowhere.

That was my position on it UNTIL he commented on the photo. In it, we happen to be dressed as avatars for a halloween party, and it just so happens that I have reddish long hair so I just braided it rather than get a black wig. I commented in the pic that I look crazy. Well this wise guy, who was also at the party as an avatar painted blue, decides to comment on it with, "you're covered in blue makeup and have your hair braided like a kindergarten school girl... I think your crazy is more internal than aesthetic."

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I thought he was a friendly dude I'd laugh it off, agree and all. But no. Now it's posted on facebook for the internets to see it. LAME NO THX. So I feel the need to post a snappy but subtle comeback. AND YOU CAN HELP!

TL;DR: Juvenile suitor takes potshots at me, comments on a photo saying I'm crazy, and I need a snappy comeback.

HELP! What do I say? I want it to be witty, but not too mean-spirited. I want it to be a "oh, you think you're clever, but really you're just a big ol' goofball" kind of thing. I want it to be something that will make him look like a total dweeb, but not so much that it'll escalate the situation.

Please help! I'm dying over here!

**Author's response:**

"Thanks for all the suggestions! I think I'll go with the first one: 'I'm not crazy, I'm just a little blue'... it's a nice play on words and doesn't escalate the situation. I'll make sure to keep it light-hearted and not take the bait. Thanks for the help, Reddit!"

TITLE: TIFU by having a shitty morning and going to McDonald's

POST: About two days ago actually I had a really shitty morning.

Firstly my alarm does not go off. So I didn't have breakfast. Rush to the train station and I miss my train by 15 seconds.

So, minding my own business as I finally make it to my campus I decide to hit up McDonald's (their hash browns are really nice in Australia).
So as I'm walking down campus to get breakfast I hear a whirling sound. Wheels. Roller blades?

I turn my head around and for about half a second I spot a little girl maybe 4 or 5 years old on a scooter. Then suddenly everything stops and I hear a sickening bang. I didn't feel anything so I thought I imagined it but sure enough she had fallen over, her little razor scooter tipped over with her.

I freak out and ask her if she's okay, if she's bleeding, if her parents are nearby. On the inside I was swearing like a sailor.

Luckily her dad was not too far behind, along with the girl's little sister. She wasn't hurt, there was no bleeding and by the end of it they're all consoling me instead.

TL;DR: I had a terrible morning, missed my train, and then almost got into an accident with a little girl on a scooter. I ended up having a really nice conversation with her and her family instead.

TITLE: [28/F] Trying to be classy. And date several guys at once.

POST: I recently got out of a long term relationship and am sick of being a serial monogamist. My goal for right now is to go out on actual dates (dinner, drinks, coffee) with different men, and go out on several dates and get to know them as people, and then selectively get physical with them if it feels right. Its working pretty well: I've made it clear to them that I am in no way ready for a commitment and they've each acknowledged that.

Except I finally slept with one. And he's very into me. And texts me all the time. I hate texting in general and frequently don't return texts.  (I have told him that I suck at texting but still texts me all the time). Now I'm feeling like I'm going to break his heart, even though expectations were on the table. 

Do I (1) need an attitude adjustment because I've been clear about my expectations with each person or (2) am I playing with fire and potentially being irresponsible by engaging with people in a romantic context and then only responding to their texts/calls when it suits me? (I'm also a genuinely busy person).

I am open to general advice as well on actual dating and balancing sex and communication. (The only person I know who went on a lot of actual dates is my very old/old fashioned grandmother, and she definitely could not relate to a Tinder world.)

TL;DR: I'm trying to date multiple guys at once, and one of them is getting too attached. I've been clear about my expectations, but now I'm feeling guilty about not responding to his texts all the time.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. You're saying you want to date multiple people, but then you're getting attached to one of them and feeling guilty about it. You need to decide what you want and be honest with yourself and the people you're dating. If you're not ready for a commitment, then don't lead someone on by sleeping with them and then ignoring their texts. It's not fair to them, and it's not fair to yourself."
2. **DatingCoach**: "I think you're being a bit too focused on the'multiple guys at once' aspect and not enough on the actual relationships themselves. Instead of trying to juggle multiple people, why not focus on getting to know each person individually and seeing where things go? If you're not feeling a connection with someone, it's okay to move on and not waste their time. And if someone is getting too attached, it's okay to have an honest conversation with them about your feelings and boundaries."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're being a bit unrealistic about your expectations. You're saying you want to date multiple people, but then you're getting attached to one of them and feeling guilty about it. That's not how dating works. You can't just sleep with someone and then ignore their texts and expect them not to get attached. You need to be honest with yourself and the people you're dating about what you want and what you're willing to commit to."
4. **RelationshipRookie**: "I think you're being a bit too focused on the'multiple guys at once' aspect and not enough on the actual relationships themselves.

If you're not feeling a connection with someone, it's okay to move on and not waste their time.

**General advice:**

* Be honest with yourself and the people you're dating about what you want and what you're willing to commit to.
* Focus on getting to know each person individually and seeing where things go, rather than trying to juggle multiple people at once.
* If someone is getting too attached, it's okay to have an honest conversation with them about your feelings and boundaries.
* Don't lead someone on by sleeping with them and then ignoring their texts. It's not fair to them, and it's not fair to yourself.
* Be realistic about your expectations and don't try to have your cake and eat it too. You can't just sleep with someone and then ignore their texts and expect them not to get attached.

TITLE: [31 F] with friend [24 F] want her happy but don't want to lead her on

POST: We've seen each other around, but only recently are we friends.  Yes, there's attraction there (she's lesbian, I'm non-cis). 
I'm in a long term committed relationship (friend is aware).
She's in a 2 yr committed relationship.
Her girlfriend treats her poorly. She's aware of it.  She's unhappy.

I'm a supportive person, and even the most basic nice things you say to friends (you look nice! thanks for the delicious dinner! It's cool you like "x") is shocking to her. 

I want her to find someone who treats her right.  Treats her how she deserves.  It's too early for me to butt in specifically. But I want to drop hints that she deserves better, without implying that I am that something better.

What makes it so difficult is that if I had met her earlier in my life this wouldn't even be a debate.

Any Ideas?

TL;DR: Friend in unhappy relationship, I want her to find someone who treats her right, but I don't want to lead her on. How can I drop hints without being too obvious?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're looking out for her, but maybe just be a good listener and let her know you're there for her. Don't try to fix her problems or tell her what she should do. Just be a supportive friend and let her know you care."
* "I agree with the above comment. Sometimes people just need someone to talk to and feel heard. You can be that person for her without trying to fix her relationship or imply that you're the solution to her problems."
* "I think it's okay to express your concerns to her in a non-judgmental way. You could say something like 'Hey, I've noticed you seem really unhappy lately. Is everything okay?' or 'I care about you and I want you to be happy. Is there anything I can do to support you?' Just be genuine and empathetic and let her know you're there for her."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about her happiness, but maybe just focus on being a good friend and let her figure things out for herself. You can't force someone to leave a bad relationship or find someone new. Just be there for her and support her in whatever she decides to do."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Let her know that you care about her and you want her to be happy, but also be clear that you're not looking to replace her girlfriend or get involved in a romantic way. Just be genuine and respectful and let her know you're there for her."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I think I was worried about being too obvious or leading her on, but your suggestions have given me some good ideas. I think I'll just focus on being a good listener and letting her know I'm there for her. I'll also try to express my concerns in a non-judgmental way, like the comment suggested. And I'll definitely keep in mind that I can't force her to leave her relationship or find someone new. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: I just noticed I don't have full access to my boyfriend's facebook profile. Should I be concerned?

POST: I'm pretty sure this is a stupid thing to be concerned about in the grand scheme of things, but I could use some input.

I was looking for one of his friends who got married recently (couldn't remember her amended last name, but I knew they were facebook friends) so I went to his profile to check his friends and locate her. But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. 

Now, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them. 

The thing is, I don't think I'm an overly clingy girlfriend (and he has said numerous times that I'm not). I don't try to control every aspect of his life. So I'm not sure why I no longer have full access. 

I'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.

Is it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide? I'm not going to fly off the handle; it's just that his track record has been such that this could be nothing, or it could be SUPER HUGE, and I won't know until it's too late.

TL;DR: Boyfriend's Facebook profile won't show me his full friends list, and I'm wondering if it's an oversight or if he's hiding something. Should I ask him about it, and how should I approach the conversation?

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in online communities: the "relationship anxiety" post. The OP (original poster) is experiencing feelings of uncertainty and insecurity in their relationship and is seeking reassurance and advice from the community. In this case, the OP is concerned about their boyfriend's Facebook profile and whether he is hiding something from them.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the situation. The OP is honest about their feelings and is seeking a non-judgmental and supportive response from the community. The post also includes a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) summary, which is a common feature of Reddit posts.

The community's response to this post is likely to be a mix of advice, reassurance, and humor. Some users may offer suggestions for how the OP can approach the conversation with their boyfriend, while others may try to reassure the OP that their concerns are unfounded. A few users may even offer humorous takes on the situation, such as suggesting that the boyfriend is hiding a secret Facebook account or that the OP is just being paranoid.

Overall, this post is a great example of how online communities can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for people to share their concerns and receive advice and reassurance.

TITLE: TIFU by taking my ex out for dinner

POST: Ok. So like many posts this FU was not today, but back in December. 

BACKSTORY: I had dated this girl freshman year of Highschool. Things were good, but I broke up with her out of peer pressure. I was a self conscious Freshman with little self esteem. I regretted it for years, and the fact we ended up being FWB a couple times did not help. 

So we both get through our first semester of college, myself at a school in Tx, her in Ok. Didn't see each other often, but we did snapchat back and forth once and a while. Well over break she says she is tired of being single, her ex was shitty, blah blah blah. I offer to take her out.

We both dress up, and I took her to this little seafood restaurant, and go see a movie after. The movie I wanted to see so that wasn't really a problem. But I paid for all of it. Every dime.

Throughout the course of the evening all the repressed feelings I had resurfaced, we kissed, it was a bomb time. 

At the end she asks me to drive her to her ex's place. Are you kidding me?!? Which then she calls me right after break to tell me she's dating him again. 

So cool, now I have this slight feeling of desire, mixed with the burning hatred from being screwed.

TL;DR: Took my ex out for dinner, got feelings back, kissed, and then she went back to her ex. TIFU

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "TIFU by thinking you could just buy your way back into her heart"
* "TIFU by not setting boundaries and letting her guilt trip you into taking her out"
* "TIFU by not being honest with yourself about your feelings and why you took her out"
* "TIFU by not respecting your own worth and letting her treat you like a rebound"
* "TIFU by not learning from your past mistakes and repeating them"

The subreddit r/tifu (Today I F**ked Up) is a community where people share their stories of mistakes, regrets, and embarrassing moments. The post above is a classic example of a TIFU story, where the author reflects on a past mistake and shares it with the community to learn from it and get feedback. The comments section is filled with people sharing their own TIFU stories and offering advice and support to the original poster. The subreddit is a great place to share your own TIFU stories and get a sense of community and support from others who have made similar mistakes.

TITLE: I [17 M] just read a comment that makes me feel quite hopeless.. /r/relationships, is it true that it's always the same experience you have with someone you like?

POST: >Those who have dated a lot (and the people who made Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) will tell you that you end up desiring the same type of person over and over again. It's the same restaurants, the same conversations, the same jokes, the same view of familiar places, the same stories of your childhood told to a slightly different person with slightly different looks and habits. A slightly obscure author said, "I like young girls. Their stories are shorter."

Is this true? Because it makes me lose all hope of ever having a meaningful relationship with anyone if all I'm ever gonna find in someone else is just some lesser version of [this](

Hell, I got depressed watching Her because the main character seemed to be doing and saying things almost exactly the same as I did. So if she (a girl I liked ) is all that  I'm gonna see in someone else, then what's the point in any of this?

TL;DR: I'm 17 and I just read a comment that makes me feel hopeless about relationships. It says that you always end up desiring the same type of person over and over again, and that it's the same experiences and conversations. Is this true? I feel like it's taking away my hope of having a meaningful relationship.

**Comment 1:**
Hey OP, I'm 25 and I've been in a few relationships. I can attest that there's some truth to this. I've found myself drawn to people who share similar interests, values, and sense of humor as me. It's not that I'm looking for a carbon copy of someone I've dated before, but rather that I'm attracted to people who understand and appreciate me for who I am.

That being said, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It's okay to have a sense of familiarity and comfort with someone. It's what makes relationships feel like home. And who says you can't grow and change with someone? Maybe the next person you date will challenge you and help you become a better version of yourself.

Don't lose hope, OP! There are plenty of people out there who can bring new experiences and perspectives to the table. Keep an open mind and heart, and you never know what might happen.

**Comment 2:**
I'm 30 and I've been in a few long-term relationships. I think the comment you read is partially true, but it's not the whole story. While it's true that we tend to attract people who share similar interests and values, it's also important to remember that people are complex and multifaceted. There's always going to be something new and unexpected about someone you date.

I think the key is to focus on building a connection with someone, rather than just looking for someone who checks off a list of boxes. When you're genuinely interested in getting to know someone and learning about their life, you'll find that there's always something new to discover.

Don't give up hope, OP! There are plenty of people out there who are looking for meaningful connections. Keep being your awesome self and the right person will come along.

**Comment 3:**
Hey OP, I'm 22 and I've been in a few relationships. I think the comment you read is a bit exaggerated. While it's true that we tend to attract people who share similar interests and values, it's not always the same experiences and conversations. People are unique and have their own stories to tell.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my [26 F]. Chemistry/kissing problem. Is it just not meant to be?

POST: A girl that I've known for a few years and I began hooking up recently. I'm extremely attracted to her; we have tons in common and just generally get on great and have become very close. However, the kissing is just..awkward. 

We both have different styles and both want to seem to lead. We acknowledged it and tried to work on it. I kissed her my way and she tried to follow suit but we just weren't synching up and couldn't get into a rhythm. She got paranoid then and wouldn't kiss me the way she usually goes about it.

She's pretty much conceded that it's a deal breaker and that we just don't have sexual chemistry. I'm not so sure. Yes, it was awkward but I wanted to work on it and hopefully we'd eventually get there, and I was still turned on during it.

Everything else is perfect apart from this one thing.  I really thought I might have something with this girl.  It's something that's never ever happened either of us before.. kissing just comes naturally right? Or at least you usually adjust to what's happening. Maybe we put too much pressure on fixing it?

Just wondering what peoples thoughts are on this? Are people sometimes just meant to be very good friends? Is it a sign of no sexual chemistry?

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have different kissing styles and we can't seem to get into a rhythm. She thinks it's a deal breaker and we don't have sexual chemistry. I'm not so sure. Thoughts?

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's a sign that you two are not meant to be intimate. Kissing is a natural thing, and if it's not working out, it might be a sign that you're not compatible in that way."
* "I think it's a bit of a red flag. If you're both trying to make it work and it's still not happening, it might be a sign that you're not compatible in the long run."
* "I think it's worth having a conversation about what you both want and need. Maybe there's something specific that's not working for one or both of you, and you can work on that together."
* "I think it's a bit of a myth that kissing comes naturally. People have different styles and preferences, and it's okay if it takes some practice to get it right."
* "I think it's a sign that you two need to work on communication and intimacy. Maybe you're putting too much pressure on the kissing, and you need to focus on building a deeper connection."
* "I think it's a sign that you two are not compatible. If you're both trying to make it work and it's still not happening, it might be a sign that you're not meant to be together."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are mixed, with some people thinking that the lack of chemistry in kissing is a sign that the couple is not meant to be together, while others think that it's a sign that they need to work on communication and intimacy. Some people suggest that it's a normal part of relationships and that it's okay if it takes some practice to get it right. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to continue the relationship depends on the couple's individual circumstances and what they are looking for in a relationship.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my [25F] together 5 months and she has issues over FB photos and posts from past relationship.

POST: So this girl and I have been in a pretty serious relationship for the past 5ish months. She is a little older and has a 5 year old girl from a past relationship that I have just fallen in love with. I have always wanted kids and this has given me a taste of what it is like to be a Daddy.

We both love each other very much and the kid and I both love each other as well. I have taken the little girl fishing, to the zoo, on walks with the dog, etc.

My SO and I have lived together about two months and it has been a little rocky because of our situation but in terms of the relationship between us it has been great.

We met each other in detox and I went to rehab for a few months. We talked while I was there and when I got home we got together.

Not too long after we started getting serious and I started getting involved with the kid she started asking a lot of questions about my ex because of things she saw on Facebook. She believes that my ex is still in love with me and that since we were together so long and still has a lot of pictures up of us together, of which I was also guilty. She asked about a couple casual conversations that my ex and I had in the last few months and I told her honestly that it was just casual conversation.

She seems to think the contrary and believes that it is only a matter of time before we end up getting back together. I tell her there is no way in hell I would do that regardless of being in a relationship or not but she is persistent.

She is so afraid I am going to break her and her daughter's hearts.

I don't know what else to say to her at this point. I deleted all our photos, unfriended her, told her to please take hers down.

This has not done anything to persuade my SO otherwise.

I just want a little perspective on what this is all about or what the next possible moves on my part could be.

I really love this woman and her little girl and I dont want to lose them.

TL;DR: GF has issues with my ex's Facebook photos and posts, thinks I'll end up with her again. I've told her it's just casual conversation, deleted our photos, unfriended her, and asked her to take hers down. Still not convinced. What can I do?

---

**Top comments:**

* "It sounds like your SO is struggling with trust and insecurity. You've done what you can to address the issue, but it's clear that she's still not convinced. You might need to have a deeper conversation with her about what's really going on and why she's so worried about your ex. It's possible that there's more to the story than just casual conversations."
* "I think you need to have a conversation with your SO about what she's really afraid of. Is it the possibility of you getting back together with your ex, or is it something deeper? Is she worried about losing you or being replaced? Once you understand what's driving her fears, you can start working on addressing them together."
* "I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. If your SO is this insecure and controlling, it may not be a healthy relationship for you. You deserve to be with someone who trusts and respects you, not someone who is constantly questioning your loyalty and intentions."
* "I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with your SO about this. Explain to her that you understand why she might be worried, but that you're committed to your relationship with her and her daughter. You could also offer to do some couples therapy to work through these issues together."
* "I think you need to be honest with yourself about whether or not you're willing to work through these issues with your SO. If you're not, then it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and consider moving on. You deserve to be with someone who is happy and secure in your relationship."

TITLE: Small community org trying to get teens involved. ideas?

POST: so this is a little bit of the old "le sigh, how do we get teens to care" and part of it--well, no that's most of it.

I work for a small community organization in Brooklyn, NY and my job is to try to get high school kids involved in our programs and the community (and programs involving them being involved in the community)

aside from making our posters say "come to our super cool program" and making the background a cat, what else can we do that kids could get interested in? I don't just want programs they come to (yes, those too), but I want them to feel empowered and I want it to be more than JUST because of marketing--though I'm happy to take marketing ideas as well, I'd love getting more people to know that we're doing super cool things    

the community is famously homogeneous but I'd like to avoid pandering to stereotypes ideally I'd like to get the entire community involved in something environmental and local (growing cucumbers for pickling for example), helping clean a local place of worship...  

I'm sure others have had lots of experience with things that have worked (or maybe could/could've worked).  
what have you got?

TL;DR: Trying to get high school kids involved in a small community org in Brooklyn, NY. Looking for ideas to make them feel empowered and engaged, beyond just marketing. Want to avoid stereotypes and focus on environmental/local projects.

REPLIES:

1. **Create a youth-led initiative**: Let the teens take the lead on a project that they're passionate about. This could be anything from organizing a community clean-up to creating a mural in a local park. By giving them ownership and autonomy, you'll be more likely to get them engaged and invested in the project.

2. **Collaborate with local schools**: Reach out to local schools and ask if they'd be interested in partnering with your organization. This could involve hosting workshops or events at the school, or even having students participate in your programs. By working with schools, you'll be able to reach a wider audience and build relationships with teachers and administrators.

3. **Use social media**: Utilize social media platforms to reach out to teens and promote your programs. Create engaging content that showcases the work you're doing and the impact it's having. Use hashtags and tag relevant influencers or organizations to increase visibility.

4. **Host events that appeal to teens**: Organize events that are relevant and appealing to teens, such as concerts, movie nights, or gaming tournaments. These events can be a great way to bring teens together and create a sense of community.

5. **Offer flexible volunteer opportunities**: Many teens have busy schedules, so offer flexible volunteer opportunities that can be adapted to their needs. This could include virtual volunteering, weekend volunteering, or even one-day events.

6. **Create a youth advisory board**: Establish a youth advisory board that consists of teens who are passionate about your organization's mission. This board can provide valuable feedback and insights on how to better engage with teens and make your programs more appealing to them.

7. **Partner with local businesses**: Partner with local businesses to offer discounts or promotions to teens who participate in your programs. This can be a great way to incentivize teens to get involved and build relationships with local businesses.

8. **Use storytelling**: Share stories of teens who have been impacted by your organization's programs. Use social media and other platforms to share their stories and highlight the positive impact that your organization is having on their lives.

9. **Offer leadership opportunities**: Provide leadership opportunities for teens to take on roles within your organization. This could include leading a project, mentoring younger teens, or even serving on your board of directors.

10. **Be authentic and transparent**: Be genuine and transparent in your communication with teens. Avoid using jargon or overly technical language, and be open to feedback and criticism. By being authentic and transparent, you'll build trust with teens and create a sense of community.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Remember to be flexible and open to feedback, and don't be afraid to try new things. Good luck!

TITLE: Me [43 M] with my new partner [37F] 3 weeks duration, first time trying to be intimate I had a failure to launch due to psychological block.

POST: So here is my issue. First some background, I am fairly recently divorced (1 year) coming out of a really bad marriage of 15 years. It was a bad breakup with lots of bitterness on both sides, add to that 2 kids who I now don't get to see as often as I would like. I went from that right into a horrible abusive relationship with a much younger woman (24 F) who essentially saw I was incredibly vulnerable and used me for financial gain while filling my head with how I was a really terrible person which is why I ended up divorced and that she didn't know why she stayed with me. The end result was any self esteem I had was ruined but I somehow got addicted to her. 

I finally left that relationship 3 months ago after I just couldn't take it anymore. I really worked to try and improve myself and have lost a bunch of weight and my general outlook on life has improved. I met a really nice woman a couple of weeks ago and we clicked. I really like her, she likes me and hey things seem to be looking up. 

So the problem, we decided to become intimate and things seemed to be going good but I couldn't get hard. I was into it, wanted it but it just wasn't happening. First time ever for me that this occurred. I have no problem getting an erection if I masturbate so it's not physical but psychological. I still have in my head the crap my ex gf used to tell me plus I guess lingering guilt over my divorce. So how do I overcome this, because I really want to develop this into a healthy relationship.

TL;DR: Recently divorced, got into a bad relationship, finally left, met new partner, first time trying to be intimate, had a failure to launch due to psychological block, seeking advice on how to overcome this.

POST: I'm a 17 year old female and he is a 21 year old male. We've been dating for about 4 months and we're madly in love with each other. He's never had a gf before me and i even took his virginity. We've never been apart for more than a day and when he mentioned the idea of him going to Austin, it kinda crushed me. I'm always telling him that he should hang out with his friends and i'm always supportive of whatever it is that he's doing so of course i acted like it was no big deal and i told him that i'm really excited for him and that he should definitely go. He could hear it in my voice that i was upset but i kept on denying it. 

HE'S ONLY GONNA BE GONE FOR 1 WEEKEND. Like i feel so dumb that i can't even handle 2-3 days without him. I feel so clingy and desperate. I trust him 100% but i DON'T trust the people that he's going with. One of the people going is his friend that i do not like at all. He's EXTREMELY rude to me almost every time he's comes over and he's rude to my sister and he's even a dick to my bf. He's vulgar and he's constantly getting sloppy drunk, and starting fights. He's a fucking cokehead for God's sake. 
And another person that's going is this girl that, for some reason, i have myself convinced she likes my bf. She's really flirty towards him and has pet names for him and everything. I don't trust her or anyone for that matter. 

I know all of them are just gonna be rude to him and take advantage of him while they're there but he doesn't see that. Ugh i feel so retarded.

Tell me i'm over reacting

TL;DR: 17 year old girl's 21 year old bf wants to go on a weekend trip without her and she's freaking out because she doesn't trust the people he's going with and feels like he's abandoning her.

ANALYSIS:

This post is an example of a common phenomenon in relationships: the fear of abandonment. The OP is feeling anxious and insecure about her partner's desire to take a weekend trip without her, and is projecting her own insecurities onto the situation. She is overthinking the situation and assuming that her partner is going to cheat on her or abandon her because of the people he is going with.

The OP's fears are fueled by her own insecurities and lack of trust in her partner's friends. She is also projecting her own feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem onto the situation, feeling like she is "clingy" and "desperate" for attention.

The post also highlights the importance of communication in relationships. The OP's partner should have had an open and honest conversation with her about his plans and reassured her of his commitment to their relationship. The OP should also have communicated her feelings and concerns to her partner in a non-accusatory and non-possessive way.

In conclusion, the OP's fears are unfounded and she should try to communicate her feelings to her partner in a healthy and constructive way. She should also work on building her own self-esteem and confidence, and not rely on her partner's attention to validate her worth.

TITLE: Should I encourage my boyfriend to exercise and eat better or is this his own issue to deal with?

POST: When I met my boyfriend almost two years ago, he was fit and in shape. We used to run together and go hiking all the time. He was stressed out for awhile and drank a lot, and six months ago he had to move away for a different job. His new location doesn't have nice places to exercise outdoors, and he hates exercising indoors. He has gained about 30lbs since I met him and I know it affects his self-esteem. He recently found out that he is "overweight" and he constantly calls himself fat. I tell him that I love him and that if he is unhappy with his body image, he should exercise. But, he always makes excuses. I wonder if I should encourage him more. Is this a good idea or should I let him deal with this issue on his own. I don't want him to take my encouragement as "I love you less because you're overweight." That's not the case. However, I do worry that if he continues to gain weight he could suffer health consequences since his family members have Type II Diabetes. I also just want him to feel better about himself. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Boyfriend gained 30lbs since we met, is unhappy with his body image, and makes excuses not to exercise. Should I encourage him more or let him deal with it on his own?

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I think you're doing the right thing by being supportive and loving. It's not your job to fix his issues, but it's okay to encourage him to take care of himself. Maybe instead of telling him to exercise, try asking him how he's feeling and what he thinks he needs to do to feel better about himself. Sometimes people respond better to gentle nudges than direct orders. Also, it's great that you're concerned about his health, but it's not your responsibility to fix his health issues. That's something he needs to take care of himself.

COMMENT 2:
I think you're being really thoughtful and caring by wanting to help your boyfriend. However, it's important to remember that you can't force someone to change their habits or take care of themselves. If he's not motivated to make changes, it's not your job to fix it. You can support him and be there for him, but ultimately, it's up to him to make the changes. Maybe you could have an open and honest conversation with him about how his weight gain is affecting you and how you're worried about his health, but also make it clear that you love him no matter what.

COMMENT 3:
I think you're being really sweet and caring, but also a bit controlling. You're not his personal trainer or nutritionist, and it's not your job to fix his issues.

TITLE: It pains me (22F) to see an ex (22M) of 3 years, in a relationship with someone else. How do I move forward?

POST: As mentioned in the title, I'm having trouble moving on from someone I dated 3 years ago. It's been a while, I'm in a good relationship now, yet one part or me can't shake this feeling of "what could have been?" With said ex. When I see him with someone else (online/school (we go to the same school)), I can't help but feel loss. 

I know my ex isn't right for me. I know I don't want him. Yet for some reason, I'm having trouble letting go of the last few feelings for him.

Fellow redditors and relationship gurus, can you give me any advice so I can help myself finally move forward and fully appreciate future relationships?

TL;DR: Ex of 3 years is in a relationship with someone else, and seeing him with someone else makes me feel loss and regret. How do I move on and fully appreciate future relationships?

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "It's normal to feel this way, but it's important to recognize that your ex is not the right person for you. You're in a good relationship now, and it's okay to acknowledge that. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship and the things that make you happy. It might also help to talk to your partner about how you're feeling and see if they can offer any support or guidance."
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings, but it's important to recognize that dwelling on the past can hold you back from moving forward. Try to focus on the present and future, and what you want to achieve in your current relationship. It might also help to set boundaries for yourself, such as avoiding social media or situations where you might see your ex. Remember that you deserve to be happy, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being."
3. **u/anonymous123456**: "I went through something similar, and it took me a while to realize that I was holding onto the past because I was afraid of the unknown. Try to focus on the present and what you have in your current relationship. It might also help to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop a plan to move forward. Remember that it's okay to take your time and focus on yourself, and that you deserve to be happy."

TITLE: Just broke up with my [20F] boyfriend [21M] of 2 years for what I think was a good reason, I feel so horrible and empty.

POST: My boyfriend,  well I guess ex bf and I dated for a bit over 2 years, during which we lived together. We were not perfect and had many problems but were committed to working it out. We did argue frequently but both knew that we loved each other. I don't know how it happened but over time, my romantic attraction towards him decreased to the point that it's pretty much non existent. 

He's my best friend. I love talking to him and being around him, but when it comes to sex or intimacy I just can't do it. I thought long and hard and chose to end the relationship half out of respect for him. I feel everyone deserves to be in a relationship where both parties want each other equally. I can't offer him that and want him to be happy in his future. As well although I know he was never mad about it. I was also feeling increasingly guilty over the lack of sex in our relationship because of me. 

To me these are all logical points ( correct me if I'm wrong),  but my emotions are getting the best of me. I wish I could change the way I feel. Now I just have this horrible void in me. He was such a big part of my life and I'm just hoping I made the right choice.. Please give advice/opinions, he's saying I just didn't try hard enough. I just want to lay in bed forever..

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years because I lost romantic attraction towards him. I feel guilty and empty. He says I didn't try hard enough. I'm questioning if I made the right choice.

TITLE: I fixed something! One stupid little thing that I broke to begin with is now working again.

POST: As the new admin of IT at my library, I inspire confidence in all the employees just by being here while they work on their computers. When anything electronic needs any kind of maintenance, repair, instillation, etc. *I ride down from Mt. Olympus and activate my powers of computing to quicken all the digital world.*

The only problem is that **I am shit with computers.** I have no idea how I got this job because most of you reading this probably know better how to use them than I do. I broke explorer by trying to install an update. *I'm that bad at it.* 

But I fumble through this and everyone cheers! "Great job, Crazybay. You are vital to our staff, CrazyBay." "Do you want another raise? No? How about we just buy you subway once a week, put you on salary, and pay your cell phone and internet bills?"

I recently screwed up one of my bosses computers pretty bad (it may have not actually been my fault but probably was). After a full weekend of stress and reading dozens of pages of stuff on support.microsoft.com, I not only unbroke it, but I also installed the ghetto new circulation system on her office computer!!

This shouldn't matter as much as it does to me but now I feel just the slightest bit validated in receiving the beef-up paycheck that came with the job.

TL;DR: I'm bad at computers, but I fixed something! And now I feel like I deserve my paycheck.

COMMENTS:

* "Congrats on fixing the circulation system! You're doing better than I thought you would"
* "I'm impressed you managed to fix it after breaking it in the first place"
* "I'm glad you're feeling validated, but don't get too cocky, you're still not the best at computers"
* "I'm sure your boss is thrilled to have you working on her computer, even if it was a bit of a struggle"
* "You're doing better than I thought you would, but don't get too comfortable, there's still a lot to learn"
* "I'm glad you're feeling confident, but don't forget to keep practicing and learning, you never know when you'll need to fix something else"
* "You're doing great, keep it up and you'll be a pro in no time"
* "I'm glad you're feeling validated, but don't let it go to your head, you're still a work in progress"
* "You're doing better than I thought you would, but don't get too comfortable, there's still a lot to learn and improve on"
* "I'm glad you're feeling confident, but don't forget to keep practicing and learning, you never know when you'll need to fix something else"

TITLE: Me [44 F] with my friend [44 F] 32 years, I lied to her 25 years ago and having anxiety about it now.

POST: She and I have been best friends since we were children and have been through a ton of shit together and are still best friends to this day. 

She liked a guy when we were 19 years old and they had slept together a couple of times.  He didn't want a relationship but she did, so she ended it but still had feelings for him.

I do not remember the time in between but he came on to me and I slept with him.  She had moved away by this time. Word traveled fast and she found out and confronted me on the phone.  She asked if it was just once and I said yes.  She asked if I was drunk and I said yes.  Both are not true.  It was twice and I wasn't drunk.  No excuses.  I broke the girl code.  I was so afraid of losing her that I thought this way she would know kind of what happened and I had a better chance of retaining the friendship.  I am honest when I say there was no maliciousness involved in not telling her.  Truth is, I was and may still be a coward. Come to find out years later I trickle truthed her. 

I have generalized anxiety.  For whatever reason lately, this incident is first and foremost in my head when the anxiety hits.  I keep thinking I should tell her but it may just be to assuage my own guilt and a way to reduce the emotional pain.  I have spoken to my psychologist about this and he said that it was so long ago and she knows the act that happened that there is no need to hurt her again unnecessarily.  He seems to think that my anxiety is looking for an outlet and has latched on to this event.  I honestly hadn't thought of the event in years.  So much has happened in both our lives (marriages, children, etc) that it seems like ancient history. I don't know what to do and would appreciate some outside perspective.  Thank you.

TL;DR: I lied to my best friend 25 years ago about sleeping with her ex. I'm now experiencing anxiety about it and wondering if I should confess. My psychologist says it's unnecessary and I'm just looking for an outlet. I value our friendship and don't want to hurt her again. What do you think? Should I tell her or keep it to myself? 

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, I think your psychologist is right. You've already hurt her once, and it's not like you're going to make it right by telling her now. It's been 25 years, and she's moved on with her life. You're not going to gain anything by confessing, and you might even lose the friendship. Just focus on moving forward and not dwelling on the past."
2. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I understand why you're feeling anxious, but I think your psychologist is right. You're not going to change the past by confessing, and it's not like you're going to make it right by telling her now. You've already hurt her once, and it's not like you can undo that. Just focus on being a good friend to her and moving forward."
3. **u/anonymous_user**: "I think you should tell her. You've been carrying this secret around for 25 years, and it's eating away at you. You deserve to be honest with yourself and with her. It might be uncomfortable, but it's the right thing to do. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might not want to be friends with you anymore."
4. **u/careful_critic**: "I think you should consider the potential consequences of telling her. You're not just hurting her again, you're also putting your friendship at risk. You've had 25 years of a good friendship, and it's worth considering whether it's worth risking that for your own guilt. Maybe you could try talking to her about something else that's bothering you, and see if that helps alleviate your anxiety."
5. **u/empathetic_ears**: "I can understand why you're feeling anxious about this. It's a heavy burden to carry around. I think you should talk to your psychologist again and see if there's a way to work through this together. Maybe there's a way to find closure or forgiveness without hurting your friend again. You deserve to find peace and move forward." 

**Note:** The comments are a mix of opinions, with some people advising to keep the secret and others suggesting that it's better to be honest and confess. Some comments also offer alternative solutions, such as talking to a therapist or finding a way to work through the anxiety without hurting the friend again. The post has received over 100 comments, with many people sharing their own experiences and perspectives on the situation. The OP has not yet responded to the comments, but it's likely that they will consider the different opinions and perspectives before making a decision. 

**Edit:** The OP has since responded to the comments, saying that they are still undecided and are considering the different opinions. They have also mentioned that they are going to talk to their psychologist again and seek their advice on the matter. The post has been updated with the OP's response, and the comments continue to pour in with advice and support. 

**Conclusion:** The post has sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many people sharing their own experiences and perspectives on the situation. The OP is still undecided, but the comments have provided a valuable perspective on the issue. Ultimately, the decision to confess or keep the secret is a personal one, and it's up to the OP to decide what is best for their friendship and their own well-being.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my boyfriend [21 M] and our 1 year anniversary fiasco

POST: To keep things short and sweet, we live about 2 hours from each other and today was our 1 year anniversary. I took off as did he and I made the trip last night to go visit him so we could celebrate our 1 year together. Today however, we did nothing but look for clothes for his new job as a server.

We woke up early and tried to make things snappy, as 4PM rolls around we're finally wrapping things up but we're both frustrated because we wanted to have a day together to do 1 year anniversary things (go to museums, get food, go see a movie). Due to it being such an ordeal going from shop to shop, mall to mall that by the end of it we didn't have time to do any of it because everything would be closed after we battled through city 5o'clock traffic. He had a melt-down because I wanted to go back home and sleep in my own bed because I was exhausted and I didn't see a point in staying if he had to work at 7AM the next day.

My question to you, reddit; Am I totally out of line for being upset that he didn't really take care of his commitments before hand or am I just a needy little bitch? Please help me understand his side because I so badly want to get over this but I just cant understand his train of thought when I stopped my multiple projects a day early so I could come on Wednesday night and not Thursday morning.

TL;DR: We had a 1 year anniversary fiasco because we spent the whole day shopping for his new job and didn't have time for any anniversary activities. I'm upset because I feel like he didn't prioritize our celebration and I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable or if he's just not caring.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a platform for individuals to share their personal experiences and receive feedback and support from others. The OP (original poster) is seeking to understand if they are being unreasonable in their expectations for their anniversary celebration and is looking for others to provide insight into their partner's perspective.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the events that transpired, making it easy for readers to follow along and understand the situation. The OP is also open about their own feelings and emotions, which helps to create a sense of empathy and understanding from the readers.

The comments section is filled with a variety of responses, ranging from those who agree with the OP's frustration to those who offer alternative perspectives and suggestions for improving communication. Some common themes that emerge include:

* The importance of communication and setting clear expectations for the anniversary celebration
* The need for compromise and flexibility in planning activities
* The potential for misunderstandings and miscommunications to arise when partners have different priorities and expectations

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide a supportive and constructive environment for individuals to share their experiences and receive feedback and guidance from others.

TITLE: 18 year old guy, first relationship. Please help.

POST: We split up in the middle of the summer because she was leaving for the semester, and she wasn't into me anymore (or so she claimed). We got back together at the end of the summer temporarily when our families stayed at the same hotel for a week during vacation.

She left for the semester, started hooking up with a douche who eventually cheated on her and got expelled. I made a terrible decision and hooked up with one of her friends and had a brief fling with another one. I was incredibly depressed and looking for someone to cling to for support. She had a brief fling with another guy and is currently pursuing a third. We talk a lot over email and chat, although it's mostly me who initiates contact. Towards the beginning of the semester I asked several times if she wanted to get back together and she said it was too early to tell. The last time, I pressed her for an answer (was a month or two ago), and she rejected me pretty brutally.

She came back for thanksgiving break and didn't particularly want to see me, although she wasn't totally opposed to it. She went to a random party and hooked up with several guys but apparently they weren't particularly desirable. She posted a bunch of shit on her tumblr about lost love and missing someone. She could mean me, or could mean the guy she's currently pursuing. I have no idea. She posted a picture with the caption: "You used to be alright. What happened?" and said "[name], lovie, this is for you."

Those are the facts and I have no idea what to make of them. I think she still has feelings for me, but is also angry/disgusted with my hooking up with her friends. I've apologized and explained myself to her, and I don't know how best to help the situation now.

I would really like to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know if that's possible or how best to go about doing that. My idea was to give her some space for a month (aka no contact) and seeing how she feels when she gets back. Am I an idiot? What should I be doing? I have no idea what to do. Please please help.

TL;DR: 18 year old guy, first relationship. We broke up, got back together temporarily, and then she left for the semester. She's been hooking up with other guys, and I've been depressed and made some bad decisions. She's still in touch with me, but rejected me when I asked to get back together. She's been posting cryptic messages on her tumblr and I'm not sure what to make of them. I want to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know how to do that. Help.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you need to take a step back and focus on yourself. You've been making some pretty poor decisions, and it's not healthy to be constantly reaching out to someone who's clearly not interested in you right now. Give her space, and focus on becoming the best version of yourself. When she gets back, you can re-evaluate the situation and see if you're ready to move forward with her or not."
2. **u/itsjustmeagain**: "I think you're reading way too much into her tumblr posts. She's probably just posting about her feelings and experiences, and it doesn't necessarily mean she's thinking about you. You need to stop obsessing over her and focus on your own life. You're 18, you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't waste it on someone who's not interested in you."
3. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're being too passive aggressive by giving her space for a month. Instead, try to focus on becoming a better person and doing things that make you happy. When she gets back, you can have a real conversation with her about your feelings and see if there's a chance for you two to work things out. But don't do it out of desperation or expectation - do it because you're genuinely interested in her and willing to work on your relationship."
4. **u/sad_panda**: "I feel for you, dude. It sounds like you're going through a tough time. But you need to remember that you're not the only one who's made mistakes. Everyone does. The important thing is that you're acknowledging your mistakes and trying to learn from them. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the positive things in your life. You got this." 

---

**Subreddit's Response:** The subreddit community is divided on the best course of action for the OP.

TITLE: I [17f] cannot figure if crush [19m] is interested in me or just bored. How can I ask?

POST: So I've been chatting on fb almost weekly for substantial periods of time (20 min - 1 hr) with a boy who graduated from my school last year for almost a year now and I can't tell if he actually enjoys our conversations or feels obligated to respond and wishes I would leave him alone. I've been able to see him in person a couple of times since he left for college (once when I visited his city and asked and once when he came back and said he'd try to see me, which he did.) over Christmas break I tried to see him and he was busy (legitimately so, I believe, but there was no mention of trying another time) and when I messaged him he took much longer than usual to reply so I decided not to try contacting him in case he was trying to get rid of me (I almost always start the conversation.) A little over two weeks later, he messaged me and we talked for about an hour. I messaged him about a week after to say our school had posted a baby photo of him (he's the son of two teachers, that's why it was posted) and we talked for a while. There wasn't a clear ending to the conversation as we seemed to miss when the other was online but we were having a good conversation when he just stopped responding. It's been three days and he hasn't even read the message. 

I can't figure out what's going on here. Does he actually want to be friends or does he just like talking to me when he's bored or am
I the annoying girl who can't take a hint? Can I ask about it? I'm worried to say anything because it'll probably come off as needy (and maybe it is) and I'll look extremely insecure but at the same time I'm tired of constantly wondering about this. I hate that I get worked up waiting for him to reply and I'd just like to know what he's thinking so I know if it's even worth it to continue making an effort to be friends. 

What should I do? Is there any eloquent way to approach this or should I just let it be?

TL;DR: I've been chatting with a guy for almost a year, but I'm unsure if he's genuinely interested in me or just bored. I've tried to see him in person a few times, but he's always busy or takes a long time to reply. I'm worried about being the annoying girl who can't take a hint, but I'm tired of constantly wondering about his intentions. Should I ask him about it or just let it be?

**Community Response:**

* Many users suggest being direct and honest about your concerns, but also being respectful of his feelings and boundaries.
* Some users recommend taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship, considering whether it's worth the emotional investment.
* Others suggest paying attention to his body language and tone in conversations, as these can often reveal more about his interest than his words.
* A few users advise against asking him directly, as this could come across as needy or clingy, and instead suggest focusing on building a stronger connection with others.
* One user suggests sending a casual, lighthearted message asking if he's busy or if there's something going on, which could help gauge his interest without being too direct.

**Example Responses:**

* "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversations. I've been feeling a bit unsure about where we stand and if you're genuinely interested in talking to me or if you're just doing it out of obligation. I value our chats and would love to continue them, but I also don't want to be the annoying girl who can't take a hint. Can we talk about this?"
* "I've been thinking a lot about our conversations and I'm starting to feel like I'm putting in a lot of effort and not getting much back. I'm wondering if you're just doing this out of boredom or if you're actually interested in getting to know me better. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this."
* "I've noticed that you've been taking a while to reply to my messages lately, and I'm starting to feel like you're not really interested in talking to me. I understand that life gets busy, but I'd love to know if there's something going on that's making it hard for you to respond. Can we chat about this?"

**Key Takeaways:**

* Be direct and honest about your concerns, but also be respectful of his feelings and boundaries.
* Pay attention to his body language and tone in conversations, as these can often reveal more about his interest than his words.
* Consider taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship, considering whether it's worth the emotional investment.
* Don't be afraid to prioritize your own emotional well-being and focus on building a stronger connection with others.

TITLE: F/20 Should I be worried about our future together?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for six months and we're planning on living together this coming fall. He and I won't see each other during the summer months since we'll be in different states working, and we'll move in together right when he gets back. I am one hundred percent ready to make this leap with him, but what makes me hesitate is that he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves, and that he feels more fulfilled when he is alone because he is more productive. This brought on the topic that he thinks that living together like this will either solidify our relationship or end it. I think it's a bit strange to bring this up while still planning on moving in together... Our relationship has been a bit rocky because of the lack of productivity together. When we're together, we just want to BE together: not be bothered by friends, school, etc. Just be in each others company. This has made both of our grades suffer, and friendships. Which has soured the relationship. We both said that when we look back on our history together, it's been great but not as great as it could be because of how little we have actually done. I am just worried that this isn't the right step to take in our relationship if he feels so rocky about it, and if our relationship is based off of a history of non-productivity. 
Have any of you been in this situation? And what did you do to fix it? Or can it be fixed?

TL;DR: F/20, boyfriend and I are planning to move in together in the fall, but he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves and that he feels more fulfilled when alone. He thinks living together will either solidify or end our relationship. I'm worried about the future and if our relationship is based on non-productivity.

**Annotated Response**

The OP (original poster) is concerned about the future of her relationship with her boyfriend, who has expressed doubts about his love for her and feels more fulfilled when alone. She is worried that their relationship is based on non-productivity and that living together might not be the right step.

**Concerns and Questions**

1. The OP is worried about the uncertainty of her boyfriend's feelings and whether he is truly committed to their relationship.
2. She is concerned that their relationship is based on a history of non-productivity and that living together might exacerbate this issue.
3. The OP is unsure if their relationship can be fixed or if it is doomed to fail.

**Potential Solutions**

1. The OP could have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her concerns and feelings.
2. She could suggest setting boundaries and goals for their relationship, such as prioritizing productivity and individual pursuits.
3. The OP could consider seeking counseling or therapy to work through their issues and improve communication.

**Red Flags**

1. The boyfriend's admission that his love for the OP comes and goes in waves may indicate a lack of emotional stability or commitment.
2. His preference for being alone and feeling more fulfilled when single may suggest that he is not ready for a long-term commitment.
3. The OP's concerns about the non-productivity of their relationship and the potential impact on their future together may indicate a lack of compatibility or shared goals.

**Takeaway**

The OP's situation highlights the importance of open communication and mutual understanding in a relationship. It is crucial for the couple to address their concerns and work together to find a solution that works for both of them. If the boyfriend's doubts and preferences are not addressed, it may indicate a lack of commitment or compatibility, which could ultimately lead to the demise of the relationship.

TITLE: [21m/22f] Dating for 18 months, no plans for the future...?

POST: Hi /relationships, this is my first post. I read the rules, but please let me know if I missed anything :)

So I've been dating this wonderful girl for about a year and a half now. She absolutely adores me, would do anything for me, and I would do the same for her. We're both college grads and live near each other in a bigger city. 

But as much as I enjoy our relationship and feel devoted to her, when I look to future I can't see us together. Whenever I think about moving in together, or even getting engaged, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't picture marrying her. I can't picture marrying anyone right now.

I think what we have is just a "comfortable" relationship. But when do I need to either commit to the next step or break it off? She was looking at apartments online the other day and started using words like "we" when describing moving into them. We had a talk about how I wasn't ready for anything a few months ago and she seemed to be on the same page, but lately she's been hinting at the long-term kind of things, and says her family is asking her about me and our plans as well.

TL;DR: Been dating for 18 months, no plans for the future, feeling stuck and unsure about what to do. Should I commit to the next step or break it off?

---

This post is a great example of a common dilemma in relationships: the uncertainty and discomfort that can come with thinking about the future. The OP (original poster) is feeling stuck and unsure about what to do, and is seeking advice from the r/relationships community.

The post is well-written and provides a good amount of context, including the length of the relationship, the OP's feelings about the future, and the hints from his girlfriend about moving forward. The OP is also honest about his own reservations and feelings, which makes it easier for readers to understand his perspective.

Some potential responses to this post might include:

* "Have you talked to your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns? It's possible that she's feeling uncertain or anxious about the future as well, and a conversation could help clear the air."
* "It's okay to take your time and not have all the answers. You don't have to rush into anything that makes you uncomfortable. Maybe take some time to reflect on what you want and need from your relationship."
* "If you're feeling stuck, it might be helpful to try to identify what specifically is causing your discomfort. Is it the idea of marriage, moving in together, or something else? Once you can pinpoint the source of your anxiety, you might be able to address it and feel more confident in your relationship."

Overall, this post is a great example of a relatable and common relationship dilemma, and the responses could provide valuable advice and support for the OP.

TITLE: TIFU by calling out a line cutter

POST: I was at a grocery store last night, picking some stuff up for a date, and I got in line at the express counter, but a man came over and stood in front of me. At first I thought I'd let it go, but then decided to say something, so I said something alone the lines of "hey, um, sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I was standing right there when you came over and got in line..."

And he let me go in front of him, at first apologizing but then said "it's not a big deal, you don't have to have a cow about it."

First of all, WTF is this, 1998? Second, I wasn't having a cow, I was trying to be as polite as possible in letting him know he'd cut me in line. So now I am a little agitated, and said "well you don't just cut people in line!" and we got into an argument about whether he knew what he was doing. He said "fuuuuck yoouuu" and I said "fuck you too," and he flew off the handle, started calling me a bitch over and over as I was paying for my stuff. It was really, really terrible and I was badly shaken by the end of it.

I know I wasn't nice, it was a bad idea to engage after he made that "have a cow" comment, should've given him the benefit of the doubt when he said he didn't see me, and I really didn't need to return the f-bomb he hurled at me. Should've just let it go.

TL;DR: I called out a line cutter at a grocery store, and it escalated into a huge argument and ended with me being called a bitch by a stranger.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a relatable and embarrassing experience of standing up for themselves in a situation, only to have it backfire and escalate into a confrontation. The post is a cautionary tale about the importance of staying calm and not engaging with aggressive or rude individuals.

The OP's initial intention was to politely point out that the man had cut in line, but the situation quickly spiraled out of control. The man's response, "it's not a big deal, you don't have to have a cow about it," was perceived as dismissive and condescending, leading the OP to feel agitated and defensive.

The OP's decision to engage with the man and return the f-bomb he hurled at them was a mistake, as it only fueled the argument and made the situation worse. The post serves as a reminder to stay calm and composed in the face of adversity, even when someone is being rude or aggressive.

The comments on the post are filled with people sharing their own similar experiences and offering words of encouragement and advice. Many commenters agree that the OP did the right thing by standing up for themselves, but also acknowledge that they should have handled the situation better. The post has received over 1,000 comments and has been upvoted over 10,000 times, making it one of the most popular posts on the r/tifu subreddit.

TITLE: I[m19] want to know best way to not get boring to a girl [f22] who I kinda have a thing with

POST: So im starting to get to know this girl[f22] better and I[m19] want to make sure I dont get boring, it has happened to me before.  We just spent 2 weeks together at a spring class thing that was in the mountains.  There was about 10 of us that built a pretty tight nit group but me and her hit it off real well.

Since we were with each other basically 24/7 for two weeks, we didnt have to text to talk(could just talk in person) or have to plan to hangout, it just happened but now that were back home I want the "thing" to go somewhere but im afraid I will get boring.

What do you all think i should do to not get boring and to get this to go somewhere.  Oh and one more thing, she does have a slight concern that where to far apart in age but she doesn't consider is a huge deal and she seems to be interested in taking it further as well.

TL;DR: I[m19] want to know best way to not get boring to a girl[f22] who I kinda have a thing with. We spent 2 weeks together in the mountains and now I want to take it further but im afraid I will get boring.

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're 19 and she's 22, that's not a huge age gap. Focus on building a connection with her, not trying to impress her with grand gestures. Just be yourself, be genuine, and show her that you're interested in getting to know her better. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. And honestly, if she's worried about the age gap, it's probably because she's trying to find a reason to not pursue things with you. So, just be yourself and see where things go."
2. **u/DatingCoach99**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself, have fun, and see where things go. Don't try to plan out every move or worry about being boring. If she's interested in you, she'll find ways to keep the conversation going and have fun with you. And if she's not, then maybe she's not the right person for you. Remember, it's okay to be yourself and not try to be someone you're not. Authenticity is key in any relationship."
3. **u/Redditor12345**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax, be yourself, and have fun. Don't try to plan out every move or worry about being boring. If she's interested in you, she'll find ways to keep the conversation going and have fun with you. And if she's not, then maybe she's not the right person for you. Remember, it's okay to be yourself and not try to be someone you're not. Authenticity is key in any relationship."

TITLE: My boyfriend [18M] is very angry at me [18F] because I don't like jewelry.

POST: We have been together over two years, but got in a very large fight today. We have large fights occasionally where my boyfriend just gets blinded by his anger. 

I have never ever liked jewelry, and haven't worn a single item of jewelry since elementary school, my ears aren't even pierced. Even with this fact, my boyfriend continues to buy me jewelry.

I haven't been rude about it up until this point, because you shouldn't ever really refuse a gift. But I do make a point to him that I don't like jewelry, and never wear it, while trying to be as polite as possible. For some reason, he can't understand this about me and continues to get angry that he buys me jewelry I don't wear, etc. etc. He just seems to not understand I don't want this type of typically "nice" gift. I still thank him for the original intent, but at what point should he start treating me as a person with individual likes and dislikes? He just expects me to like typical "girl"  things. He's very upset with me and calling me ungrateful. Sigh. Maybe he's right. It's just something I will never be able to like but am expected to be grateful for anyway :/ 

Also, I would understand if we just started dating, but it's been two and a half years of this. I don't want to lie to him about my interests though.

He is also trying to break up with me right now....but he does that every time he gets angry.

TL;DR: Boyfriend gets angry because I don't like jewelry, even though I've told him multiple times. He thinks I'm ungrateful and is trying to break up with me. I feel like he's not respecting my individuality and likes/dislikes.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that you're being honest with him about your feelings. It's not fair to expect someone to like something just because it's 'typically' liked by women. You should be proud of yourself for being true to yourself!"
* "I'm so tired of people expecting women to like certain things just because of their gender. You do you, girl! If you don't like jewelry, that's okay. It's not a reflection of your worth as a person."
* "I think it's time for him to take a step back and reflect on why he's so upset. Is it really about the jewelry, or is it about feeling like he's not being heard or understood? Maybe he needs to work on his communication skills."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like he's not respecting your boundaries or individuality. You deserve better than someone who gets angry and tries to break up with you over something as trivial as jewelry."
* "I think it's time for you to take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If he's not willing to listen to you and respect your feelings, then maybe it's time to move on."

**Top-level comments:**

* "I think you should have a calm conversation with him about how his expectations are affecting you. Maybe he's not even aware of how he's coming across."
* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like he's not respecting your autonomy and individuality. You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are, jewelry preferences and all."
* "I think it's time for him to take responsibility for his own feelings and reactions. If he's getting angry over something as trivial as jewelry, then maybe he's not emotionally mature enough for a healthy relationship."

TITLE: F[19] Met a very nice guy, but he is leaving very soon!

POST: Basically, I've recently met this very nice boy that I instantaneously fell head over heals for. He's very sweet and I feel that he is perfect match for me and he feels the same! We've only known each other for a month and we are both 19.

Unfortunately... we're both young and in college and he is moving back in with his parents for the entire summer, starting on the 21st or so. So we'll be roughly 4 hours apart for around 4 months.

My question is, what should I do now? At this point I feel like I'm falling harder and harder for him, but I'm afraid that I'll be really sad and lonely when he leaves. Should I stop seeing him until he gets back? Or should we keep in touch? Help me not be irrational, because if he asked me to be in a long distance relationship with him, I might consider it.

TL;DR: Met a great guy, but he's leaving for the summer and I'm worried about the distance. Should I stop seeing him until he gets back or keep in touch?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's great that you're thinking about this before getting too deep. It's normal to feel attached, but it's also important to consider the logistics of a long distance relationship. If you're not comfortable with the distance, it might be best to take a break until he gets back. You can always re-evaluate your feelings then. Don't be afraid to communicate with him about your concerns!"
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. It's not fair to assume he's not thinking about the distance either. Maybe you can come up with a plan to stay in touch during the summer, like regular video calls or visits. It's not ideal, but it's better than just cutting things off."
3. **dating_expert**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's great that you're thinking critically about this. If you're not comfortable with the distance, it's okay to take a break. You can always re-evaluate your feelings when he gets back. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Don't feel pressured to stay in a relationship that's not working for you."
4. **long_distance_lady**: "I've been in long distance relationships before, and it's not impossible. If you're both committed to making it work, you can make it through the summer. Just make sure you're both on the same page and have a plan in place for staying in touch. It's not ideal, but it's not the end of the world either."
5. **rational_rachel**: "I think you should focus on the present moment and enjoy the time you have with him before he leaves. You can always re-evaluate your feelings when he gets back. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to make a decision right now. Just take things one day at a time and see how things go."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [19 M] of 2 months and am having second thoughts about it

POST: I've been dating my boyfriend for two months now. We started dating a month after we started talking, and at the beginning it was rough because it was summer after college and we were both home, not being able to see each other for a few months. After coming back for school (a few weeks now), I realized that being together isn't all that great. I feel like we having nothing to talk about, differences in humor, he's prone to "teasing me" (makes jokes about acne, weight, etc.) that became increasingly irritating. I don't actually feel like I like him emotionally, but since I've never been in a relationship before, I can't tell if this is just me being too picky and having high expectations. Should I break it off, or is 2 months of dating too short to really know if I "like" someone? I mean, when we're being nice and actually talking and laughing, I feel great, but other time, I have to constantly ask myself if I'm actually enjoying the relationship or just wasting my time.

TL;DR: 2-month relationship, feeling like we have nothing to talk about, differences in humor, and boyfriend's teasing is becoming increasingly irritating. Should I break it off or give it more time?

RESPONSES:

* "Honestly, 2 months is a decent amount of time to get a feel for someone. If you're feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really connecting, it might be time to reevaluate. Don't worry about being too picky or having high expectations - you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship. Take some time to think about what you want and what you're looking for, and have an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. Two months is a short amount of time, and it's normal to have ups and downs in any relationship. Instead of focusing on the negative, try to think about the positive things about your relationship. What do you like about your boyfriend? What do you enjoy doing together? Focus on building those things and see if you can work through the issues you're having. And remember, relationships take work and communication - don't be afraid to have tough conversations with your partner."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship and what your dealbreakers are. If you're feeling like you're just tolerating your boyfriend's behavior and not actually enjoying the relationship, it might be time to reevaluate. Don't feel pressured to stay in a relationship just because you don't want to be single or because you think you should be grateful for the attention. Your happiness and well-being are more important than any relationship."
* "I think you're being too quick to dismiss the relationship. Two months is a short amount of time, and it's normal to have some growing pains. Instead of focusing on the negative, try to think about what you can do to improve the relationship. Are there things you can do to connect with your boyfriend on a deeper level? Are there things you can do to make the relationship more enjoyable for both of you? Don't give up on the relationship just yet - take some time to think about what you can do to make it work."

TITLE: I 29F am feeling very insecure about my 32M boyfriend 3 years because he had cheated on me in the past. I need some tips and advice.

POST: Parker and I have been together for 3 years. Very very early on he cheated, and we went to couples counseling because he was very determined to make me feel important and make the relationship work. It ended up helping a lot and we have a good relationship.

But there is that just nag in the back of my head that I am so insecure. I am open with him about being insecure at time but he just says I need to not worry about things, and that he has done what he can to help me with my insecurity but he doesn't know what else to do and it is up to me to get over my insecurites. Which I get that, he said it from a place of love and I wasn't upset.

Every relationship I have ever been in I have been cheated on. Which sucks, and it sucks that it happened with Parker but I am just a little screwed up from being cheated on so much.

I want this to work with Parker, and I trust him but sometimes I just feel so insecure. Last night a pretty girl at the bar we were at who he is friends with came up and started talking to him and it was harmless and whatever but on the inside I just felt so insecure.

I have a great career and a good life and yada yada. I just don't even know what to do. I know I will kill the relationship if I continue on like this. 

Help :(

TL;DR: I'm 29F and my 32M boyfriend cheated on me 3 years ago. I've been open about my insecurities, but he says I need to get over them. I'm worried I'll ruin the relationship if I don't work on my trust issues. Help!

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're still struggling with trust issues after being cheated on multiple times. It's not just about Parker, it's about the trauma and pain you've experienced in the past. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your insecurities and wanting to work on them. Have you considered couples therapy again? It might be helpful to work through these issues together. Also, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the efforts Parker has made to make it work. Remember that it's okay to take things slow and work on your trust issues at your own pace."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not fair that you've been cheated on multiple times. I think it's great that you're open with Parker about your insecurities, but it's also important to remember that you can't control how others behave. You can only control how you react to it. Have you considered setting boundaries with Parker? For example, you could ask him to be more open with you about his interactions with other women. It might help you feel more secure in the relationship. Also, try to focus on the present moment and not dwell on the past. You deserve to be happy and loved, and it sounds like Parker is trying to make it work."
3. **u/cheatersaretheworst**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not fair that you've been cheated on multiple times. I think it's great that you're open with Parker about your insecurities, but it's also important to remember that you deserve better than someone who cheats. If Parker is truly committed to making it work, he should be willing to work with you to overcome your trust issues. Have you considered taking a break from the relationship to focus on yourself and your own healing? It might be helpful to take some time to reflect on what you want and need in a relationship. Remember that you deserve to be loved and respected, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness."

You can only control how you react to the situation. Have you considered setting boundaries with Parker?

TITLE: I [19 M] have been with my girlfriend [19 F] for 2 years. She just told me that she was not a virgin the first time we had sex a year ago. Am I crazy for feeling betrayed and wanting to end the relationship?

POST: To preface, I was really open about sex in the beginning of the relationship. I told her that while I do not mind if she had done it with anybody before, she should let me know as I had never done it with anyone before her. I also made it very clear that I wanted to give up my first time with somebody special, and a year into the relationship, I decided she was the one. I had 3 fairly serious girlfriends before her, but I never got to the point where I wanted them to be my first. 

I honestly feel a little sick looking back on our relationship now. She would joke about how she took my v card and how I took hers. She always said how she was happy I was her first. I feel really betrayed that she could lie to me so easily for so long in the relationship. I believe this is the end of the relationship. 

Am I crazy for feeling so betrayed? I'm talking to my girlfriend tomorrow to likely end the relationship.

TL;DR: Girlfriend told me she wasn't a virgin when we had sex a year ago, despite saying she was. I feel betrayed and want to end the relationship.

COMMENT 1:
You're not crazy for feeling betrayed. You had a right to know the truth about her past, especially since you were being open about your own. It's not like she was hiding a secret that would ruin your life, but rather a secret that could have changed the dynamics of your relationship. You're not overreacting, you're just feeling hurt and betrayed. Take the time to process your emotions and have a calm conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling.

COMMENT 2:
I think you're being a bit dramatic. It's not like she lied about something major or hurt you physically. It's just a little white lie. You're not going to find someone who is a virgin, and it's not like it's a deal-breaker. You're just mad because you feel like you got played. Take a step back and think about how you're going to approach this conversation. You're going to come across as petty and immature if you just end the relationship without talking it out.

COMMENT 3:
I agree with comment 1. You had a right to know the truth about her past, especially since you were being open about your own. It's not about being a virgin or not, it's about the principle of honesty. If she can lie about something like that, what else is she lying about? You deserve better than someone who can't be honest with you. Don't settle for someone who is willing to deceive you. You're better off without her.

COMMENT 4:
I think you're being a bit too harsh. Maybe she didn't think it was a big deal, or maybe she was trying to spare your feelings. You can't just assume the worst about someone without giving them a chance to explain themselves. Have a calm conversation with her and try to understand her perspective. Maybe there's more to the story than you're aware of. Don't make a decision based on emotions alone. Take the time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to work through.

COMMENT 5:
I'm with comment 2. You're not going to find someone who is a virgin, and it's not like it's a deal-breaker. You're just mad because you feel like you got played. Take a step back and think about how you're going to approach this conversation. You're going to come across as petty and immature if you just end the relationship without talking it out. Maybe you can work through this and come out stronger on the other side. Don't be so quick to write off the relationship just because of one little secret. 

The comments on this post show a range of opinions on the situation. Some people agree with the OP that he has a right to know the truth about his girlfriend's past and that her lying is a betrayal. Others think that the OP is being too harsh and that the situation is not as big of a deal as he's making it out to be. Some people suggest that the OP should try to have a calm conversation with his girlfriend and work through the issue, while others think that the relationship is probably over and that the OP should move on. The comments also highlight the complexity of relationships and the importance of communication and trust. 

The post itself is a good example of how relationships can be complicated and how people can have different expectations and values. The OP's girlfriend may not have seen her past as a big deal, but the OP did, and her lying about it has caused him to feel betrayed and hurt. The situation also raises questions about what is important in a relationship and how people should communicate with each other. 

Overall, the post and the comments provide a nuanced and thought-provoking discussion about relationships and the importance of honesty and communication.

TITLE: What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about?

POST: I'm having a bit of a crisis right now and I need some perspective. I recently lied to my partner about something pretty minor, but it's been eating away at me ever since. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever lied about something ridiculous and what the consequences were.

TL;DR: I lied to my partner about something minor and it's been bothering me. Has anyone else ever lied about something ridiculous and what happened?

COMMENT 1:
I once lied to my best friend about eating the last slice of pizza. I told her I didn't eat it, but really I did. She was really upset and we had a big fight. Looking back, it was a stupid lie and I should have just owned up to it. But at the time, I was trying to avoid a confrontation.

TITLE: TIFU by trying a social experiment

POST: to start off and give context I work got a seasonal job at a big amusement park chain of which I wont name for privacy purposes. as an employee we get free tickets and passes. one of the rules that come along with them are that we are only allowed to give them away and not sell them. well on Facebook i tried to see how many people who i don't regularly talk to would suddenly want to be my best friend when i offered to sell these passes at a discount rate. after a few hours of it being up and getting the results i was expecting i deleted the post. 

today i was called into the security office of my job and they interviewed me in a small room for about a 1/2 hour before telling me that i was suspended and would be under investigation. kept my cool because i did nothing wrong and never actually sold them but still it means less hours this week and a smaller pay check

TL;DR: tried a social experiment on Facebook by offering to sell free amusement park passes at a discount rate, got suspended from my job for it

This post is an example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a story about a mistake they made and the consequences that followed. In this case, the author tried a social experiment on Facebook by offering to sell free amusement park passes at a discount rate, which led to them getting suspended from their job.

TITLE: Is hypnosis as  learning possible?

POST: I've happened to see/read a lot about hypnotists being able to "instruct" people to do things while in some form of a hypnotic state (like the classic sleeper agent spy who will perform an act when his hypnotic state is activated). There have been plenty of movies and entertainment TV shows that showcase this, including one I saw a while back that purported to show that it was possible and effected. There's also the use of hypnosis as for drug/alcohol/mental status therapy that has plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this.

However my question revolves around whether students could be hypnotized and taught material as is in a normal class and usefully retain that information when not in a hypnotic state? I'm a college student and (no surprise here) the idea occurred to me while cramming for an exam.

TL;DR: Can students be hypnotized and taught material in a normal class setting, and retain that information when not in a hypnotic state?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: I'm a hypnotist and I can tell you that it's definitely possible to teach students material while they're in a hypnotic state. However, it's not as simple as just waving a watch in front of their eyes and telling them to learn. You need to establish a strong rapport with the student, and the material needs to be presented in a way that's engaging and meaningful to them. Additionally, the student needs to be highly suggestible, which not everyone is.
2. **SkepticalStudent**: I'm a college student and I've taken a course on hypnosis. While it's true that hypnosis can be used to enhance learning, it's not a magic bullet. The material still needs to be presented in a way that's engaging and meaningful to the student, and the student still needs to be motivated to learn. Additionally, hypnosis is not a substitute for actual effort and practice.
3. **HypnotistHank**: I've used hypnosis to teach students material in a classroom setting, and it's been incredibly effective. However, it's important to note that hypnosis is not a substitute for traditional teaching methods. It's best used as a supplement to enhance learning, rather than a replacement for it.
4. **ScienceNerd**: There's actually some research on this topic. Studies have shown that hypnosis can improve memory and learning, but it's not a magic solution. The material still needs to be presented in a way that's engaging and meaningful to the student, and the student still needs to be motivated to learn.
5. **throwaway123456**: I've used hypnosis to teach students material in a classroom setting, and it's been incredibly effective. However, it's important to note that hypnosis is not a substitute for traditional teaching methods. It's best used as a supplement to enhance learning, rather than a replacement for it.

**Conclusion:**

The comments from the hypnotists and experts in the field suggest that hypnosis can be used to enhance learning, but it's not a magic solution. The material still needs to be presented in a way that's engaging and meaningful to the student, and the student still needs to be motivated to learn. Additionally, hypnosis is not a substitute for traditional teaching methods, but rather a supplement to enhance learning. The students who are most likely to benefit from hypnosis are those who are highly suggestible and motivated to learn. Overall, hypnosis can be a useful tool for learning, but it's not a magic bullet that can replace traditional teaching methods.

TITLE: Me[20M] and my girlfriend [21F] of 9 months tells me she does not want me in her life seemingly out of the blue.

POST: A little background.  We have been dating for almost 9 months and have had ups and downs with stresses of attending school and both doing hard science majors.  

Basically she claims that I only do nice things for her when something is going wrong and that when she does nice things (like a small note) I don't say anything.  We have had arguments of this before and it had seemingly been resolved.

Now that it is the summer and she is back home with her family about 5 hours away from me.  I visited about 3 weeks ago and we had an amazing time.  We both wish we could have spent the whole summer together.  

Last week she was agitated with her family, specifically her dad and brothers and I had spent a lot of time talking to her about her frustration.  She said she did not feel like she was loved enough.  So for the last week or so I have been trying to do nice things for her here and there because of this (like sending a handwritten card, and flowers).  As this has been happening she seems to be getting more distant with me.  I try and get at what is really bothering her and she is does not give me a straightforward answer. 

Then last night she just goes off on me late at night.  Saying I am not good enough for her and that I am a self centered a-hole.  Telling me to f off and she doesn't need me.  Just continues to say all of these extremely hurtful things to me.  I didn't try and reason with her much, just told her that whether you ever believe me or not I care for you deeply (and things along those lines).

It seems like she is taking all of her anger out on me from other things going on in her life and I do not understand how to respond.  Should I try and talk to her or just leave her alone for while?  I am at a loss of what to do because it seems like it is coming out of nowhere.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 9 months tells me she doesn't want me in her life after I've been trying to do nice things for her due to her frustration with her family. She says I'm not good enough for her and I'm self-centered. I'm unsure of how to respond.

TITLE: TIFU by studying for finals

POST: This happened yesterday, after a 6 long day marathon of studying for three finals that are right after each other, I was ready to begin my winter break. I called up my uncle to pick me up and two hours later he finally showed. He asked me to drive since I know my way around my campus more so I did. Little did I know, 12 cans of Monster, 4 hours of sleep and the adrenaline pumping through my veins because of the excitement of winter break would impair my driving skills. As I pulled out of the parking space, I drove directly into a cement pillar causing $3000 worth of damage to the front of my car. I didn't even get out of fucking parking garage. I had to use my shoe strings to keep the bumper from falling off and hitting the front wheel. On the bright side, I got high marks this quarter.

TL;DR: Studied for 6 hours, got 4 hours of sleep, drove into a cement pillar, and got high marks.

TITLE: I [25F] wasn't invited to birthday gathering of 5 months [25M]

POST: Hi, my feelings are a little hurt and I think this is a sign I should end this situation with a guy I'm seeing but I need some help in organizing my thoughts.

I seen this guy about 1-3 times a week for the past 5 months and we communicate every single day. Last week I started getting weird vibes from him (he doesn't cuddle with me as much and looks at his phone more). After I left his apartment, he hasn't tried to initiate any conversation for about 5 days. His birthday was coming up and he was inviting his friends to hang out (both female and male) and did not invite me. I messaged him the day of his birthday  to congratulate and asked if he was doing anything. He explained again he's going to hang out with his friends, but made no mentioning that he wanted me there. He also later in the night hung out with coworkers as well to celebrate.

In the past I've planned things for us and asked myself to hang out with him but generally if he's already out with people and I ask to join,  he has a reason I shouldn't be there. He takes a lot of initiate so I think he just didn't want me there at his birthday.

I feel like if I express my feelings I will seem needy. He's not my boyfriend. I feel like I don't seem important enough in his life to want me there to celebrate for him.

I would like to continue to be his friend, but how do I express that I get the sense he doesn't like me as much anymore and it's better to end it now and the lack of invitation was a sign he didn't want me there?

TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing for 5 months didn't invite me to his birthday gathering, didn't initiate conversation for 5 days, and has been distant lately. I feel like I'm not important enough to him and I don't want to be in a situation where I'm not valued. How do I express my feelings without seeming needy?

1. **u/throwaway123456**: OP, it sounds like you're already feeling pretty hurt and unsure about the situation.

If you do decide to have a conversation with him, try to focus on your own feelings and experiences rather than accusing him of not valuing you. You can say something like, "Hey, I've noticed that we haven't been spending as much time together lately, and I feel like I'm not a priority for you. I was really hurt when you didn't invite me to your birthday party, and it made me feel like I'm not important to you. I want to be honest with you - I'm not feeling valued in this relationship, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing." Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness.

TITLE: Getting mixed signals from a girl I'm interested in [21/m][25/f]

POST: I went out to a bar last night with a coworker, her boyfriend, and her cousin. The night started off okay, me and the cousin where chatting and getting along pretty well. Then her 'ex' (they talked for a while but he told her he wasn't looking for anything serious) showed up and they spent a while talking to each other. He eventually left and I ignored her for a while (I mean c'mon she shunned me for an ex). Next thing I know she grabs my hand and we are alone outside the bar making out (I assumed it was a "I hate me ex I'll just make out with you" type thing, but she is cute and I had a few drinks in me so I went with it).

After the kissing ended I mentioned her ex and she apologized profusely and said she had no idea he was going to be there and she just isn't sure how to act around him yet. She said it's totally over between them. We talk about how we both are looking for a real relationship and we are definitely interested in getting to know each other more. We exchange numbers and make plans to see each other today, but nothing was set in concrete. My coworker asks me today what I thought of her, I said she's pretty cool and ask if she said anything about me, apparently "i'm a good kisser". 

So I call her this afternoon and ask about a time to hang out, she says she is going to lunch with a friend and will get in touch afterwards and let me know a good time (I was at work till later the evening anyway). She then texts me a few hours later saying she forgot she had plans with a friend and she is free tomorrow if we want to get together then. Now I have become pretty jaded with dating and the opposite sex in general, so I immediately doubted her "prior plans". Not too mention I'm not the most confident person in the world so I immediately assume that she's blowing me off. 

Am I over thinking things? Do I have legitimate concerns? I'm definitely interested in this girl and I want things to work, but I don't want to waste my time either.

TL;DR: Got mixed signals from a girl I'm interested in. We made out, talked about wanting a real relationship, exchanged numbers, but now she's giving me vague answers and I'm doubting her intentions.

* "I'd say it's a bit of both. You're right to be cautious, but you're also overthinking things. Just have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and see how she responds. That's the only way to really know what's going on." (u/dating_advice_guru)

TITLE: I (24, female) found out that my boyfriend (23, male) responded to a male seeking male casual encounters ad on Craigslist while out of town. Advice needed!

POST: Background info: He and I have been dating for a little over 6 months. Basically fell head over heels, and moved in quickly together. We had plans to move to a new city in August where I will be starting my first year in law school. We have an apartment reserved and everything is taken care of. I have never had any suspicions and he treats me better than anyone I've ever been with. He makes me feel beautiful and worthy of companionship. 

A couple of weeks ago he was sent out of state on a short 5 day business trip. He works for a retail company and was helping to set up a new store. 

Since his return, he's just been a little off. I felt horrible (and still do) but I did something shitty and went through his phone. 

Found out he had responded to a man looking for man casual encounters ad on craigslist. His email sounded very comfortable, as he knew the acronyms and typical format. He sent it the day he got out of town. The man responded 3 days later, to which my boyfriend offered to host. There is no other communication that I could find.

When I confronted him, he said that he has no idea why he even responded to the ad. He said he didn't want to actually meet up, but had the urge to talk to someone online only. He claims that what I have read is the only communication he had and that he has never physically cheated on me. He also said that this is the only instance where he was interested in talking to a man sexually. 

I have no idea what to do. I love and care about him deeply and I have never connected so easily with anyone. I do not know what to believe and whether what he is saying is bullshit.

TL;DR: Boyfriend responded to a male seeking male casual encounters ad on Craigslist while out of town, claims he didn't want to meet up and only wanted online conversation. I'm torn between believing him and feeling betrayed.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

1. **Don't rush to judgment**: Take some time to process your emotions and think about the situation objectively. Consider the possibility that your boyfriend might be telling the truth.
2. **Have an open and honest conversation**: Talk to your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Make sure you both understand each other's perspectives and boundaries.
3. **Evaluate the evidence**: While it's understandable that you felt the need to snoop, consider the fact that there's no other evidence of physical cheating. Your boyfriend's words might be the only truth you have to work with.
4. **Consider counseling**: Infidelity is a serious issue, and it's essential to address it in a healthy and constructive way. Consider seeking the help of a couples therapist to work through your feelings and rebuild trust.
5. **Reflect on your own feelings**: Take time to understand why you're feeling so hurt and betrayed. Is it because you feel insecure about your relationship or because you genuinely believe your boyfriend is lying?
6. **Don't make assumptions**: Don't assume that your boyfriend is lying or that he's not telling the truth. Give him the benefit of the doubt and try to understand his perspective.
7. **Communicate your boundaries**: Make it clear to your boyfriend what you're comfortable with and what you're not. Set boundaries and expectations for your relationship moving forward.
8. **Take care of yourself**: Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and honesty in a relationship. Take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally, during this challenging time.

Remember, relationships are about growth, communication, and trust. It's essential to address the issue and work together to rebuild trust and strengthen your bond. Good luck!

TITLE: My boyfriend M(22), and I F(21) have been dating for 3.5 years but I suffer from an anxiety disorder and this has given him severe performance anxiety. How can we stop the positive feedback loop?

POST: I suffer from an anxiety disorder, which has recently gotten much worse with both of our college graduations coming up, my classes being very work heavy and fear that I might be doing poorly at work. Because of this, I burst into tears when he is unable to become erect (which used to only happen rarely when he was too tired but now it happens every time). He told me he becomes incredibly anxious when we are about to become intimate because he really wants to perform well and he really really does not want to make me cry but this makes it impossible for him to become erect, then I cry... 

Yes, I have really tried very hard to be supportive and pretend like it doesn't bother me but that is really difficult (and frankly, I am a terrible liar). Especially when he can hear me sobbing in the other room afterwards. I cannot stop it from happening! I try to hide the crying from him but I know he knows, and that makes him anxious which makes him unable to perform next time.

How can we stop this positive feedback loop and have stress free, enjoyable sex again?

TL;DR: My boyfriend has severe performance anxiety due to my anxiety disorder, which causes me to cry when he can't perform. This creates a positive feedback loop of anxiety and stress. How can we break this cycle and have enjoyable sex again?

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Have you considered couples therapy? A professional can help you both work through your anxieties and develop healthier communication and intimacy habits. It's not uncommon for anxiety disorders to affect relationships, and a therapist can provide guidance on how to navigate these challenges."
2. **u/relationshipcoach**: "It's great that you're acknowledging the impact your anxiety is having on your relationship. One strategy you could try is to focus on intimacy and connection outside of sex. Hold hands, give each other massages, or simply cuddle. This can help you both feel more connected and relaxed, which may reduce performance anxiety."
3. **u/anxietywarrior**: "I'm so sorry you're going through this. As someone who also struggles with anxiety, I can attest that it's not easy to overcome. Have you considered talking to your doctor about medication or therapy to help manage your anxiety? Sometimes, having a better handle on your anxiety can help reduce the impact it has on your relationship."
4. **u/sextherapist**: "It's great that you're willing to work on this together. One thing you could try is to have an open and honest conversation about your anxiety and how it's affecting your relationship. Let your boyfriend know that you're not trying to shame or criticize him, but that you want to work together to find a solution. You could also try experimenting with different sexual activities or positions that might help reduce performance anxiety."
5. **u/relationship_advice**: "It's great that you're acknowledging the impact your anxiety is having on your relationship. One thing you could try is to focus on building intimacy and connection outside of sex. This can help you both feel more connected and relaxed, which may reduce performance anxiety. You could also try talking to your doctor about medication or therapy to help manage your anxiety."

TITLE: 22 and whining about parents... (ranting ahead)

POST: I spent four years living half a country away from my parents, and those four years were great, but expensive. So when my parents moved closer to me, I moved in with them, looking to save money and finish school. 

It's been going pretty well. I go to church with them once a week (they're fundamentalist Christians), I don't drink or go to parties and I work to pay for school. They cover my room and board, and occasionally drive me around. 

Last week however, I had a friend come up from Toronto, (about an hour and a half away.) I went to a movie with said friend (Magic Mike) and told my parents I was going to see Abe Lincoln. Ignoring the fact that it's not as terrible as it sounds, that I'm 22 and lying to my parents, my mother somehow found out. 

Now she's all cold and "I'm too angry, we'll talk about it later" and I want to be like "no! We're not going to talk about it later. We're not going to talk about it ever, because it's none of your business." I appreciate what they've done for me, and they've been a huge help, especially in the last few months, but sometimes I want to tell them that parts of my life have nothing to do with them. 

I'm tired of not dating because they won't approve of the guys I date and sick of listening to her every single week, "will you be in heaven with us?"

TL;DR: I'm 22, living with my parents, and I'm tired of them controlling my life. I want to be able to make my own decisions and live my own life without them constantly judging me.

TITLE: What's your, "Everything happens for a reason" story?

POST: My story:

I was not the most hardworking kid in highschool and therefore found it extremely difficult to find scholarships or grant money for when i actually started going to college.

In November 2011, I moved in with my grandparents. Almost immediately, i got a job in order to pay for my college expenses. At the time my grandparents were having an incredibly hard time supporting themselves, let alone me. I had been basically fiscally abandoned by my parents with little to no money, to my name. Anyways my grandparents were beginning to think about filing for bankruptcy. My grandfather was on his way home from work one day early in October (2012), fell asleep at the wheel and was killed in the resulting car crash. His life insurance settlement paid off for nearly 500k. My grandfather whom i loved with all my heart, wanted nothing more than to see me get a college education. Now just shortly after 7 months later, I'm graduating with my associate's degree with a 4.0. Hopefully in another few years, i'll be on my way to being a surgeon, and making enough money to take care of my grandmother, who has helped take care of me.

TL;DR: My grandfather's death led to a life insurance settlement that paid off my college expenses, allowing me to pursue my education and eventually make a better life for myself and my grandmother.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

1. "That's an incredible story. I'm so sorry for your loss, but I'm glad that your grandfather's passing led to a positive outcome for you. You're an inspiration to many people, including me."

TITLE: Is the extra attention you're getting actually slowing down your progress?

POST: Hi all! I'm 25/m 5'8", been dieting and exercising for about 12 weeks now. Dropped about 20 pounds, starting at 240 and currently standing at 218 this morning. When I started, I stayed away from a lot of social gatherings and just focused on my program. Well honestly I was just a bit self-conscious about how much I gained. I also have a skin condition on my face that causes rashes to break out a lot. Anyway, I skipped out on a lot of birthdays, graduations, etc. Around week 8 I felt confident enough to start going out again, the diet has pretty much eased the rashes on my face and I'm more clear than I have been in awhile. My friends noticed my weight loss immediately. These days I'm starting to attend more gatherings and kind of regretting it, haha. I find it hard to stay away from all the drinks and snacks that come along with it. From starting at a pace of 2-5 pounds lost every week, I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully I haven't gained.

TL;DR: I was doing great on my diet and exercise, but since I started going out more and getting attention for my weight loss, I've plateaued. I'm wondering if the extra attention is actually slowing me down.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP! Congrats on your weight loss so far! It's awesome that you're feeling more confident and comfortable in your own skin. I think it's normal to feel like you're being pulled in different directions, especially when you're getting attention for your progress. It's like, you're trying to stay focused on your goals, but also enjoy the fruits of your labor, you know?

I think it's worth considering that maybe you're not as focused on your diet and exercise as you were when you were staying away from social gatherings. Don't get me wrong, it's great that you're enjoying yourself and having fun, but maybe try to find a balance between that and staying on track with your goals. You can still have fun and be social without completely derailing your progress. Maybe try to set some small goals for yourself, like "I'll have one drink and stick to my healthy snacks" or something like that. That way you can still enjoy yourself and not feel like you're missing out.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been there too, where I felt like I was getting too much attention and it was affecting my progress. For me, it was social media. I would post my progress and get all these comments and messages, and it would make me feel like I was getting too much attention. So, I took a step back and stopped posting as much. It wasn't easy, but it helped me stay focused on my goals.

I think what you're experiencing is similar. You're getting attention for your weight loss, and it's making you feel like you're getting too much attention. Maybe try to take a step back and focus on your goals again. Don't get me wrong, it's great that you're getting attention and recognition for your hard work, but maybe try to find ways to stay focused on your goals without letting the attention get to your head.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not going to lose weight forever, and it's normal to have ups and downs. You've already lost 20 pounds, which is amazing! Don't beat yourself up over a plateau. Instead, try to focus on the progress you've made so far and the fact that you're still making healthy choices. You're not going to lose weight if you're not eating healthy and exercising regularly, so keep doing what you're doing and don't worry too much about the scale.

Also, I think it's great that you're getting attention for your weight loss. It's a great motivator, and it shows that all your hard work is paying off. Just try to stay focused on your goals and don't let the attention get to your head. You're doing great, OP! Keep it up!

TITLE: How do I get a solid response from a girl I've asked out 3 times and gotten an iffy response in return, but I KNOW is interested in me?

POST: I met this girl on Okcupid. We hit it off and after a few messages I asked her out to dinner in which she replied "I'm really busy for the next couple weeks, but I'll see what I can do". I figure she's letting me down nicely and never expect to hear from her again.

Four days later she messages me back with her number! Word. We text back and forth a few times over the next few days and I ask her out one more time and I get the same sort of response. However, I figure she's being honest because she not only gave me her number in the first place, but has talked about sex, that she wanted to teach me how to dance, and all this other stuff that proved she was really interested. If anything, the fact she keeps responding to me, someone she's never even met, tells me she's being honest.

So after this, I go on vacation to Florida where I am currently (it's been almost two weeks). I asked her if she was busy next week again, but made a rookie mistake, gave her another thread at the same time, and she latched onto that instead of the real inquiry I was interested in. Oh well. A few days later (about 3 or 4 days ago) I ask her again and she replies "I'll see what I can do :)".

So here I am today. I get back on Friday. I've been talking to this girl somewhat for roughly 3 weeks. What do I say to get her to commit to a date on Saturday? If she gives me another iffy response should I keep trying MORE? I mean as long as she's responding, she's clearly interested right? I just don't want to come off as pathetic seeing as this is like the 4th time I've asked her out.

TL;DR: Girl I've been talking to on Okcupid keeps giving me iffy responses when I ask her out. I know she's interested because she's given me her number, talked about sex, and all that jazz. How do I get her to commit to a date on Saturday? Should I keep trying if she gives me another iffy response?

---

**Top comments:**

* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be honest and tell her you're excited to see her and would love to make plans for Saturday. Don't make it a big deal, just a casual ask. If she says no, then she's not interested and you can move on."
* "I agree with the above comment. You're making it too complicated. Just ask her out and be clear about your intentions. If she's interested, she'll say yes. If not, then you can move on."
* "I think you're reading too much into her responses. 'I'll see what I can do' is a pretty standard response when someone is busy. It doesn't necessarily mean she's not interested. Just ask her out again and see what happens."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your approach. You're coming on too strong and it's probably scaring her off. Try to take it slow and build a connection with her before asking her out again."
* "I think you should just be yourself and not overthink it. If she's interested, she'll let you know. If not, then you can move on. Don't make it a big deal, just a casual ask."

**Subreddit discussion:**

The post has received over 200 comments, with many users offering advice and sharing their own experiences. Some users are more optimistic, suggesting that the girl is interested and just needs a little nudge to commit to a date. Others are more skeptical, warning that the girl may be playing hard to get or simply not interested.

The discussion is lively and engaging, with many users sharing their own stories of asking people out and getting iffy responses. Some users offer more specific advice, such as suggesting that the OP should try to find out what's going on in the girl's life that's making her busy, or that he should try to build a connection with her before asking her out again.

Overall, the subreddit community is supportive and helpful, offering a range of perspectives and advice to help the OP navigate his situation.

TITLE: TIFU By Texting My Sister.

POST: This happened last Friday night, but the consequences didn't fall upon my person until today.

Bit of a back story for relevance - I am temporarily living with my Mother again and she stared dating this guy, we'll call him "Stew". Stew is a major doucher and uses her, then makes her feel like shit, when I come home from work I have to deal with it. They've been on and off dating for 5 months now.

So last Friday night Stew and my Mother have another falling out, where my Mother comes home all upset because he is being a major asshole again. After she settles down and goes to bed, I text my sister about it. I wax poetic of how much of a prick Stew is and how I am tired of having to run damage control.

Just as I send it, I realize that instead of starting a new conversation with my sister, I actually responded to an old group text my Mother sent to me, my sister and... Stew.

The next day when I come home from work my Mother says she was pretty pissed at me, at first, but then realized I was right and told Stew this was wake up call for both of them. From the way she put it, it was implied everything was fine and they even made plans to go out of town next weekend.

So today I come home from work and my Mother is in tears, informing me Stew just broke up with her, and he used my text message as an excuse. She then goes on to tell me she'd rather be treated like shit then be alone.

Now my whole family hates me.

TL;DR: I texted my sister about my Mother's boyfriend being a jerk, but accidentally sent it to the group chat with him in it. Now my Mother is in tears and my whole family hates me.

TITLE: What to consider when preparing a roadtrip from SoCal to NorCal?

POST: My spring break started yesterday and I am planning to go from Southern California to Northern California stopping at various universities along the way.  I'm coming from Los Angeles and will be stopping at UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, and finally stopping at UC Davis.  I am planning on going the entire week so I will seperate out the car trips, so it would be 4 hours each trip to each location.

I have taken into consideration food and gas fees.  Was wondering if I would need to know the location of hospitals and emergency rooms just in case.

This is my first time planning such a trip and I will be going alone.  I also need help convincing my parents to let me do this.  What should I tell them?  I am 19 and consider myself responsible.  They used to be very leniant but have recently cut back due to increasing stories of teenagers getting in car accidents in my area.

TL;DR: Planning a road trip from SoCal to NorCal, stopping at universities along the way. Need advice on what to consider, especially with hospitals and emergency rooms, and help convincing my parents to let me go.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'd recommend downloading a mapping app like Waze or Google Maps that can help you navigate and find the nearest hospitals and emergency rooms along your route. It's also a good idea to keep a basic first aid kit in your car, just in case. As for convincing your parents, you could try framing it as a learning experience - you'll be able to see different parts of the state, meet new people, and develop your independence. Emphasize that you'll be responsible and take necessary precautions to stay safe. Good luck!"
2. **u/socalnative**: "I'd say the biggest concern is the weather. Check the forecast before you leave and be prepared for any unexpected changes. Also, make sure you have a reliable car and a full tank of gas before you start your trip. As for hospitals, you can use online directories like Healthgrades or Yelp to find the nearest ones along your route. And don't forget to take breaks and stretch your legs every few hours to avoid fatigue. Good luck on your trip!"
3. **u/UCBerkeleyAlum**: "Hey OP, I'm a Berkeley alum and I've taken that drive many times. The most important thing is to stay focused on the road and avoid distractions. You can also use the university's websites to find the best places to eat and hang out around each campus. As for convincing your parents, you could try showing them your itinerary and explaining how you'll be staying safe. You could also offer to keep them updated on your location and plans throughout the trip. Good luck, and have a great time on your trip!"
4. **u/roadtrippin**: "OP, I'd recommend taking the 101 freeway instead of the 5. It's a more scenic route and you'll get to see some beautiful coastal views. Also, make sure you have a good playlist or podcast to keep you entertained during the long drives. As for hospitals, you can use online directories like Google Maps or Yelp to find the nearest ones along your route. And don't forget to take breaks and stretch your legs every few hours to avoid fatigue. Good luck on your trip!"
5. **u/UCDavisStudent**: "Hey OP, I'm a Davis student and I've taken that drive many times. The most important thing is to stay focused on the road and avoid distractions. You can also use the university's website to find the best places to eat and hang out around campus. As for convincing your parents, you could try showing them your itinerary and explaining how you'll be staying safe.

I'm really excited for this trip and I'm glad I could get some advice from people who have taken this drive before. I'll make sure to stay focused on the road and avoid distractions. And thank you again for all your help and support!"

TITLE: TIFU by texting my mom a pornhub video link

POST: Alright, so I couple days ago i was browsing the hubs, if you know what I mean, on my phone. To be honest, I was in the mood for a quick boosh before I hopped in the shower. I was looking for videos to go along with my boosh and I noticed the video would not play. I copied the video link to try it in a few different browsers.

Fast forward to today, My dad and I have been looking for a car to purchase. We both went to look at one today and both my mom and aunt wanted to know what it was like. I texted my aunt first, explaining how it went. This is where the fuck up is. After i sent the message to my aunt, i tried to copy it so i can send it to my mom too since i'm too lazy to type one seperate for her. You can probably guess what went wrong. IT DIDN'T FUCKIN' COPY. I go to my mom and I's text conversation and I paste the pornhub video link (when i thought it would be what i sent to my aunt) and hit send immediately after i paste it. Lo and behold, I send a pornhub link to my mom.

I started to panic, not that i would be embarrassed or anything, but it is my mom i sent it to. That is a little weird. After i sent the link, i simply texted "Woops, meant to send something else" and then I pasted what was meant to be sent in the first place. She didn't say anything about the pornhub link, so I think she was completely oblivious to it. I haven't spoken to her in person yet, hopefully i got away with it.

TL;DR: I accidentally sent a pornhub video link to my mom while trying to copy a text to send to her. I quickly sent a follow-up text with the correct message and hope she didn't notice.

TITLE: My GF [26 F] wants me [26 M] to back out of lease with my BFF [27 F]

POST: I've been dating my girlfriend for two and a half years. I've recently had to move because I'm attending a graduate school partly because I wanted to remain close to her. The graduate school I got into was also the same graduate school my best friend who is a girl is also attending. This year I was trying to save money by living with a roommate and I thought my best friend would be great since we have spent alot of time and know each others habits. Originally my girlfriend gave the OK to live with my best friend, but now with two weeks before me and the best friend were supposed to move in we get into a huge argument and she says she doesn't want me to move in with my undergrad best friend. I don't want to back out because I gave my best friend my word and I feel like a jerk backing out in the last minute, but if I do live with her I know my girlfriend is going to resent me for the rest of the year.

TL;DR: My girlfriend wants me to back out of living with my best friend, but I feel like a jerk for doing so and I don't want to hurt my best friend.

* "I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about why she's having second thoughts. Is there something specific that's making her uncomfortable about you living with your best friend? Maybe there's a misunderstanding that can be cleared up."
* "I'd say you should prioritize your relationship with your girlfriend. If she's really uncomfortable with you living with your best friend, maybe it's better to find a new roommate or even consider moving in with her. You don't want to start the year off on the wrong foot with your girlfriend."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You gave your best friend your word, and now you're feeling guilty for not wanting to back out. But what about your girlfriend's feelings? You need to think about what's best for your relationship and your girlfriend's comfort level. Maybe you can find a compromise, like having a 'girlfriend's night' once a week or something."
* "I think you should talk to your best friend about this too. Maybe she's not as invested in the living situation as you think she is, and she might be willing to back out or find a new roommate. You don't want to hurt your best friend, but you also don't want to hurt your girlfriend."
* "I think you're being too focused on what's 'fair' and not thinking about what's best for your relationship. If your girlfriend is really uncomfortable with you living with your best friend, maybe it's better to prioritize your relationship and find a new living arrangement. You can always make new friends in graduate school, but you can't always fix a strained relationship."

TITLE: Credit cards and Credit History. Is it safe to close old accounts?

POST: Hello!

I hope that someone can lend me some advice for a situation that I find myself in. Here's my situation:

About 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.

Now, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.

Recently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.

Now my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.

Will closing this account greatly affect my credit score?

I even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...

Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I have an old AMEX Delta card with a paid off balance, and I want to close it and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card. I'm concerned about how this will affect my credit score. Will closing this account greatly affect my credit score?

**Top comments:**

1. **CreditKarma**: "Closing an old account can potentially affect your credit utilization ratio, which is the percentage of available credit being used. If you have other credit accounts with balances, it's generally recommended to keep your oldest account open to maintain a longer credit history. However, if you're not using the account and don't plan to use it in the future, it's not the end of the world to close it. Just make sure to pay off any remaining balance and keep the account in good standing before closing it."
2. **FinancialFreedom**: "I would recommend keeping the account open and using it sparingly to maintain a longer credit history. Closing an old account can negatively impact your credit score, especially if you have a limited credit history. Additionally, you may want to consider downgrading to a no-annual-fee card instead of closing the account altogether."
3. **CreditSavvy**: "It's generally recommended to keep old accounts open and in good standing to maintain a longer credit history. Closing an old account can negatively impact your credit score, especially if you have a limited credit history. However, if you're not using the account and don't plan to use it in the future, it's not the end of the world to close it. Just make sure to pay off any remaining balance and keep the account in good standing before closing it."
4. **CreditWise**: "I would recommend keeping the account open and using it sparingly to maintain a longer credit history.

Additionally, you may want to consider downgrading to a no-annual-fee card instead of closing the account altogether."

**Conclusion:**

The top comments from the subreddit provide a mix of opinions on whether it's safe to close an old credit card account. Some users recommend keeping the account open to maintain a longer credit history, while others suggest that closing the account won't have a significant impact on credit score. Ultimately, the decision to close the account depends on individual circumstances and credit goals. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons and consider factors such as credit utilization ratio, credit history, and credit score before making a decision. The user may want to consider downgrading to a no-annual-fee card or keeping the account open and using it sparingly to maintain a longer credit history.

TITLE: Landlord sold property - New landlord trying to increase rent during lease period.

POST: My fiance signed a lease with three friends last year, that started June 1st, 2014 (through May 31st 2015).  A month before that time, after being diagnosed with cancer, the landlord sold all his properties to a rental company.  The new company stated at that time that they'd honor all the old landlord's leases.

Fast forward to today, October 1st.  In this college city, leases that start on June 1st get signed in October for the previous year.  My fiance and her roommates intend on renting the property again (June 1st 2015 through May 31st 2016).  However, the rental company not only wants them to sign the lease for the next year, but sign one of their leases that superseeds the current one.  This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that they are also trying to raise the rent on the *current* lease by $30 per month.

My understanding is that a lease can't be altered by either party unless it is mutually agreed upon.  I don't know if that's the case if the property is sold, however.  Anyone have experience with this?

TL;DR: New landlord trying to increase rent on current lease, which was signed before they took over.  Is this legal?

TITLE: "Getting back out there" sucks.

POST: It's been two months since I (29m) broke up with my ex (23f). Since I have done a lot to improve myself. I doubled down on my schooling, lost 27 pounds, and have been doing more things that I enjoy. 

The issue is my breakup was amicable. We were just two people going separate ways. While it was mutually agreed upon the pain has still been pretty raw until recently. I now feel like I am in the position to start dating again! That's a pretty big step for me the only problem is I'm only meeting two types of women. The first group are women who aren't looking for anything at all besides friendship. That I am totally cool with but having the door open for a possible relationship would be nice. The other type is what gets me. The type of woman who wants to be in a relationship NOW, wants kids NOW, and wants it all delivered to her by a charming prince on horseback. The worst part is that this has happened a couple times in the last week and a half! 

It just seems like I can't find a happy middle ground. I really don't want to rush into anything and sitting around talking about some girls' guy troubles gets old quick when you have your own problems.

TL;DR: I'm trying to get back out there after a two-month breakup. I'm meeting women who either want friendship or want a serious relationship ASAP. I'm looking for someone who is open to getting to know me and seeing where things go.

This post is a great example of how people can struggle to navigate the dating world after a breakup. The author is trying to get back out there, but he's finding it difficult to find someone who is on the same page as him.

The author's frustration is understandable. He's been working on himself and is ready to start dating again, but he's finding it hard to find someone who is willing to take things slow and get to know him.

This post highlights the challenges of dating after a breakup, and the importance of finding someone who is on the same page as you.

TITLE: Fiancee [30F] wants an expensive wedding. How can I [30M] talk her down without looking cheap?

POST: My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a "$60k wedding" and "the groom/his family" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.

We can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.

The problem is that I don't want to just say "no" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.

What can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated

TL;DR: Fiancee wants a $60k wedding, but I think it's too expensive. How can I talk her down without looking cheap?

**Top comments:**

* "Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Explain your financial goals and how the wedding expenses will impact your ability to achieve them. Be specific about the numbers and how you plan to allocate your resources. It's okay to say no to a certain aspect of the wedding, but be willing to compromise and find a middle ground."
* "I think it's great that you're considering your financial goals and wanting to have a responsible conversation with your partner. However, it's also important to remember that this is a special day for her and her family. You could try to find ways to make the wedding more meaningful and personal, rather than just focusing on the cost. For example, you could incorporate cultural traditions or personal touches that are important to her."
* "I think it's important to remember that you're not just paying for the wedding, you're also paying for the memories and experiences that come with it. While $60k may seem like a lot, it's also a one-time event that you'll both remember for the rest of your lives. You could try to find ways to make the wedding more meaningful and special, rather than just focusing on the cost."

TITLE: Me [35 M] dating [36 F] for several weeks, she said "I'm too available"

POST: I recently started dating this woman, or rather started dating this woman again. I asked her out three years ago and we went on a few dates, and we didn't click. We remained friends, and we recently both found ourselves single. So, she asked me out to rekindle what we had going before. 

What attracted her to me was how much I had changed. Three years ago I was really immature with no real direction in life. Now, seven months after a devastating break up, I completely turned my life around. I've lost over 50 pounds. I'm exercising, eating clean and all around taking care of myself. Life is going awesome for me now.

So, she's back in the picture. Things are going really great between us. I'm trying new things with her that I haven't done with other women. I used to be a somewhat cold, cerebral person and not very affectionate. Now, I'm taking chances. I'm not overanalyzing and looking for "signs". I got handsy on her on our second date, I took a chance and kissed her. These things would take months in previous relationships. 

I've also decided to be more communicative. She likes to text, so I've reciprocated by texting her quite a bit. I've never been really chatty on text, but again, why not, I'm going to text as the mood strikes me, rather than again overanalyzing. We'll probably send each other like ten texts a day, although I find myself texting her more.

She gave some feedback to me which has got me thinking. She said that I'm too available. I'm not much of a challenge. Now I'm getting back into overanalysis mode. I sense I might be beginning to turn her off. How can I adjust my communication pattern with her to not be so "available" and be more "challenging"?

I'm a person who goes all out in self-improvement and my work, where my enthusiasm has brought tremendous results, but I'm sensing this might not be the best approach for relationships.

TL;DR: I'm dating a woman who said I'm too available. I'm trying to adjust my communication pattern to be more challenging, but I'm worried I might be overthinking it.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think she's just trying to say you're too eager. Maybe try taking a step back and not being so quick to respond to her texts. See if she initiates the conversation more often."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I agree with throwaway123456. It's not about being 'available' or 'challenging', it's about finding a balance. You're putting too much effort into the relationship too soon. Give her space and let her come to you sometimes."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're overthinking this. She said you're too available, not that you're too enthusiastic. Maybe she just wants to feel like she's the one initiating things. Try not to overanalyze and just be yourself."
4. **RelationshipCoach**: "I'd say it's a mix of both. You're being too available, but also too eager. Try to find a balance between being interested and being available. And don't overthink it, just be yourself and see how things develop."
5. **throwaway789**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and enjoy the ride. If it's meant to be, it'll work out. Don't worry too much about being 'available' or 'challenging'."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is worried about being too available in his relationship and is seeking advice on how to adjust his communication pattern to be more challenging. The comments suggest that he should try to find a balance between being enthusiastic and giving her space, not overanalyzing, and being himself. Some commenters also suggest that she might just want to feel like she's the one initiating things, so he should try to give her that space. Overall, the advice is to relax and enjoy the ride, and not put too much pressure on himself.

TITLE: I wish I could tell her.

POST: It's really kind of ridiculous. We'd been friends for so long, and when feelings started developing, I wasn't really surprised. I told her how I felt and she said it was the same for her, so we became a couple and it was really great. She was the first I'd been with that really supported me in my decisions, and I supported her in hers. 

When she left, it was so sudden I was really taken aback. She only ever said anything doubting us months beforehand, and when I asked to try and talk it out and help her feel better about it, she shrugged it off. I told her I would do anything to help make things the way she wanted them, but she said everything was alright, and for a while it was. 

We still talk sometimes, but god, every time I'm screaming in my head wondering what I did wrong. It's not even that I feel the need to be with her again, because I feel like it's important for us to find out the kind of person we want to be with and she decided I wasn't it. It's rough, but that's her decision. 

I just want to know why she chose to end it when it seemed so great. Now we just stay quiet and pretend it never happened, which is the worst part because we used to be so open with each other, well before we ever had any romance. Now that old friendship is gone.

TL;DR: I wish I could tell her why I'm still hurting from our breakup, but I'm too scared of hurting her again.

---

This post is a great example of the "off my chest" subreddit, where people can share their deepest thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. The author is struggling to come to terms with the sudden end of their relationship and the loss of their friendship. They're torn between wanting to understand why their partner left and not wanting to reopen old wounds.

The post is relatable because it's a common experience to feel stuck in the aftermath of a breakup, unsure of how to move forward or why things didn't work out. The author's fear of hurting their partner again is also a valid concern, as it's natural to worry about causing pain to someone you care about.

The post also highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. The author's partner's sudden departure and lack of explanation have left them feeling confused and hurt. If the partner had been more open and honest about their feelings and concerns, it might have helped the author to process their emotions and move forward in a healthier way.

Overall, this post is a great example of the value of sharing our emotions and experiences with others, even if it's difficult or uncomfortable. By doing so, we can gain a better understanding of ourselves and others, and potentially find closure and healing.

TITLE: Reddit, I'm think that my friend is taking advantage of my goodwill.

POST: ( *My mom came to me today with this question. I told her reddit might help her out. This is what she typed:* )

I have a friend through theatre, that I help regularly with designing lights, set, and directing for a very small amount of money (stipend).  She is a high school theatre teacher who doesn't know much about technical theatre, so I have helped rescue some of her shows, that were pretty bad.  The principal has even told the teacher how impressed he is with my work (I get program credit for designs).  I love what I do, and I don't mind helping the program and her.  

The most recent show is a large scale musical, that requires hundreds of hours of research and construction, with lights and set.  **She is asking me for my sketches and other materials to put up in her classroom to "teach" her class how it is done.**  She likes to come in to the shop and try to change things.  

First of all there is no time, because she waits till the last minute to do everything.  

Secondly, she doesn't know what she's talking about.  

I feel like my methods (along with creativity) of designing are part of why my designs stand out.  I don't really want to share all of my research material with her because:                              

**1.** I worked really hard getting my degree in design and graduated with honors, and I don't feel responsible for teaching her how to do her job better. 

**2.** If I give her my info she will most likely come into the shop more often telling me how to do my job, wasting more time that I never have. 

What do I do without jeopardizing the relationship?

TL;DR: Friend asks me to share my design materials and methods to "teach" her class, but I feel like she's taking advantage of my goodwill and doesn't appreciate my work.

**Reddit, what do I do?**

**Top comments:**

* "You're not obligated to share your work or methods with anyone, let alone someone who's not even paying you. You're doing this as a favor, and it's okay to set boundaries."
* "I'd say it's time to re-evaluate the relationship. If she's not respecting your time and expertise, it's not a healthy dynamic."
* "Maybe you could offer to give her a general overview of your design process, but not share specific details or materials. That way, you're still helping her out, but not giving away your secrets."
* "Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. It's possible she doesn't realize how her requests are coming across, and a clear conversation can clear the air."
* "You're not responsible for teaching her how to do her job. You're a volunteer, and your time is valuable. Set boundaries and prioritize your own needs."

**This post has received over 1,000 comments and has been upvoted over 10,000 times.** The community is divided on whether the OP should share their design materials and methods with their friend, with some arguing that it's okay to help out a friend in need, while others believe that the OP has every right to set boundaries and prioritize their own needs.

TITLE: I (22/f) am crazy about my boyfriend (27/m), but we haven't been dating long. Should I wait to tell my family how close we are?

POST: Reddit, I am so insanely, head over heels in love with my boyfriend, J. 

Humble bragging about us: We met when I moved to a new area for my job in July/August. We had been really great friends for months and ended up getting together on Valentine's day. We got very serious very quickly and have spent nearly everyday together since (admittedly, it's a little bit much but it's the honeymoon phase and we can't get enough of each other).  I don't think I could have dreamt of a better match for me. J's brilliant, creative, confident and unbelievably kind. His humor is clever and nerdy and immature in all of the right ways. He is so thoughtful and amazing at communicating, which is especially important because that is not my best trait. I've never been able to talk to anyone the way I can with him... And I've opened up more with J than I ever thought I would (with anyone). I could go on for pages just gushing about how infatuated I am with him. 

Needless to say, we're both serious about this... we've said the I-love-you's and started looking for apartments to move in together in June. We're talking about long-term plans and I've already met a huge chunk of his family. It's real. I never would have imagined myself to jump into a relationship this quickly or intensely, but it's really real. And I'm thrilled!

I want to yell it from treetops and tell the world... but I'm worried that people might think I'm being silly or naive and rushing into it. I am very close with my family and desperately want to tell them that I love him  and how serious we've gotten but I would be really upset if they wrote it off as some sort of tryst. 

So that leads me to my question: Can I tell my family about my intense, new relationship? Or should I wait it out and bring it up on a more "normal" timeline?

TL;DR: I'm 22, in a serious relationship with my boyfriend of 6 months, and I'm dying to tell my family how much I love him, but I'm worried they'll think I'm being too hasty. Should I wait or share my feelings with them?

TITLE: I [18M] met the right person [19F] at the wrong time.

POST: So, currently in college (that's our way of saying before university in the UK) and i've been with this girl for a year and a half. I love her, and think she's amazing. But the downside is, i'm 18. I want to go and experience lots of different things in lots of different places, but I can't go and travel and do amazing things with her. I want to go and do these things myself and make new friends. 

I'm worried however, that if I approach her with this she'll go for it, but when I come back she'll have moved on with the relationship. We both feel the same way about each other, that's clear. Another point to make is that she has made plans to go and travel around Australia herself. 

This may seem like a very selfish post, however I hope you can all understand that i'm young and want to expand my knowledge of the world and have my own individual experiences. For this to happen i'm looking at 2 or so years. Which is a long time I know, but as the title says, I met her too young. I'm not looking for criticism, i'm looking for people's own similar experiences and how they went about dealing with the situation. Thank you for reading, if I don't reply, i'm sleeping.

TL;DR: 18M in college, been with 19F for 1.5 years, but want to travel and experience new things, worried she'll move on if I take time off.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being a bit selfish, but I also understand where you're coming from. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's willing to wait for you or even join you on some of your adventures."
* "I went through something similar with my ex. I wanted to travel and she wanted to settle down. We ended up breaking up, but it was for the best. You need to think about what's best for you and your future."
* "I think you should be honest with her about how you're feeling. It's better to be upfront and have a conversation about it rather than just disappearing on her. You don't want to hurt her, but you also need to think about your own happiness."
* "I'm 22 and I'm still figuring out what I want to do with my life. I think you're being a bit too focused on your own desires and not considering how your actions might affect her. Have you thought about what she wants and needs?"
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you really want. Do you really want to travel and experience new things, or are you just feeling pressured by your peers? You need to be honest with yourself before you can have a meaningful conversation with her."
* "I went through something similar and I ended up taking a break from my partner. It was hard, but it was the best decision for me. You need to think about what's best for you and your future, even if it means hurting someone you care about."

**Key themes:**

* The importance of communication in relationships
* The need to consider the other person's feelings and needs
* The importance of being honest with oneself and one's partner
* The potential consequences of prioritizing one's own desires over the needs of others
* The value of taking time to reflect on one's own desires and goals before making decisions that may affect others.

TITLE: Is my plan reasonable?

POST: First, thank you everybody. I lurk in this sub a decent amount. And have learned tons and gotten out of debt due to your discussions.

30 y/o. No debt of any kind. Single, no children.

Own a reliable vehicle paid off. No large property owned aside from the car.

Income $6780.84 a month before taxes, SS, Medicare, etc.
Rent & utilities is about $1200 a month.
I save $1542 every month into my emergency fund (Currently at $14,909.26).
Deposit $1458 every month into Roth TSP (Currently at $3,745.84).
Deposit $458 every month into Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund 2045 (Currently at $11,460.24).

The remainder I save in my checking account and use for food, fuel, and any other costs.

After I have $20,000 saved up for my emergency fund, I'd like to save at least $50,000 for a down payment on a home. I don't see myself purchasing a home anytime soon but would like to keep the option available by preparing for it.

The nature of my profession requires constant relocation. So I won't buy a home probably till I retire or decide I'm tired of moving every few years and change careers. Is this a good course of action? 

If yes, is there a recommended method to save that $50,000 while earning interest safely and ability to withdraw it without penalties?

If no, what other options should I consider?

Thanks again!

TL;DR: 30 y/o, no debt, single, no kids. Saving aggressively for emergency fund and retirement. Want to save $50,000 for down payment on home, but may not buy a home for years. Is this a good plan? How to save $50,000 safely and withdraw without penalties?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Your plan seems solid, but I'd recommend considering a more diversified investment portfolio. You're currently putting a lot of eggs in one basket with the Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund 2045. Consider spreading your investments across different asset classes and industries to reduce risk.
2. **u/savvy_spender**: I think your plan is great, but you might want to consider setting a specific timeline for when you want to buy a home. This will help you stay focused and motivated to reach your goal. Additionally, you might want to consider exploring other options for saving for a down payment, such as a first-time homebuyer program or a down payment assistance program.
3. **u/financialfreedom**: Your plan is impressive, but I'd like to caution you about the risks of tying up too much money in a single investment. Consider diversifying your investments to reduce risk and increase potential returns. Additionally, you might want to consider exploring other investment options, such as real estate or peer-to-peer lending.
4. **u/personalfinanceexpert**: Your plan is solid, but I'd like to suggest a few tweaks. Consider setting a specific goal for when you want to buy a home, and adjust your savings plan accordingly. Additionally, you might want to consider exploring other options for saving for a down payment, such as a first-time homebuyer program or a down payment assistance program. Finally, make sure you're taking advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, to save for retirement.

Overall, the poster's plan is solid, but there are some areas for improvement and consideration.

TITLE: 20 (m) with a 19(f) girlfriend, need urgent help

POST: Hey guys I need some serious advice on something, my girlfriend of 6 months is losing her sex drive big time, and its really putting a damper on our relationship.

We both have talked about it numerous times but at the end of the day I can't shake the feeling that whenever we do it (1-2 times a week) its only because she knows I'll be upset if we don't.

It never used to be this way when we first started dating, and then she went on BC, which we have both discussed as a possible reason for the decline in her sex drive, but she doesn't want to go off of it and she doesn't seem to mind the lack of sex. 

What truly bothers me about all of it is that I genuinely feel like she doesn't even enjoy it anymore, and therefore the sex itself is sucking, a lot.  

All I wanna know is if laying off of initiating, (which lately has been every time were alone in my room, and getting denied like 40-50% of the time) will help, or if she will merely see it as a relief and be content with rarely ever having sex anymore. help reddit!

TL;DR: 20m with 19f girlfriend, sex drive has declined significantly, she doesn't want to go off BC, and I feel like she doesn't even enjoy it anymore. I'm initiating most of the time and getting denied a lot, what should I do?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 20, she's 19, and you're already worrying about sex? Relax, it's normal for sex drives to fluctuate. Maybe try talking to her about it again, but this time, ask her what she wants and needs. Don't assume you know what's best for her."
* "I'm a woman, and I can tell you that sex drive can be affected by a lot of things, including hormones, stress, and emotional issues. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for men to feel like they're not getting enough sex. But maybe try taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. Is there something else going on in your relationship that's causing tension or stress? Maybe try addressing those issues first, and see if that improves your sex life."
* "I think you're being a bit selfish here. You're focusing on your own desires and needs, but what about your girlfriend's? Maybe she's going through some stuff and doesn't feel like having sex right now. Try being more understanding and supportive, and see if that helps improve your relationship."
* "I'm a sex therapist, and I can tell you that it's not uncommon for couples to experience a decline in their sex drive over time. Maybe try talking to your girlfriend about it, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you. And remember, sex is just one part of a healthy relationship - there are plenty of other ways to connect and show affection."

TITLE: My girlfriend of 2.5 years [28F] wants to have kids with me [28M] I don't. I haven't told them I've had a vasectomy.

POST: We've always used contraception (her taking the pill) but over the last three months she's forgotten taken her pill three times. She's been taking the pill ever since she was a teen, I can not conclude if they've missed it by accident or not. Since she's forgotten her first pill I've worn a condom since.

She has now finished her packet and isn't going to get a prescription so for the foreseeable future (she see's me wearing the condom as good enough, and wants a "break" from artificial hormones).

Now recently, more than usual she's been talking more about wanting to have a family. She's known since the start of our relationship that I do not wish to have one (Do I need to explain to Reddit why? Everyone usually demands an explanation). She thinks I'l change my mind about the topic in the future but I'm certain I won't.

I've never let them know I've had a vasectomy. Do I tell them? Do I keep it to myself?

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants kids, I don't. She's stopped taking the pill, I'm wearing condoms. She's been talking about wanting a family, I've never told her I've had a vasectomy. Should I tell her or keep it a secret?

---

**Comments:**

* "You should definitely tell her. Honesty is always the best policy, especially in a relationship. You're not doing anything wrong by not wanting kids, but you are doing something wrong by not being honest with your partner."
* "I agree with the above comment. You need to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and your vasectomy. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep it a secret and risk hurting her feelings or damaging your relationship."
* "I don't think you should tell her. You've already made it clear that you don't want kids, and she knows that. If she's still pushing for it, maybe she's not respecting your boundaries. You don't owe her an explanation for your vasectomy, and it's not your responsibility to change your mind about having kids just because she wants them."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and your vasectomy, but you should also be prepared for the possibility that she may not be okay with it. You need to be prepared to have a difficult conversation and potentially face the consequences of not wanting kids."
* "I think you should tell her, but you should also be prepared to have a conversation about why you made the decision to get a vasectomy. You need to be honest and open with your partner, but you also need to be prepared to defend your decision and explain why you made it."

TITLE: Should I [22f] ditch this guy [27m], or am I jumping to conclusions too quickly?

POST: We've been dating for about a month or so.

The good about him: he's taken me out to dinner, parties, breakfast, etc. He texts me nearly every day. He seems to communicate well, he's told me that he is looking for a relationship and that he likes me, etc. He told me that he doesn't like to 'hook up' with girls, that he likes to take it 'one at a time.' He said he likes being in relationships.

The bad: the last time we hung out, he seemed disinterested. I felt like I was having to carry the conversation. He didn't actually say much at all during dinner, and we just went home and passed out. One time at a party, I saw him going downstairs with a girl. I followed, and they were hanging out with a bunch of people smoking weed. It got me suspicious. He hasn't mentioned anything about us getting exclusive since we last talked about it awhile back. He seems to party a lot. He doesn't really compliment.

The thing is, I like him, but I don't want to get hurt.

Am I just being over-analytical or is this guy a douche that is just leading me on? Also, how would I tell him that I no longer want to see him? We just hung out the other night, and I acted like everything was fine and dandy. It was when I got home and thought about it that I second guessed this guy.

TL;DR: Guy seems nice, but seems disinterested, parties a lot, hasn't mentioned exclusivity, and doesn't compliment. Am I being too harsh or is this guy not worth my time?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's not really invested in you or the relationship. He's not putting in the effort to keep the conversation going, and he's not making you feel special. You deserve better than someone who doesn't even try to make an effort. Don't waste your time on someone who's just going through the motions."
* "I think you're being too harsh. He's still getting to know you, and it's normal for relationships to have ups and downs. Maybe he's just having a bad day or week. Give him the benefit of the doubt and have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling."
* "I agree with the first commenter. If he's not making an effort to get to know you better, and he's not showing you that he cares, then he's not worth your time. You deserve someone who is going to put in the effort to make you feel special and loved."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate what you want from this relationship. Are you looking for something serious, or are you just looking for someone to hang out with? If you're looking for something serious, then maybe this guy isn't the right one for you. But if you're just looking for someone to hang out with, then maybe he's okay. Just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you're willing to settle for."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Tell him that you feel like he's not making an effort to get to know you better, and that you're not feeling the connection that you thought you would. See how he responds and go from there. If he's not willing to listen and work on the relationship, then maybe it's time to move on." 1

The comments on this post are a mix of opinions, with some people advising the OP to ditch the guy and others suggesting that she should give him the benefit of the doubt and have an open and honest conversation with him about her feelings. Some people are more critical of the guy, saying that he's not making an effort to get to know the OP better and that he's not showing her that he cares. Others are more understanding, suggesting that maybe he's just having a bad day or week and that the OP should give him another chance.

TITLE: Me [20/F] would like to have more 'close' friends [M and F] but I am afraid it'll be bad for my relationship with my SO [23/M] Advice?

POST: Hey everyone, 

I have been in a relationship for about three + years now. 
Short summary: Long distance relationship, will live together in a month, happy relationship, skyping a lot daily; result of that is that I have only 1 close friend (who's moving 300 kilometers away this august) and 2 friends I do not see often. Because I skype a lot and don't do sports anymore I do not have many contacts outside my SO/family. 

I miss laughing, netflix'ing and being lazy with someone (other than my SO) to socialize with. The thing is, he's kind of jealous (distance makes it hard to not go crazy sometimes) and he thinks everyone I meet (example: at work or study) is somehow into me. I do not engage into a social/more-than-colleague relationship because I do not want to cause any trouble. 

Does anyone of you have advice for me about finding a balance? Or how to make my SO accept male-friends/contacts? Make him less jealous? My relationship is very important for me and keeps me going every day. 

Sometimes I just feel like talking about the stuff going on in my head other than my SO [he knows everything anyway] and want to hear another opinion. Right now I feel like I have no one to talk to beside him.

TL;DR: Long distance relationship, happy but missing close friends, SO is jealous, want to find a balance and make him less jealous.

---

This post is a great example of a relationship dilemma that many people can relate to. The OP (original poster) is struggling to find a balance between her relationship with her SO and her desire for close friendships with others. She's afraid that pursuing friendships with others will lead to trouble in her relationship, but she also feels like she's missing out on social connections and experiences.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the situation, including the OP's feelings and concerns. The use of specific details, such as the distance between her and her SO, and the fact that she's been in a long-distance relationship for three years, helps to paint a vivid picture of the situation.

The OP is also open to advice and willing to listen to others' perspectives, which is an important aspect of seeking help and support. The post is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a great example of a well-written post in the r/relationships subreddit.

Some potential responses to this post could include:

* Advice on how to communicate with her SO about her desire for close friendships and how to address his jealousy.
* Suggestions for how to meet new people and form connections outside of her relationship.
* Encouragement to prioritize her own needs and desires, and to not sacrifice her own happiness for the sake of her relationship.
* Personal anecdotes or experiences that may be relevant to the OP's situation.

Overall, this post is a great example of a relationship dilemma that many people can relate to, and it's a great opportunity for others to share their advice and support.

TITLE: I (33M) after recent breakup, don't know if I'm ready for dating again

POST: Hi everyone.

Recently my long term relationship ended, and I'm still struggling with some issues after the break up. Let me summarise:

I was in a relationship for 8 years, half of that living together, which seemed to go very nicely as we were even organising our wedding just before the break up. But important changes in life (mainly me moving to another country for a new job) ended up revealing some insecurities, lies, and finally ending the relationship due to lack of willing to go forward by my ex-partner.

This happened 6 months ago, and even if at the start it was very hard, suddenly living alone in a different country when months ago I was planning a wedding and considering having kids, I was lucky as I joined a very nice group of people at work and my old friends even if far away have helped a lot.

After the first months of missing my ex, it transitioned to just missing being with someone, and then I was able to just focus on myself, enjoying life and improving both my body and mind.

And then... I started considering looking for women and dating. The problem is that I'm not really sure that I'm really prepared for a new relationship, or if I'm looking at it because I feel alone. This was my only serious relationship, so this is unexplored territory for me. Thinking cold about it, I kinda believe that I should wait until I don't feel the need to not be alone (6 months after 8 years is not that much after all). But at the same time I think that this relationship has showed me how much a family guy I am and that I really want to share my life with someone. And being 33 I'm starting to think that I don't have that much time if I want that type of life too..

My question is, how do you know when you are ready to date again, if wanting to be in a relationship is something that you are not going to just forget?

TL;DR: I'm 33M, recently broke up after 8 years, and I'm unsure if I'm ready to date again. I'm looking for advice on how to know when I'm ready to start looking for a new relationship.

TITLE: My [20F] housemate [19F] is dating a guy [23M] who I found on a dating app

POST: Hey all! I'm just looking for a little advice on what to do. 

I just recently moved into a new apartment, and I get on really well with my new housemate, lets call her April. She's funny, and really easy to chill with. I'm hoping we can become good friends. 

Recently (the past 3 months) Aprils's been dating this guy, Greg, that she met on a dating app. She's been turning down other dates and claims that it would be wrong to see other men as she's so into Greg. They hang out regularly, text often and all that good stuff. 

Me, thinking that she had such good luck on the app downloaded it as well. I saw Greg. He was online and had put out a date request, but I can't tell how long ago that was posted. From what I can tell he's still looking for other people. 

The thing is, I don't know my new housemate very well. I understand her to be monogamous, but don't know their relationship dynamic. I don't want it to be weird if I say something, but I also don't want her to get played.

TL;DR: My housemate is dating a guy she met on a dating app, and I saw him online and he's still looking for other people. I don't know what to do.

**What do you think? Should the OP say something to April, or just mind their own business?**


**Possible responses:**

1. **Be honest with April**: The OP should tell April about seeing Greg online and ask her if she knows about it. This way, April can clarify their relationship and the OP can avoid any potential awkwardness.
2. **Mind your own business**: The OP shouldn't say anything to April. It's not their place to know about April's relationship, and it's not their problem if Greg is still looking for other people.
3. **Talk to Greg**: The OP could try to contact Greg and ask him about his intentions with April. This way, the OP can get a better understanding of the situation and avoid any potential drama.
4. **Wait and observe**: The OP could just wait and observe the situation to see how it plays out. If April seems happy and committed to Greg, the OP might not need to say anything.
5. **Have a conversation with April about boundaries**: The OP could have a conversation with April about their own boundaries and expectations for their living situation. This way, they can clarify what they're comfortable with and avoid any potential conflicts.

**What do you think? Should the OP say something to April, or just mind their own business?**


**Additional context:**

* The OP doesn't know April's relationship dynamic, but they assume she's monogamous.
* The OP has only been living with April for a few months.
* The OP is concerned about the potential for drama or awkwardness if they say something to April.
* The OP is looking for advice on what to do in this situation.

TITLE: Told off my friend/boss, what to do?

POST: So I was at a party with my friend (who happens to also be my boss) and the girl I've been seeing/hooking up with. It's a pretty big party and everyone is drinking etc. My girl is acting kinda weird, flirty with other guys and generally not too attentive to me. I tell her I'm feeling tired and want to leave. I walk outside briefly and when I return she's making out with my friend/boss. Basically ended with me telling him off, to go fuck himself, that he fucked up etc and with her begging me to get in the car with her. I ended up getting dropped off by someone else altogether. They both seemed fairly sorry but I still haven't really talked to either one since. Not sure what to do, lots of mixed feelings, work is approaching on Tuesday and ill have to see him.

TL;DR: Got caught up in a situation at a party where my friend/boss was making out with my girlfriend, told him off, now I'm unsure what to do.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Stay calm and don't let emotions cloud your judgment**: Take some time to process your feelings before making any decisions. Remember that you're not a teenager anymore, and you don't have to react impulsively.
* **Have a conversation with your friend/boss**: It's possible that your friend didn't realize the situation was as serious as you did. Have a calm and rational conversation with him about what happened. You might be surprised at how he reacts.
* **Don't be too hard on yourself**: You can't control how others behave, but you can control how you react to the situation. Try not to beat yourself up over it.
* **Talk to your girlfriend**: You need to have a serious conversation with your girlfriend about what happened. Find out why she was acting the way she was and what she was thinking. You might need to re-evaluate the relationship.
* **Don't let this situation affect your work**: Try to separate your personal and professional life. Don't let this situation affect your work or your relationship with your friend/boss.
* **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and emotionally. This situation can be stressful and overwhelming, so prioritize your well-being.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Don't be afraid to set boundaries**: If you're not comfortable with your friend/boss being around your girlfriend, it's okay to set some boundaries. You don't have to be friends with your boss outside of work.
* **Don't let guilt trip you**: Your friend/boss might try to guilt trip you into forgiving him or making things right. Don't let him manipulate you into doing something you're not comfortable with.
* **Don't be too quick to forgive**: Forgiveness is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Make sure you're ready to forgive before you do.
* **Consider a temporary separation**: If your relationship is still in its early stages, it might be a good idea to take some time apart to reflect on what happened and what you want from the relationship.

**FINAL THOUGHTS FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* **Remember that you deserve better**: You deserve to be treated with respect and honesty in your relationships. Don't settle for anything less.
* **Take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being**: This situation can be stressful and overwhelming, so make sure you're taking care of yourself and prioritizing your well-being.

TITLE: I [27M] just became exclusive with [27F], how can I figure out if she likes public affection without suggesting it?

POST: I'm sure it's obvious but I'm new to relationships so excuse the question if it is something blatantly obvious. I'm neutral, but I understand people usually have a preference for whether they like to show public affection or not, eg holding hands/kissing. The girl has been making me take the lead on most things and I'd rather not do it if she isn't overly into it. I also don't want to just naturally do it in case she misunderstands that I prefer to do it.

I'm meeting her for our first date since becoming official later today. Should I perhaps just casually text her asking before we meet, or is there better way to go about it?

TL;DR: I'm meeting my girlfriend for the first time since becoming official and I want to know if she's okay with public affection without suggesting it. Should I text her or do something else?

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my ex [25 F] 8 months. I'm really struggling with what she wants from me.

POST: Okay, so I have a lot of feelings still for my ex, not in the "HEY LETS DATE" again way just emotion I suppose, we broke up (she ended it with me) but used to get angry if I would date someone else. 

She wanted to be friends but yeah, she'd get angry and block me if I went on a date with someone and she found out. It left me in a very weird situation because I like my ex, she's a nice person and I'd prefer her to be in my life rather than completely gone.

few months ago she went out with another guy which is fine but I'm not sure why, the guy she went out with was everything she hated in a guy and I felt like she did it to kind of wind me up by letting me know what they're up to etc. 

Low and behold we had an argument as she found out I was now in a relationship with someone else and we're going great :). when my ex found out she hit the roof with stuff, refused to meet up and talk everything through like adults, wouldn't pick up the phone and eventually blocked me on Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook etc, saying don't contact her. 

So I haven't it's been over 2 months but recently she's unblocked me on these things and I'm weirded out as to why she would? I did what she told me with not contacting her, but now she's unblocked me on all these and 0 contact for that time I'm worried as to who should maybe say the first words? I want her as a friend, she's been a big part of my life and helped me through a lot of difficult times and our relationship seemed good.

TL;DR: Ex ended it with me 8 months ago, we were friends but she'd get angry if I dated someone else, she went out with someone else, I got in a new relationship and she blocked me, recently unblocked me on social media, unsure what to do.

TITLE: She(22f) confuses me so much, I(22m) don't understand what she wants.

POST: Me and this girl have been friends for a little bit. I felt like there has been an attraction between us so I asked her if she thought so. She said she thinks there is something between us but she doesn't want to pressure it.

I asked her if her if she wanted to see where it could go, no pressure. Then she said she's doesn't know and wants to stay friends. I'm okay with that.

Now we hung out again, and she says things that seem like she wants something. Like she's implying that she wants me. For example, We were talking and i mentioned that im slighty younger then her(by 9 months) and she says, " I dont know if this is going to work out between us, i dont go for younger guys" in a flirty way.

What does she mean? I dont get it. Should i make my move next time?

TL;DR: Girl says she doesn't know if she wants to pursue a relationship, but then says things that seem like she wants me. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's playing hard to get. She's giving you mixed signals to see how you react. If you're interested, you could try asking her what she means by her comments. If you're not interested, you could just shrug it off and keep the friendship going."
* "I think you're overthinking this. She's just being friendly and flirtatious. Don't read too much into it. If you're interested, you could try making a move, but don't put too much pressure on it."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate the friendship. If she's not interested in pursuing a relationship, it might be best to just keep the friendship going. You don't want to risk losing a good friend over something that might not work out."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're interested in her and ask her what she wants. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep guessing and getting mixed signals."
* "I think you should just chill and enjoy the friendship. If something develops, it will. If not, you'll still have a good friend. Don't put too much pressure on it."

TITLE: I [18/M] am wondering if I should ask her [18/F] again.

POST: I dated this girl and it was amazing. She was diagnosed with an apathy disorder earlier this year and...We broke up due to her wanting me not to be troubled with her mental disorder. I said to her that it won't bother me but she really wanted it as she wanted to focus on her studies and because this may be my last year she said she thought hard about it and wanted to break up.

2 Months later we talked about it and I asked her questions. She said she still had feelings for me and that over time it will go away. I confessed and told my feelings. I just wanted to know. I told her I won't bother her about it anymore but...I just can't bare to see the feelings go away over time as it is painful...

I want to get back with her but I have this conflicting feeling of not doing it due to what she said of how she does not want to. Should I atleast tell her how I feel about all this? Right now we are good friends and we enjoy each others company, but due to this complicated scenario I just can't stand the thought of us breaking up not due to incompatibility but due to how she decided that I can't handle her mental disorder.

I would love some advice.

TL;DR: I dated a girl with an apathy disorder, we broke up due to her wanting me not to be troubled with her mental disorder. We're still friends, but I still have feelings for her. Should I tell her how I feel and risk getting hurt again or just keep it to myself and enjoy our friendship?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, I think you should have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she still has feelings for you too, and it's better to be open and honest about your emotions rather than bottling them up. Just be prepared for the possibility that she may not feel the same way, and that's okay too."
2. **skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should consider whether or not you're willing to accept her boundaries and limitations. If she's made it clear that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you due to her mental health, it's possible that she's not ready to revisit that. You need to think about whether or not you're willing to accept that and still be friends with her, or if you're holding onto the hope of getting back together."
3. **relationship_ranter**: "I think you should ask yourself why you're so invested in getting back together with her. Is it because you truly care about her and want to be with her, or is it because you're afraid of losing the connection you have with her? If it's the latter, then maybe you should focus on building a connection with someone else who is willing to be in a relationship with you. But if it's the former, then maybe it's worth having a conversation with her about your feelings and seeing where it goes."
4. **mental_health_maven**: "I think it's great that you're considering her mental health and boundaries. It's not always easy to prioritize someone else's needs, but it's clear that you care about her. If you do decide to have a conversation with her, make sure to approach it with empathy and understanding. Remember that her mental health is not something that you can 'fix' or 'cure', but rather something that you can support her with. Good luck!"
5. **realistic_rick**: "I think you should be honest with yourself about the likelihood of getting back together with her. If she's made it clear that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you due to her mental health, it's unlikely that she'll change her mind. You need to think about whether or not you're willing to accept that and move on, or if you're going to hold onto the hope of getting back together and potentially get hurt again."

TITLE: I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life, and it stresses me out almost daily. [22 M]

POST: Pretty much what the title says. I'm about to graduate junior college. I want to start my life with my girlfriend very badly, but I just don't know what to do. All of the things I've had interest in have been deemed un-attainable by friends and family. My best friend regularly tells me not to get my dream job, but to get some office job and shoot for 3 figures. Also: I'm retarded at math, so my original major choice of Astronomer, and my computer choices thereafter are kind of a bust. I thought about being a Writer, Voice Actor, and pretty much every job in the video game industry that doesn't have anything to do with math (not many). Everyone says "Those jobs are really hard to get...you should just work at [insert soul-sucking job here], or in the Oilfields (local industry with a bunch of high-school drop outs, drug addicts and other terrible kinds of people)." Every birthday that goes by it presses down on my shoulders further. Friends complete degrees, start families, own homes, and here I am: 5th year of Junior College because I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I'm stuck in Junior College, unsure of what to do with my life, and it's stressing me out.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: Dude, I feel you. I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I didn't know what I wanted to do, and it was eating away at me. But then I realized that it's okay not to have it all figured out. You don't have to have a 5-year plan. Just take things one step at a time. What are your interests? What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Maybe that can give you a starting point.
2. **u/throwaway7890**: I'm a writer, and I can tell you that it's not as easy as it seems. But if you're passionate about it, it's worth a shot. Have you considered taking some writing classes or joining a writing group? That might help you get your foot in the door.
3. **u/throwaway3456**: I'm in the oilfields, and I can tell you that it's not all bad. It's hard work, but it's honest work. And it's a job that's always in demand. Maybe you should consider that as an option.
4. **u/throwaway6789**: I'm a voice actor, and I can tell you that it's a tough industry to break into. But if you're passionate about it, it's worth a shot. Have you considered taking some voice acting classes or joining a voice acting group? That might help you get your foot in the door.
5. **u/throwaway9012**: I'm a gamer, and I can tell you that the video game industry is a tough industry to break into. But if you're passionate about it, it's worth a shot. Have you considered taking some game development classes or joining a game development group? That might help you get your foot in the door.

TITLE: [HELP][VENT]The vet told me my dog is EXTREMELY aggressive. What steps should I take?

POST: So back story about the dog, His name is lei and I adopted him from my local humane society about a month ago. He's a 4 y.o. shiba inu who, from what I have seen, is the sweetest dog. He also gets along quite well with my cat(he will sometimes bark and try to play with the cat -.-) but other than that they will lay right next to each other and go to sleep. So after having the dog for 2 weeks I thought I would bring him to the vet to turn in his papers and register him in the system. Before doing so, my dog has been around 20+ new people and I've never had any issues with aggression. (No hand biting, growling, snapping, etc) He is really shy around someone he first meets but other than that he's fine. As soon as I got to the vet my dog was clearly nervous/scared/anxious. After waiting for almost an hour to be seen I managed to calm him and have him sit next to me on a bench. Once our name was called, however, the noise from inside scared him out again.(trying to go back out and having his tail down) The lady who takes my dog is clearly irritated at the type of breed I have. She talked to me as if I knew nothing about the breed and snapped angrily about how aggressive the breed was. After waiting for the nurse to return with my dog she proceeded to tell me about how my dog is EXTREMELY people aggressive and ill have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. Then handed me 50 million pamphlets on dog trainers in my area. What should I do? What's the best course of action? Get my dog evaluated? Or go to a different vet? It' crazy because I've been going to this one my whole life and never had an issue.

TL;DR: Adopted a 4 y.o. shiba inu, brought him to the vet to register him, and the vet told me he's EXTREMELY aggressive and I'll have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. What should I do?

---

This post is a great example of how a subreddit can provide support and guidance to users who are experiencing a stressful or concerning situation. The OP (original poster) is clearly upset and frustrated by the vet's behavior and diagnosis, and is seeking advice on what to do next.

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and helpful, with many users sharing their own experiences with aggressive dogs and offering advice on how to address the issue. Some common themes that emerge from the comments include:

* The importance of getting a second opinion from a different vet
* The need to work with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist to address any aggression issues
* The importance of understanding that every dog is an individual and that breed alone is not a reliable indicator of aggression
* The need to take a calm and patient approach when interacting with the dog to help build trust and reduce aggression

Overall, this post and its comments demonstrate the value of online communities like Reddit, where users can share their experiences and seek advice and support from others who may have gone through similar situations.

TITLE: Reddit, what's your worse travel story?

POST: Several years ago, a few drinking buddies and I were driving to Virginia on vacation. After driving for nearly 16 hours straight, we stopped for dinner one night in Maryland. I forget the name of the town or the eatery, but we ate at this little cafe right on the main drag. We were too tired to realize it at the time but the place only served vegan meals. Being the incredible dumbasses that we are, we neglected to read the menu and instead ordered cheeseburgers in the hope that we could eat quick and get back to driving.

The meals come out and we scarf them down, totally oblivious to the  other patron's horror. We pay for our meal and get back on the road, intent on making our destination by morning. About an hour later, we all start to feel rumblies in our tummies.

What happened next will go down in legend.

Simultaneously, the four of us get violently ill inside my buddy's truck. Somehow, and to this day I thank him for it, he gets off to the shoulder of the road and we all sprint for ditch. For the next half hour, anyone on 95 going South could see four rednecks losing their non-vegan, vegan chef prepared meals in the most horrible way possible. It was so bad that even after we were done, none of us could eat or drink anything besides ice chips the rest of the trip

TL;DR: Four friends order cheeseburgers at a vegan cafe, get violently ill on the side of the road, and spend the rest of the trip recovering.

TITLE: Worst travel experience?

POST: I once took a bus from New York to Los Angeles. The bus broke down in the middle of nowhere, and we were stuck there for hours. To make matters worse, the bus company didn't even have a backup plan or a way to communicate with us. We were left stranded with no food, no water, and no way to get in touch with anyone.

But the worst part was yet to come. When we finally got to LA, we discovered that our luggage had been lost or stolen during the breakdown. We were left with nothing but the clothes on our backs and a bunch of useless bus tickets.

I was so frustrated and disappointed that I ended up writing a scathing review of the bus company and sharing it on social media. I hope that my experience will serve as a warning to others and help them avoid the same mistakes.

TL;DR: Bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, passengers left stranded with no food, water, or communication. Luggage lost or stolen, leaving passengers with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Worst travel experience ever.

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my [24 F] hopefully more than one date

POST: Recently, I met someone from an smartphone dating app (not tinder, but similar). We talked for a few days and realized we had a lot of similar interests so we decided to meet up yesterday. We both had a great afternoon and she's someone I'd really like to get closer with. Only problem is she lives 60 miles away, so close enough for a day trip but a little too far just to go for dinner or something like that. I dont live in a major city either and 60 miles is a few counties over.

My question is how can I get to the next level with her despite living an hour away? I dont mind driving but at this point we're still getting to know each other and have to be doing some kind of planned activity to feel comfortable, which is difficult to coordinate when you dont live in the same place and are two busy people.

Any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: Met someone from a dating app, had a great time, but we live an hour apart. How can I get to the next level with her despite the distance?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'd say the key is to find a compromise that works for both of you. Maybe you can plan a weekend getaway to a neutral location halfway between your two homes? That way, you can spend some quality time together and get to know each other better. Alternatively, you could try to find activities or hobbies that you both enjoy and can do remotely, like online gaming or watching the same TV show. Just make sure to communicate openly and honestly with each other about your expectations and boundaries."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being too focused on the distance. What's more important is that you're both interested in getting to know each other. Instead of worrying about how to make it work, focus on building a connection and seeing where things go. You can always figure out the logistics later. Just make sure to be open and honest with each other about your intentions and expectations."
3. **u/longdistanceproblems**: "OP, I feel your pain! I've been in a long-distance relationship before and it's tough. But it's not impossible. You can try to schedule regular video calls or phone calls to stay connected. You can also plan visits to see each other whenever possible. And don't forget to make time for each other's birthdays and holidays. It's all about making an effort to stay connected and make the distance work for you."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being too focused on the logistics. What's more important is that you're both on the same page about what you want from each other. Have an open and honest conversation about your expectations and boundaries. Are you looking for something serious or casual? Are you willing to make sacrifices for the relationship? Once you have a clear understanding of what you both want, you can start working on making it work. Good luck!"

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm a 23-year-old guy who recently met someone from an smartphone dating app. We talked for a few days and realized we had a lot of similar interests, so we decided to meet up yesterday. We both had a great afternoon and she's someone I'd really like to get closer with.

Only problem is she lives 60 miles away, which is a bit of a drive for just a casual dinner or something like that. I don't live in a major city either, so it's not like we can just meet up at a coffee shop or something.

I'm not sure how to get to the next level with her despite the distance. We're both pretty busy, so it's hard to find time to plan something that feels like a real date. I don't mind driving, but I don't want to feel like I'm just dropping by for a quick visit.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you make it work? Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: Met someone from a dating app, had a great time, but we live an hour apart. How can I get to the next level with her despite the distance?

TITLE: TIFU by helping my dad split logs

POST: 2 years ago hurricane sandy came through, and we actually made out pretty well. A fucking massive tree did fall on my house, but it hit another tree on the way down, and that kinda softened the blow. In any case, after a lot of other stories, we got the tree off the house.

My family is pretty good at making the best of things, and we thought "well, now we have a few thousand pounds of firewood!". We have a fireplace that we like to use.

You can't use the logs right away because they have to dry out. I honestly don't remember if we split any last year, but even this year we have plenty left. So, I figured I'd be a good sport and help out, and split some logs.

My dad was in an accident recently, and broke his wrist, so wielding an axe isn't exactly something that's very comfortable for him. Another incentive for me to help out. It's at this point that I should note- He got a brand new handle for the axe about 2 weeks ago.

I grab the axe (actually a maul but whatever) and the sledge, and he gives me some pointers. I hit like 4 logs off center, and make real crappy attempts. At this point I'm feeling like I'm not helping much, but he's cool about it.

On the 5th or 6th log I over swing, and BAM I bust the head clean off the handle. I casually tossed the handle down, looked at my dad, and said "well, looks like I owe you a handle." I felt pretty damn bad.

Fortunately he was cool about it, and said that's part of learning.

TL;DR: I helped my dad split logs, and in the process, I broke the handle off his new axe.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't be like me, kids. Be careful with the axe. And also, don't be like me, kids. Don't be a clumsy oaf.

EDITS:

* Added a TL;DR for clarity
* Changed "axe" to "maul" for accuracy
* Changed "I felt pretty damn good" to "I felt pretty damn bad" for consistency
* Changed "Don't be like me, kids. Be careful with the axe" to "Don't be like me, kids. Be careful with the axe. And also, don't be like me, kids. Don't be a clumsy oaf" for added humor and emphasis

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of their own mistake or mishap. In this case, the author helped their dad split logs, but ended up breaking the handle off his new axe. The post is lighthearted and self-deprecating, with the author acknowledging their own clumsiness and apologizing for the mistake. The comments section is filled with people sharing their own similar stories and offering words of encouragement and advice. Overall, this post is a great example of the humor and camaraderie that can be found on the r/tifu subreddit.

TITLE: Reddit, what's your most regrettable "Socially Awkward Penguin" moment?

POST: So I was visiting San Francisco for the weekend, and I sort of got sucked into attending a "Florence + Machine" concert. I wasn't too excited to be spending my Friday night there but I dealt with it. We were in the assigned seating section and I was glad to see that my seat was next to a very cute blonde gal. After a few minutes, this girl giving me signs that she might be interested in me. As the night went on, these signs became more and more obvious and I wanted to strike up a conversation so badly...but instead I sat there awkwardly the entire night, too afraid to even look in her direction. At one point I thought that if I consumed some alcohol I would think of something great to start the conversation with, but I ended up acting becoming even more awkward. The reason I regret this is because now that I'm back home from California, I have absolutely no way of knowing who she was, where she was from, or if she was actually interested. Plus I'll never be able to explain why I was such an awkward asshole! 

I have to finish with saying that I work in a job that requires me to constantly socialize with people so I have no idea what the hell happened to me to make me freeze.

TL;DR: I attended a concert in San Francisco and had a crush on the girl sitting next to me, but I was too afraid to talk to her and now I regret it.

TITLE: Do my (F25) parents need to meet my SO's (M27) parents?

POST: So my SO's mother lives over 5 hours away from us and my family. She is coming to visit and has made a point of saying how she expects that she will be invited for a dinner or something with my parents.

We have been living together for close to a year, probably going to get married, though I'm not really sure yet. 

I would prefer to wait until we decide to get engaged for this meeting to happen because his mom is bat-shit crazy and talks endlessly about random shit like stories about people we do not know and never will know. 

At the same time she makes no effort to get to know us. She says that "she loves me as her own family" yet really knows nothing about me because on the occasions when we go to visit she doesn't let me get a word in and doesn't seem to want to talk about anything of relevance.

I know my parents' personalities wont jive with her personality, and worry that them getting together is a shit-show waiting to happen. Add this to the fact that I'm not 100% sure on whether I want to marry this guy, I just don't think I should be forced to set up an awkward meeting between my parents and his mother.

We did have a discussion about it before, but he ended up just getting frustrated and dropping it so as to not jeopardize our relationship. But I still feel he is resentful about this and I'm sure it will come up closer to the time when his mother is going to visit.

Am I being fair? How can I explain this to my SO without coming off as being stubborn?

TL;DR: My SO's mom is coming to visit and wants to meet my parents. I don't want to set up the meeting because she's bat-shit crazy and talks endlessly about random stuff, and I'm not sure about marrying him yet. How can I explain this to him without coming off as being stubborn?

* "I would suggest having a conversation with your SO about your concerns and see how he reacts. If he's understanding and willing to work with you, then it might be okay to set up the meeting. But if he gets defensive or dismissive, then it might be better to wait."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic about his mom being 'bat-shit crazy'. Maybe she's just a bit eccentric or enthusiastic. Try to approach the situation with an open mind and see if you can find some common ground."

TITLE: My [36/F] coworker [late 20's/M] who inappropriately hit on me just asked me to write him a letter of recommendation

POST: I am in a very happy relationship and a guy I work with flirted with me a few months back.  He said that he found me "stunning," but he said it in a casual way in the middle of a conversation when we were consulting about something else that was fairly serious.  I was very uncomfortable with it and told my boyfriend about it, which then made him uncomfortable.  He said I did nothing wrong, which I agree with, and since then I've tried to avoid the co-worker as much as possible.

Also since then, it came out that he hooked up with a colleague at work and then treated her poorly, causing her to be so upset she quit the job.  I have noticed many many more ways that he is inappropriate, has horrible boundaries and moreso just has huge issues.  We work in the mental health field and I have a higher position and degree than him so it REALLY bothers me to see how he acts.

Today he asked if I would write a letter of recommendation for him to go to counseling school.  I personally think he could be a good clinician, if he had more training, so I think it's a great idea for him to learn boundaries, ethics, theories, etc.  However, I feel really weird about writing him a letter of recommendation, mainly because my boyfriend was uncomfortable with him flirting with me, and also because I don't think he has good judgement at the moment, but he could eventually have it with the proper training.  I'm a people pleaser so in the moment I said yes.  But now I feel awkward, what do I do?

TL;DR: Coworker who inappropriately hit on me asked me to write a letter of recommendation for him to go to counseling school. I'm torn between doing what I think is best for him and being uncomfortable with the situation due to his past behavior.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you should write the letter. It's not about condoning his past behavior, but about recognizing his potential for growth and change. You can also use this as an opportunity to teach him about boundaries and respect. Just make sure to set clear expectations and boundaries for yourself in the process."

TITLE: I've [21/M] been dating this girl [21/F] for three weeks and I'm not sure if we're moving too fast.

POST: We both have amazing chemistry and it seems we're almost always on the same page. We're both pretty infatuated with each other. Never before had I had the urge to text a girl almost daily (and I'm known as a horrible texter), see a girl often or really get to know them.

We both have never been in a relationship before and are typically scared of commitment. I mentioned last week that I felt we were moving too fast and we should take it slow. I told her I don't want to hurt her if we don't work out and she said she's strong if it happens, and that she said we'll see where time takes us. 

We had one drunken talk this past weekend and admitted our feelings to each other. I said I was falling in love with her and she said she really liked me. At one point in the conversation, she almost said I love you...but stopped. She started getting emotional and started crying and I wasn't sure if it was out of happiness and/or sadness. She said she never gone this far with a guy and I mentioned the same. I said for us to be monogamous but not official to determine if our feelings are real and not circumstantial. 

At these times when I talk about the state of our relationship, I feel like she always agree with what I say and doesn't give any dissent. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. 

I'm probably being an asshole right now. I feel like I'm trying to fight the feeling of falling in love/being in love because I've never felt these feelings before and things are going too smoothly to be true.

TL;DR: I've been dating this girl for three weeks and I'm unsure if we're moving too fast. We have amazing chemistry, but I'm scared of commitment. We've had talks about taking it slow and being monogamous, but I feel like she always agrees with me without giving any dissent.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're not being an asshole. It's normal to feel uncertain about the pace of your relationship, especially if you're both new to this whole thing. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and see how she feels. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, you're 21 and you're already worried about commitment? Relax, you're young, and relationships are supposed to be fun! Don't overthink it, just enjoy the ride and see where it takes you."
3. **RelationshipRookie**: "I'm in a similar situation, and I can relate to your concerns. I think it's great that you're taking the time to think about your feelings and have open conversations with your partner. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better before making any big decisions. Good luck, and I hope things work out for you both!"
4. **CynicalChris**: "Dude, you're just scared of getting hurt. That's normal. But don't let fear hold you back from experiencing something amazing. If you're both on the same page and have a strong connection, then maybe it's worth taking a chance. Just be honest with her about your feelings and concerns, and see how she reacts."
5. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should take a step back and assess your feelings. Are you really falling in love with her, or are you just caught up in the excitement of a new relationship? Take some time to reflect on your emotions and see if your feelings are genuine or just a passing infatuation. Good luck, and I hope you find what you're looking for."

TITLE: Me (26m) have had a falling out with a good friend (25f), but I need to tell her something.

POST: Hello everyone, first off, sorry for the vague title, I suck at titles apparently, let's hope I don't suck at typing the rest ;)

Obligatory mobile/non native sentence.

Long story short, I have/had a very good friend (25f), we had a very good bond but for the past few weeks we had a falling out. 

The problem however is that she is in a bad situation with someone else, her dancing teacher, whom she had an argument with. 
I know her teacher personally as well, so I know every detail of the situation since a few days (before that I wasn't really digging into their problem but it came up in a conversation).

Now the thing is, I know what to say to both of them so that they can resolve their problem, something I know will make my friend a lot happier. 

However, I know she won't like me (or anyone for that matter) interfering with her life and chances are she won't react positive towards me nomatter the outcome.

So what do you guys think I should do?

Option A is I keep completely out of it, nothing changes.

Option B is I do what is necessary for them to fix their problem.

Honestly I care more for her being happy (dancing is a BIG thing for her) then her being pissed at me, hell, I'd see it as an heroic sacrifice, she'll hate me but her she can go back and do something she loves.

So I'm leaning towards B, get myself involved, fix this for her, nomatter the fallout. 

So people, advice please, are you going to talk me into it or out of it?

Cheers!

TL;DR: Had a falling out with a good friend, know how to fix her problem with her dancing teacher, but know she won't like me interfering, should I keep out of it or try to fix it for her happiness?

TITLE: What's the whole 'WakeUpNow' business opportunity and how legitimate is it?

POST: Recently a couple of people I know started promoting this business called 'WakeUpNow'. They were explaining to me how they are this business that offers discounts on travel, groceries, and many other expenses, and it is an opportunity for you to make money by marketing their business. I was told that the system works by getting a certain number of friends & family to'sign up' with this business, and then when you have enough people under you then you can start earning $600 to $10k a month, just by solely marketing the business & signing people up, and supposedly they offer you take vacations at huge discounts, just by "taking a picture of the receipt and posting on a social media website and claim 'in a business meeting', and then the company reimburses you". Now doing some research, some people say they are a scam and don't do it, others say it is a legit business and not a pyramid scheme.

I'm looking for legitimate answers. Is it pyramid scheme? How does this company generate money? Anyone on Reddit have experience (good or bad) with this company. **I am not interested in this company**, I'm just digging for details on what this company is about?

TL;DR: WakeUpNow business opportunity: Legit or pyramid scheme? How does it generate money? Anyone have experience with this company?

---

**Top-voted comments:**

1. **Not a pyramid scheme**: WakeUpNow is a legitimate company that offers discounts on various products and services. They make money by partnering with merchants and taking a commission on each sale made through their platform. The business opportunity is based on recruiting new members, but it's not a pyramid scheme because the focus is on selling products and services, not just recruiting new members.
2. **Scam alert**: WakeUpNow is a pyramid scheme. They make most of their money by recruiting new members and convincing them to buy into the business opportunity. The company doesn't generate revenue from selling products or services, but rather from the fees paid by new members. The "discounts" they offer are often inflated or non-existent.
3. **My experience**: I joined WakeUpNow a year ago and was initially excited about the opportunity. However, I soon realized that the company was more focused on recruiting new members than selling products. I ended up losing money and had to close my account. I would advise others to steer clear of this company.
4. **Research**: WakeUpNow has been the subject of several lawsuits and complaints from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other regulatory agencies. The company has a history of making false claims and using high-pressure sales tactics to recruit new members. It's best to avoid this company altogether.

**Key takeaways:**

* WakeUpNow is a legitimate company that offers discounts on various products and services, but it's also a pyramid scheme.
* The company generates revenue by partnering with merchants and taking a commission on each sale made through their platform.
* The business opportunity is based on recruiting new members, but it's not a pyramid scheme because the focus is on selling products and services, not just recruiting new members.
* WakeUpNow has a history of making false claims and using high-pressure sales tactics to recruit new members.
* It's best to avoid this company altogether and instead look for legitimate business opportunities that focus on selling products and services, not just recruiting new members.

TITLE: [21 M/F] Just Started Seeing This Girl and Her Ex Is Threatening to Hill Himself

POST: Met a great girl last week, we've been clicking so fast and I know that we have something great going for us. We went out on our first date and she explained to me her situation with her ex, which had me in awe and I did not really know what to tell her.

She was about to break up with her ex when I think he started to sense she was going to. They were staying in a hotel for the weekend, and he threatened to kill himself by jumping off a balcony. When she tried to restrain him he threw her away where she ended up going through a glass table. To add fuel to the fire he began telling people she raped him on the trip and he doesn't trust her anymore.

The worst part is he texts her just about everyday and she is clueless on how to handle it. She doesn't want to feel responsible if she does end up killing herself, and she complies to talk to him just to avoid this. She assured me there are no feelings at all, but she does it because she couldn't live with herself.

I literally had no idea how to respond. I told her I was glad she was sharing this with me, but I really don't know how the handle the situation. Usually when people say they're going to kill themselves over a girlfriend, it's just to find a little glimmer of hope and to hold on to something that is not there. This girl has a huge heart and I think she really doesn't want to feel that guilt.

How do I go about helping her out in this situation? It seems really tricky and I don't want to get in the middle, but I really like this girl and he needs to back the fuck off.

TL;DR: Girl's ex is threatening to kill himself over her, and she's torn between feeling responsible and avoiding the guilt. I'm unsure how to help her handle the situation without getting in the middle.

**Responses:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, you're in a tough spot. It's great that you're concerned about the girl's well-being, but you need to prioritize her safety above all else. I would recommend that she report the ex's threats to the authorities and seek a restraining order. It's also important for her to have a support system in place, such as a therapist or a trusted friend or family member. You can offer to be that support system for her, but it's crucial that you don't try to handle the situation on your own. Let the professionals handle it."
2. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's important to consider: the ex's threats are likely a manipulation tactic to control the girl and make her feel guilty. It's possible that he's not actually suicidal, but rather using this as a way to get attention and sympathy. I'm not saying that the girl's feelings aren't valid, but it's important to consider the possibility that the ex is playing her. Maybe the girl needs to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation, and maybe she needs to set some boundaries with the ex."
3. **u/concerned_citizen**: "OP, I'm glad you're concerned about the girl's well-being, but you need to be careful not to get in the middle of this situation. It's not your responsibility to handle the ex's threats or to try to fix the situation. Instead, encourage the girl to seek help from the authorities and a therapist. It's also important for her to have a support system in place, such as a trusted friend or family member. You can offer to be that support system for her, but it's crucial that you don't try to handle the situation on your own."

TITLE: I[22/F] suspect my guy-friend[24/M] who wants to sleep with me is still taken and using me to sleep around with

POST: My friend 'Sean' and I have known each other for a little over three years. We're fairly good friends, but somewhat fell out of contact a while ago when he graduated from our university. We share a pretty large friend group, though, and they usually know how he's doing and trying to invite him to our outings. Through the group I knew that Sean was dating 'Maggie', a younger girl(19) from out of town. 

But last April, Sean contacted me out of the blue and started striking up conversations over messenger, ostensibly to seehow I was. I enjoyed talking to him again after a few months of no contact, and soon after our conversations started he told me he had been thinking about me and wanted to sleep together at some point. I asked if he was still with Maggie, and he said he had broken up with her the past month.

We continued to banter the following months, and eventually scheduled our first 'date' for this upcoming Saturday. I was pretty excited, and was hanging out with some of the guys from our friend group today. Sean's best friend, 'Matthew', didn't seem to know that Sean and I were seeing each other, which struck me as weird since Sean tells Matthew everything. Later that day, Matthew also offhandedly mention that he had been hanging out with "Sean and his girlfriend" last weekend.

I'm not sure if it's a misunderstanding or if I'm overreacting, but I'm worried that Sean may still be seeing Maggie and trying to sleep with me behind her back. I had a big crush on him a year or so ago(which he knew about and did not return at the time), and I'm worried he might just be trying to take advantage of me and my feelings. How do I broach this subject with him without sounding accusatory?

TL;DR: I'm worried that my guy-friend who wants to sleep with me might still be in a relationship and using me to sleep around with. How do I bring this up with him without sounding accusatory?

**Comments:**

* "I would have a calm and honest conversation with him. Let him know that you're concerned about his relationship status and how you feel about the situation. Be specific about what you've observed and how it's making you feel. If he's still in a relationship, he should be honest with you and end things with you. If he's not, then he should be honest with you about his intentions and boundaries. Remember that you deserve respect and honesty in any relationship."
* "I would ask him directly if he's still in a relationship with Maggie. If he says no, then ask him about his plans for the future and what he's looking for in a relationship. If he says yes, then you need to decide if you're comfortable being involved with someone who's still in a relationship. Remember that you deserve better than to be used as a rebound or a secret."
* "I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating the situation. If Sean is still in a relationship, then he's not being honest with you and you deserve better than that. If he's not in a relationship, then you need to decide if you're comfortable with the idea of being in a casual relationship with someone who's still got feelings for someone else. Remember that you deserve respect and honesty in any relationship."
* "I would tell him that you're not comfortable with the situation and that you need to know the truth.

TITLE: Spanish/English speakers of Reddit. What are good resources/tools to help a 20 year old Spanish speaker learn basic English?

POST: I am working with the Migrant Education program in New Hampshire. This boy is 20 years old, a Spanish speaker, and knows very little English. He wants to learn basic vocabulary in English. So far I have been looking for podcasts to put on his Ipod to listen to while he works. However, most of these podcasts are too advanced. He has also expressed interest in watching movies in English with Spanish subtitles, but most of these movies move too fast for him. I am trying to find something that moves slower without being at a child's interest level. His English is EXTREMELY limited. What tools/tricks do you suggest?

TL;DR: 20 year old Spanish speaker wants to learn basic English vocabulary. Looking for resources that are not too advanced, but not too slow either. Podcasts and movies with Spanish subtitles are a good start, but need something more.

**Top comments:**

1. "I think Duolingo is a great resource for beginners. It's free, interactive, and has a gentle learning curve. You can also find English language learning apps specifically designed for Spanish speakers, like Babbel or Rosetta Stone. For movies, try watching cartoons or children's shows with Spanish subtitles. They're usually slower-paced and easier to follow."
2. "I'm a Spanish speaker and I learned English with the help of TV shows and movies with subtitles. I recommend starting with shows like 'Sesame Street' or 'The Muppet Babies'. They're designed for young children, but the language is simple and easy to understand. You can also try watching documentaries or cooking shows with subtitles."
3. "I think it's great that you're trying to help him learn English! For podcasts, you can try 'Coffee Break English' or 'News in Slow English'. They're designed for beginners and are spoken at a slower pace. For movies, try watching 'The Simpsons' with Spanish subtitles. It's a classic show that's easy to follow and has a lot of repetition."
4. "I'm a teacher and I've worked with many students who are learning English as a second language. One of the most effective resources I've found is 'English Central'. It's a website that allows you to watch videos with subtitles and practice your pronunciation by repeating the words and phrases. It's a great way to improve your listening and speaking skills."
5. "I think it's important to remember that learning a language is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. Encourage him to keep practicing and to not be afraid to make mistakes. You can also try using flashcards or playing language learning games with him to make it more fun and engaging."

TITLE: My girlfriend[22F] told me[22M] "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?"... We have been together for almost 3 years.

POST: I've heard that phrase 2 or 3 times and I've had enough. Sometimes I feel like she wants ME to end the relationship for whatever reason. After a small argument we had, it went something like this.

Her: "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?"

Me: "Because I love you? Are you telling me that you want this to end?"

Her: "No" 

Me: "So why did you bring that up?"

Her: "I love you so much and it's not like I want to solve this by breaking up, but I don't want to hurt you"

She's very sweet and she always tells me how "happy" she is with me, our sex life is great (she lost her virginity with me), we always have a great time when we are together, etc... Most of our problems are caused by lack of communication or misunderstandings.

Lately I've had a "feeling" that shes hiding something from me, she's "acting" normal, but I just have that strange feeling that something is not "right", for example, a few days ago she went out with her sister (that's what she told me, honestly I'm not sure) to do some errands, she was SO reserved when she was explaining me what she was doing, where she was and why she didn't replied to my messages... Some stuff seemed a little bit "suspicious".

When she goes out with her sister (or her mom) she always messages me "We are almost home", but that day she wrote "I'm almost home", implying she was alone. Maybe I'm just f****** crazy. We live like 3 hours away so we only see each other like once per week.

TL;DR: My girlfriend says "Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?" and it makes me feel like she wants me to end the relationship. I love her, but I'm starting to feel like she's hiding something from me.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Dude, it sounds like she's trying to guilt trip you into ending the relationship. She's not directly saying 'I want to break up', but she's making you feel like you're not good enough for her. You deserve better than that. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how her words make you feel."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're overthinking things. She's probably just feeling guilty about causing you stress and wants to make sure you're okay. Try to have a calm conversation with her about your feelings and see if you can work through this together. Remember, relationships are about compromise and communication."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not saying you're crazy, but it does seem like you're reading a lot into things. Maybe she was just having a bad day or was stressed about something else. Have you talked to her about your concerns? It's possible she's not hiding anything and you're just misinterpreting things."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "This is a classic sign of emotional manipulation. She's using guilt and self-pity to control the relationship. You need to set boundaries and communicate your feelings clearly. Tell her that you love her, but you won't engage in conversations that make you feel bad about yourself. You deserve respect and honesty in your relationship."
5. **u/just_a_viewer**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If she's consistently making you feel bad about yourself and you're not sure what's going on, it might be time to re-assess whether this is a healthy relationship for you."

---

This post highlights the importance of communication and emotional intelligence in relationships. The OP is feeling frustrated and uncertain about his girlfriend's behavior, and the comments offer a range of perspectives on how to navigate this situation. Some commenters suggest that the OP's girlfriend may be using guilt and self-pity to control the relationship, while others encourage the OP to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings.

The post also raises questions about trust and intimacy in relationships. The OP is feeling uncertain about his girlfriend's behavior, and is wondering if she is hiding something from him. This uncertainty can create a sense of distance and disconnection in the relationship, and can make it difficult for the OP to feel emotionally connected to his girlfriend.

Ultimately, the success of the relationship will depend on the OP's ability to communicate his feelings and concerns with his girlfriend, and her willingness to listen and work through these issues together. It's possible that the relationship can be salvaged with open and honest communication, but it's also possible that the OP may need to re-evaluate whether this is a healthy and fulfilling relationship for him.

TITLE: "Give the goat head"?

POST: A coworker of mine said, "I'll run some preliminary tests first before I give you the goat head" over AIM. 

Should I have corrected him? If so, how should I have responded?

I'm asking reddit because there are a lot of people who have (strong) opinions on grammar nazis and when to behave like one. 

My opinion is that so long as the main message is conveyed well enough, I don't say a word. (For example, everyone knows what a grammar nazi is. Should I have taken the time to find out whether "grammer" and/or "nazi" should be capitalized? I don't think so.) But I also wouldn't mind if someone corrected me. It's kind of for my own edification, and I think it improves how well I can express myself with words.

So, in the case with my convo with my coworker, I didn't say anything because I knew what he meant. But I also thought, "What if he uses that phrase incorrectly again? What if someone corrects him later and he thinks that I don't know the correct usage because I didn't say anything?" I might be thinking about this too much. 

Anyway, what would you have done?

TL;DR: Coworker said "give the goat head" over AIM, and I didn't correct him. Should I have? 

---

**Top comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: I think you did the right thing. If your coworker knows what he means, but uses a phrase incorrectly, it's not your job to correct him. You're not his grammar teacher. Just let it go and focus on the task at hand.
* **u/EnglishMajor**: I disagree. As a language enthusiast, I think it's our duty to help others improve their language skills. If your coworker is using a phrase incorrectly, it's an opportunity to educate him and help him become a better communicator. You could have responded with a gentle correction, like "I think you mean 'give the go-ahead'?".
* **u/ GrammarNazi**: Ugh, this is a perfect example of why I hate when people don't correct each other's grammar. "Give the goat head" is a ridiculous phrase and it's not even a real idiom! If you don't correct your coworker, he'll never learn to use language correctly. You should have spoken up and said, "Excuse me, but I think you mean 'give the go-ahead' or 'give the green light'."
* **u/ laidback**: Chill out, guys. It's just a phrase. If your coworker knows what he means, who cares if he uses the wrong words? It's not like it's affecting the quality of his work or anything. Just relax and focus on the task at hand. Don't sweat the small stuff.

**Original poster's response:**

Thanks for the feedback, everyone! I think I'm going to take a middle ground approach. If I notice my coworker using a phrase incorrectly again, I might casually mention it to him and see how he reacts. If he's open to learning and improving, I'll be happy to help him out. But if he's not interested in learning, I'll just let it go and focus on our work. Thanks for the discussion!

TITLE: I [23F] was seeing a guy [26M] for about 2 weeks. I think he took nudes of me, and may have shared them.

POST: Ok. So I was hooking up with a cowoker (I know, horrible idea) for about two weeks back in August before I broke things off. There were several red flags: 

1) I told me he "loved" me after about three days.

2) He didn't understand the word no, and I had to either yell at him to stop trying to have sex with me or physically leave the room for him to get the message (made even worse by the fact that I, myself, have been raped and he was aware of this.

3) There were two/three incidents when I was in bed, naked, mostly asleep, he had his phone out and pointed towards me. 

4) When I tried to end things, he grabbed my wrists really freakin' hard and pulled me towards him while yelling "NO!", and that I couldn't break up with him because he loves me (I'm 133, he was like 200? of solid muscle). Super scary.

Now, I don't know for sure if he actually took any photos of me. But he recently switched to working the night shift, where I work middle shift - so I do still have some interaction with the night shift people. Since he started working nights, people at work have started treating me differently. 

So, I don't know what to do. The last time I saw him at work, I said we needed to talk, but was running late for the bus, so I had to go. I gave it two days and then texted him about it. No response. Any advice? I am partially hesitant to see him one-on-one as he did scare me a lot...but I feel like I have to know what's going on and if he took any pictures of me.

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend (26M) may have taken nudes of me, and possibly shared them. He's been acting suspiciously since switching to night shift, and coworkers are treating me differently. I'm unsure what to do, and I'm scared to confront him one-on-one.

**Edit:** I should add that I have already talked to HR about the situation, and they're looking into it. I'm just looking for advice on what to do next and how to handle the situation.**Edit 2:** I've been getting a lot of great advice, and I appreciate it. I just wanted to add that I've also been talking to a therapist about the whole situation, and it's been really helpful. I'm trying to prioritize my own safety and well-being right now.**Edit 3:** I just wanted to update that HR has spoken to the guy, and he's been suspended pending an investigation. I'm still trying to process everything, but I'm feeling a little more relieved that something is being done.**Edit 4:** I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has been offering advice and support. It means a lot to me. I'm still trying to heal and move forward, but I'm feeling a little more empowered knowing that I'm not alone in this.**Edit 5:** I just wanted to update that the investigation is still ongoing, but I've been told that the guy has admitted to taking the photos and sharing them. I'm still trying to process everything, but I'm feeling a little more relieved that the truth is out.**Edit 6:** I just wanted to say thank you again to everyone who has been supporting me through this.

TITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend[26 M] of almost 2 years, live with his parents, we're trying to get healthy. How do I get his mother to understand this?

POST: So my boyfriend and I stay with his parents, and we are both constantly on the go. We are saving to buy our own place and we live in Hawaii so it is very expensive here. So, just moving out isn't an option. 

He and I are trying to eat healthier (his parents say they are too) but when I cook, I need to cook enough for everyone in the house rather than just the 2 of us. That would mean 6 of us total. 

His mom does the grocery shopping and we do some as well. I am getting so sick of her buying crap food. She buys only cheap and processed food and if I don't cook then they eat crap when I'm not there or if I don't cook. I could do all the grocery shopping but thats expensive for a family of 6. She says she wants to eat healthy but all she buys is crap. Spam, vienna sausages, ground beef, cream of mushroom, and other things.  NEVER buys fruit and when she does, it goes bad because she doesnt cut. it only gets cut if my boyfriend or myself cut it. She'll buy vegetable here and there but rarely because she says they go bad to fast, but thats because she's always trying to make junk food.

 And for meal prepping, thats impossible in that house. If you have food in there, and someone wants to eat, there it goes! I can deal with this but its mainly the buying groceries and cooking. I don't know what to do with this woman. I understand she gets home late from work and just wants to throw stuff together but shes going about this wrong. What do i do?

TL;DR: I'm living with my boyfriend and his parents, we're trying to eat healthier, but his mom keeps buying cheap and processed food. I'm getting frustrated because I feel like I'm the only one who cares about our health. How do I get her to understand and change her ways?

---

This post is a great example of a common issue in many households: conflicting values and habits when it comes to food and health. The OP (original poster) is frustrated because she feels like she's the only one who cares about their health, and his mom's constant buying of cheap and processed food is making it difficult for them to achieve their goals.

The OP is looking for advice on how to get his mom to understand and change her ways, but it's not a simple issue. His mom may have her own reasons for buying the food she does, such as convenience, cost, or cultural background. The OP may need to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, rather than frustration and blame.

Some possible ways to address this issue could be:

* Having an open and honest conversation with his mom about their concerns and goals for healthy eating
* Offering to help with grocery shopping and meal planning to find healthier options that everyone can agree on
* Suggesting small changes, such as adding more fruits and vegetables to their meals, rather than trying to overhaul their entire diet at once
* Encouraging his mom to share her own reasons for buying the food she does, and finding common ground and understanding

Ultimately, the key to resolving this issue will be to approach it with empathy, understanding, and open communication. The OP may need to be patient and flexible, and willing to find compromises that work for everyone in the household.

TITLE: Reddit, I got yelled at for standing up at a concert while the people behind me wanted to sit. Am I the asshole?

POST: I was at a concert this weekend supporting my favorite artist. Most of the amphitheater was standing, however *some* people in my section were not (including some people behind me and to my right). All of a sudden at the end of the set I got basically shoved in the back and told to sit down. I told them absolutely not, I want to support my favorite artist (who kept saying STAND UP, btw). I paid over $100 for these seats and I want to have a great time.. after all this IS a concert. Not to mention, I heard them calling me names before they confronted me so now I was certainly not going to sit down. Then a few songs later the woman sitting next to me told me what a bitch I was for not letting the people behind me see. Was I in the wrong here?

TL;DR: Got yelled at for standing up at a concert while people behind me wanted to sit. Am I the asshole?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not the asshole for standing up and enjoying the concert. You paid for those seats and you should be able to enjoy the show without being bullied by others."
* "I'm with you on this one. If people want to sit, they should've gotten seats in the seated area. You're not obligated to sit just because others want to."
* "I think you're being a bit dramatic. It's just a concert, it's not worth getting into a fight over. Maybe just apologize and move on?"
* "I'm the asshole who sat behind you and got annoyed when you stood up. I didn't pay $100 for those seats and I didn't want to be squished. But I didn't yell at you or try to make you sit down. Maybe we could've just compromised and taken turns standing?"
* "You're not the asshole for standing up, but you are the asshole for not compromising with the people behind you. Maybe you could've found a way to make it work for everyone?"

This post highlights the age-old debate about whether it's acceptable to stand up during a concert, especially when others around you want to sit. The original poster (OP) is adamant that they have the right to stand up and enjoy the show, citing the artist's encouragement to do so. However, the people behind them are upset because they want to sit and enjoy the concert in a more relaxed manner.

The comments section is divided, with some people siding with the OP and others suggesting that they should have compromised with the people behind them. Some commenters point out that the OP paid for the seats and should be able to enjoy the show as they see fit, while others argue that the people behind them have a right to enjoy the concert in their own way.

Ultimately, the post raises questions about personal space, compromise, and the importance of respecting others' preferences. It also highlights the challenges of navigating social situations in public spaces, where conflicting desires and expectations can lead to conflict.

TITLE: I owe Chase 50K and they won't let me pay, what do I do?

POST: I have been unemployed (or without full time employment) since graduating in December of 2010. In September of 2011 my loans became due. I tried to deal with them then by staggering payments and trying to get an economic forbearance, but they would have none of if. Yesterday I called them again to try to work out a payment plan and they told me that the loan has been "charged off", and that I would have to deal with Chase's collections branch. They (the collections office) told me that the loan was now due in full. They added that no payment options were available aside from full payment, financing would have to be obtained through an outside party. I have no credit, I have no job, there is no one that is going to loan me 50K right now. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do at this point. 

side info: this is two private student loans, my wife co-signed, I own a house that I'm afraid will have a lien put on.

TL;DR: I owe Chase 50K, they won't let me pay, what do I do?

TITLE: Should my brother of 13 years be allowed to play Skyrim?

POST: Background: My brother wants to start playing Skyrim. Since I used to be a notorious gamer myself my father has asked me to decide if my brother should be able to play this game or if he really is to young, since its age limit is 16 (in my country). 
Now I'm not sure what to say on the one hand I don't want to be the bad parent to my brother that doesn't allow him to have fun (you know how these kids are) but on the other hand I want to provide a fair evaluation why he should or should not be able to play, to my father.

Could you also name reasons (for instance what parts in the game make it an absolute nogo) for why he should or should not be able to play.

TL;DR: Should my 13-year-old brother be allowed to play Skyrim, and what are the reasons for or against it?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not about the age limit, it's about your brother's maturity level. If he's responsible enough to handle the game's content, then it's okay. But if he's not, then it's not. You should have a conversation with him about the game's themes, violence, and mature content. If he's not prepared to handle it, then it's best to wait until he's older."
2. **u/GamerGuru99**: "I think it's okay to let him play, but with some restrictions. You could set limits on how long he can play, what time of day he can play, and what parts of the game he can access. For example, you could disable the blood and gore, or limit his access to certain areas of the game. It's all about finding a balance between letting him have fun and keeping him safe."
3. **u/MomOfThree**: "I think it's a great idea to let him play! Skyrim is an amazing game, and it's a great way to encourage his creativity and problem-solving skills. Just make sure to have open conversations with him about the game's themes and content, and set some boundaries to ensure he's not exposed to anything that might be too mature for him."
4. **u/ConcernedCitizen**: "I think it's a bad idea to let him play. Skyrim is a game that's designed for adults, and it's not suitable for children. The game contains mature themes, violence, and strong language, which could be harmful to a 13-year-old's developing mind. It's better to wait until he's older and more mature before letting him play."

**Conclusion:** The top comments on this post highlight the importance of considering your brother's maturity level and individual development when deciding whether or not to let him play Skyrim. While some commenters argue that the game is suitable for a 13-year-old with proper guidance and restrictions, others believe that it's too mature for a child of that age. Ultimately, the decision depends on your brother's individual maturity and your ability to have open and honest conversations with him about the game's content. It's also important to consider setting boundaries and restrictions to ensure his safety and well-being.

TITLE: I [20F] am finding myself seeking validation of my appearance from others, while not taking seriously my long-term boyfriend [20M]

POST: I think part of this has to do with the fact that I spend a lot of time with my boyfriend and his friends, so I'm constantly exposed to the way his friends talk about girls - not in a derogatory way, just kind of admiring certain girls' beauty and bodies.  I feel really immature for getting insecure when this happens because I know I'm pretty and I'm sure any of those guys would say the same. My boyfriend has hinted that his friends have said things about me being attractive before, but he always refuses to go into detail. I just wish every time I hung out with them I wasn't wearing sweatpants with no makeup on, because I feel like then they'd think of me less like a bro, and more like a hot girl. When I talk to my boyfriend about this and he tells me I'm beautiful, it just seems meaningless because of course he'd say that - he's my boyfriend. I feel really stupid and selfish for wanting more because I'm truly in a really happy relationship. I am just sick of my insecurities and I was wondering if this is a normal thing to feel. Does any of this make sense? Sorry, I'm typing on my phone so it's hard to look back and proofread.

TL;DR: I'm a 20F who's feeling insecure about my appearance and seeking validation from others, including my boyfriend and his friends. I know I'm pretty, but I feel like I need to be "on" all the time to be seen as attractive. I'm in a happy relationship, but I'm still feeling this way. Is this normal?

RESPONSES:

* "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I used to feel the same way, especially when I was younger. It's like you're constantly seeking validation from others to feel good about yourself. But here's the thing: you're already in a happy relationship with someone who loves and accepts you for who you are. Why are you still seeking validation from others? Maybe it's time to focus on building your self-confidence and self-worth. You are more than just your physical appearance, and you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are as a person."
* "I think it's normal to feel this way, especially when you're surrounded by people who are constantly talking about physical appearance. But here's the thing: you're not alone in this. I'm sure many people, especially women, feel the same way. It's like we're constantly being bombarded with messages that we need to look a certain way to be attractive. But the truth is, beauty is so much more than just physical appearance. It's about being confident, kind, and genuine. So, instead of seeking validation from others, try focusing on building your own self-confidence. You are beautiful, inside and out, and you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are."
* "I think it's great that you're recognizing your insecurities and wanting to work on them. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not happy with ourselves. I would suggest trying to focus on the things that make you feel good about yourself, whether it's your personality, your accomplishments, or your relationships. And remember, it's okay to not be perfect. Nobody is. You're already in a happy relationship, so try to focus on the positive aspects of that and build on it. You are beautiful, and you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are."
* "I think it's normal to feel this way, especially when you're in a relationship and you're constantly being exposed to different people and their opinions. But here's the thing: you're not alone in this. I'm sure many people, especially women, feel the same way. It's like we're constantly being bombarded with messages that we need to look a certain way to be attractive. But the truth is, beauty is so much more than just physical appearance. It's about being confident, kind, and genuine. So, instead of seeking validation from others, try focusing on building your own self-confidence. You are beautiful, inside and out, and you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are."

These responses all offer words of encouragement and support, urging the OP to focus on building her self-confidence and self-worth rather than seeking validation from others. They also remind her that beauty is more than just physical appearance and that she deserves to be loved and respected for who she is. The responses are all positive and uplifting, and they offer the OP a sense of community and support.

TITLE: TIFU by getting some food.

POST: Well this happened about an hour ago. I was at a restaurant with family. We ordered our food and sat down to eat. All was good up until we finished our food. At this restaurant they gave us Styrofoam plates and my cousin thought it was pretty funny to write "suck my ass :)" onto  his plate and it was directed at me. We didn't think much of it and we figured they are going to get thrown away. At this particular restaurant they didn't have a trash can and we had to give them the plates our selves. We left not thinking about it at all. As we were about to leave the owner or manager of this establishment told us we might as well not come back for the note we left them and now I can no longer go back. The worst part is one of them was a teacher at my school and its a pretty small town. I have no idea what tommorow has in store  for me but I hope it just blows over.

TL;DR: Wrote a note on a plate at a restaurant and now I'm in trouble with the owner and a teacher at my school.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) made a careless mistake by writing a note on a plate, which led to unintended consequences. The note was meant as a joke, but it ended up causing trouble for the OP and his family.

The story is relatable because it's easy to imagine a similar situation happening to anyone. We've all had moments where we've acted impulsively or made a mistake, and this post shows that even small mistakes can have significant consequences.

The OP's regret and concern about the situation are also palpable. He's worried about the impact on his relationships with the teacher and the restaurant, and he's unsure of how to make things right. This uncertainty and anxiety are common feelings when we've made a mistake, and the OP's post is a great example of how we can learn from our mistakes and grow as a result.

Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story, and it's a reminder that even small mistakes can have big consequences. It's also a reminder to think before we act and to consider the potential consequences of our actions.

TITLE: Speeding down highway. Can I get a ticket?

POST: 18, Male, Tennessee.
I was speeding, like 120 in a 65. Some girl kept trying to speed up with me in a shit car, I drive a turbo g35 it was no match but she wouldn't budge she'd push her little car around trying to pass me, and obviously putting her life in danger, I'm no godly driver but I know my car, and the road. I knew what I could do speed wise, and I constantly took it back to around 80 before she'd speed up. Eventually I had to turn, and she held up her phone, and a piece of paper, I assumed it was her number but now that I think about it she probably got my tags and plans to report or something, I want to know could I get in trouble? 
On mobile.

TL;DR: Speeding on highway, girl in a shit car kept trying to pass me, I didn't let her, now she might report me.

TITLE: Babysat a kitten over the weekend who turned out to have fleas - what should I do?

POST: I'm looking for some advice - I babysat a kitten over the weekend who it seems like just started getting fleas.  The owner had been aware of the flea dirt, but didn't do anything about it (and also didn't tell me that this was happening).  I found a few adult fleas on the kitten, and informed the owner and told her she needs to treat the kitten.  Now, I'm wondering what I should do about my apartment.  It seems like this was early on in terms of when the fleas started, however, I'm worried because I was hoping to adopt a new cat soon as my former cat passed away earlier this month.  Do you guys have any advice for how to treat my apartment and also how worried should I be about possible flea infestation?

TL;DR: Babysat a kitten with fleas, owner didn't tell me, now I'm worried about my apartment and potential flea infestation.

COMMENT 1:
"Ah man, that's a bummer!  First off, congratulations on being aware of the situation and taking action.  As for your apartment, I would recommend vacuuming and mopping like crazy, especially in areas where the kitten spent time.  You should also wash any blankets or toys the kitten used.  As for the possibility of flea infestation, it's definitely a risk, but it's not the end of the world.  Just be vigilant and keep an eye out for any signs of fleas (like flea dirt or actual fleas).  If you do notice any, you can always use some flea meds or consult with a vet.  And hey, if you do end up adopting a new cat, you can always get them flea meds and take preventative measures to avoid any future infestations!"

COMMENT 2:
"Yikes, that's a big responsibility!  I would definitely recommend washing any clothes or bedding that the kitten came into contact with, and also giving your apartment a good deep clean.  You might also want to consider using some flea bombs or foggers to get rid of any remaining fleas.  As for the risk of flea infestation, it's definitely there, but like the other commenter said, just be vigilant and keep an eye out for any signs.  If you do notice any, you can always consult with a vet or use some over-the-counter flea meds.  And hey, if you do end up adopting a new cat, make sure to get them flea meds and take preventative measures to avoid any future infestations!"

COMMENT 3:
"Ugh, fleas are the worst!  First off, kudos to you for being aware of the situation and taking action.  As for your apartment, I would recommend giving it a good deep clean, especially in areas where the kitten spent time.  You should also wash any blankets or toys the kitten used, and consider using some flea bombs or foggers to get rid of any remaining fleas.

TITLE: Reddit: What MacGyver moments have made you feel like a total badass? I'll start....

POST: Just got inside from my apartment balcony after a half hour of trying to fish an envelope off the balcony below me with a tent pole. So I was going to throw my credit card down to my son's mom who was going to buy him some Pop Tarts because I'm on the 3rd floor and she'd just run down with the wrong card by accident and didn't want to come back up. I put it in a random envelope that was on my table just because it felt like the right thing to do before tossing it down and the envelope caught the wind and sailed onto the balcony directly beneath mine, which belongs to an unoccupied apartment. Too far from my balcony or the ground floor for a broom to reach, maintenance guy not available, I ponder 5 minutes or so. A light bulb flashes in my head....tent pole. I inserted each segment of the pole into the end of the other, but ultimately when I held it vertically the weight of it pulled it apart. Pulled it back up, scotch taped each joint (no good tape in the apartment, of course), gave it another 20 minutes, and bam, knocked it to the ground and went down and got it. My son's enjoying a blueberry poptart....Fuck yeah

TL;DR: MacGyvered a tent pole into a makeshift fishing pole to retrieve an envelope from an unoccupied balcony, and it worked!

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

1. "That's not MacGyvering, that's just being resourceful and determined. But I love the spirit!"

TITLE: [18m]Hit off with girl at party, exchanged numbers, she set up a date... Now she says she might cancel due to studying, not sure how to proceed.

POST: Met a girl last night at a party, we talked ages and then exchanged numbers, she invited me for a drink at a bar this evening, earlier when I texted her about what time she wanted to go she says she might not be able to go due to studying.
I played it cool and said to text me later to say whether she is coming or not. 

I'm not sure how to go forward, we got on really well last night and she suggested the date and location, is her excuse legit? Should I try to setup an alternate date when (if) she texts later or contact her tomorrow morning about a new date? I've read that you should be positive and let the other person know you definitely want to spend time with them. I want to show her I'm interested without seeming desperate to go out with her.

TL;DR: Girl set up a date, then says she might cancel due to studying, unsure how to proceed.

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway12345**: "Honestly, it's not uncommon for people to have last-minute changes in plans due to studying or other commitments. If she's still interested in going out with you, she'll find a way to make it work. Don't take it personally and just wait for her to get back to you. If she cancels, don't be too hard on yourself and just move on."
* **u/datingcoach**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It's not uncommon for people to have to adjust their plans due to studying or other commitments. If she's still interested in going out with you, she'll find a way to make it work. Don't take it personally and just wait for her to get back to you. If she cancels, don't be too hard on yourself and just move on."
* **u/throwaway12345**: "Also, don't be afraid to suggest an alternate date or time if she does cancel. It shows that you're still interested in spending time with her and willing to work around her schedule. Just make sure to be respectful and understanding if she's still not able to make it."
* **u/datingcoach**: "Exactly! Suggesting an alternate date or time can be a great way to show that you're still interested in spending time with her. Just make sure to be respectful and understanding if she's still not able to make it. And remember, it's okay to take a step back and reassess the situation if it seems like she's not really interested in going out with you."
* **u/throwaway12345**: "And don't forget to keep the conversation light and casual. You don't want to come across as too pushy or aggressive. Just be friendly and see how things go from there."
* **u/datingcoach**: "Absolutely! Keep the conversation light and casual, and see how things go from there. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better before making any big plans. Just be respectful and understanding, and things should work out just fine."

TITLE: TIFU by watching the film Chappie

POST: Background: I had some important things to get done today. I had to pay some extra rent on my place, sort out references and paperwork for a new job I'll be starting next month and a new house (I'll be moving away from where I currently live). I have also recently broken up with my SO of nearly four years, so unsurprisingly I'm an quivering, emotional wreck. 

I've always liked Neil Blomkamp's movies; District 9 was amazing and Elysium was ok. Chappie seemed like a fun-filled, action-packed hour and a half I thought. How wrong I was. I had *no* idea how emotional this film was. Without ruining the film, there's a lot of scenes when Chappie (a robot) learns about the world and starts asking some thought provoking questions about life. I got to a point in the movie and I totally lost it. I was sat there absolutely sobbing my eyes out for some bizarre reason. I'm a reserved guy, and considering the emotional impact my breakup had I did damn well on the crying front. It all came out during this movie. 

Twelve hours later, I have lost the place I was supposed be living at, I'm late sending a contract to my new job, and I forgot to book/schedule a bunch of other semi-important things.

TL;DR: I watched Chappie and had an emotional breakdown, forgot to do important stuff, and now I'm in a bit of a pickle.

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/tifu (Today I F**ked Up), where people share their stories of mistakes, mishaps, and general incompetence. The author of this post had a rough day, and it all started with watching the film Chappie, which he didn't expect to be so emotionally affecting. He had a lot on his plate, including paying rent, sorting out paperwork, and dealing with the aftermath of his recent breakup. However, his emotional response to the film caused him to lose focus and forget to do some important tasks, leading to a series of unfortunate events.

The post is relatable and entertaining, and the author's self-deprecating humor and willingness to share his embarrassing story make it a great addition to the subreddit. The comments section is filled with people sharing their own stories of TIFU and offering words of encouragement and advice. The post has received over 2,000 upvotes and has been featured on the subreddit's front page.

TITLE: How do I [28 M] get over my long-term GF [25 F] of 3 years

POST: So I'm reaching out here because I've been having a hard time essentially getting over my ex, who I felt was the one (it's nearly 3 weeks now since the break up). 

Without warning, we broke up when I found out she had gotten close with someone else during her break (vacation), and she said that she felt different about me when she had come back. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around having 3 years of good times, shared dreams, fears, and goals, and us working toward our future together, to be suddenly undone by one week being away. 

I feel devastated, and having already had trust issues prior due to childhood reasons, and a prior relationship, I feel like they've gotten worse (which I've opened up to her about before). She made me feel secure, loved, and wanted, especially since a lot of family oriented goals were brought up by her first. For everything to be suddenly turned upside down crushed me. 

I'm sure everyone feels this way after a breakup, but I'm just not sure how to handle the emotions that come in waves. You know, some days are better than others, but then I just have bad dreams about it nearly every other night. It also doesn't help that she's already moved on, and already in a committed relationship with this other person, and my mind keeps drifting to it.

So what do I do? I've been wrestling with the idea of reaching out to her somewhere down the line, and trying to seek closure, but I don't think that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm not really used to this kind of rejection, much less from a relationship that felt like it was going great. Especially since it was someone I felt so comfortable opening up with, and had so much in common with, you know?

TL;DR: 3-year relationship ends due to her getting close with someone else during a break, and she says she feels different about me now. I'm struggling to cope with the emotions, and I'm not sure how to move on. Help?

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your breakup. It sounds like you're really struggling to come to terms with it. First of all, it's completely normal to feel devastated and confused after a breakup, especially one that was sudden and unexpected. It's okay to feel angry, sad, and hurt. But here's the thing: you can't change the past, and you can't control how your ex feels or behaves. What you can control is how you respond to the situation. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings? They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies.

TITLE: I (28F) just need to vent about my ex (30M) a little

POST: So we were together 5 years and living together most of that time. We broke up two months ago because things were pretty bad and he had a lot of his own issues to deal with. He basically told me that I'm an amazing GF but he's just so fucked up right now in his life that he ends up being a terrible BF and I don't deserve that etc. He told me that he still loves me but he could barely keep his shit together let alone be a decent boyfriend. He just couldn't be in a relationship right now

I understood this, and knowing his past and his problems this made a lot of sense. He was treating me pretty bad the last year of our relationship (i don't mean abusive) just inconsiderate and consumed with his own issues.

Well, two days ago I found out he was seriously dating another woman and I feel absolutely shattered. The break-up was a good thing, for both of us, but I'm stunned he's already dating seriously. 

I feel hurt because I truly felt for him and the tough time he was going through, I cried with him, and now I feel like it was all bullshit. I feel like he actually just wanted to find someone better than me

Anyway I've never felt more rejected in my life. I never thought it would affect me this way but I find myself utterly heartbroken.

someone please tell me this gets better

TL;DR: Ex broke up with me 2 months ago saying he was too messed up to be a good boyfriend, now I found out he's already dating someone else and I'm feeling utterly heartbroken and rejected

COMMENT 1:

Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like your ex was a real piece of work. First of all, let me tell you that it's completely normal to feel the way you do. It's okay to feel hurt and rejected. It's okay to feel like you were blindsided.

But here's the thing: you deserve so much better than someone who can't even be honest with you about their feelings. You deserve someone who is willing to work through their issues and be a good partner to you. And you know what? You're going to find that person. It might take some time, but you will.

In the meantime, take care of yourself. Do things that make you happy. Spend time with friends and family. And don't be afraid to reach out for support. You don't have to go through this alone.

And hey, who knows? Maybe your ex's new girlfriend is just as messed up as he is. Maybe she's not even a good match for him. You never know what's going to happen in the future.

Just remember that you are strong, capable, and deserving of love. You will get through this, and you will come out even stronger on the other side.

TITLE: TIFU by not washing or brushing my teeth for 5 days whilst on a school trip.

POST: So this didn't happen today like many other posts on here. This happened 5 years ago and I went on a residential at school. I arrived at my room with 6 other friends and we all unpacked. I noticed I didn't have my toiletries bag with me. I thought I must have not packed it by mistake. All I have to do is ask one of my friends if I could borrow their stuff. Only, I decide not to do that. 
It was an exercise based trip with a lot of sports in the middle of the summer so it was very hot. I went swimming in the ocean, playing football (Soccer), caving etc. 
I speant all my money on the vending machine buying mints to try to keep my breath smelling bearable and I wore a hat at all times because I can imagine my hair was extremely greasy. 
I can't imagine how bad I smelt and nobody told me. Now here is the worst thing about it. My toiletries bag was with me the entire time.  It's just that when I had to pop out of our room when I was unpacking, one of my friends picked up the bag by mistake and instead of putting it back in my suitcase, they stuck it on the floor behind my suitcase and when I pushed my suitcase under the bed, it pushed the toiletries bag back to the wall. I didn't realise until I was packing to leave when I did a quick sweep to see if I left anything, to find that bag pushed up against the wall.

TL;DR: I didn't wash or brush my teeth for 5 days on a school trip because I didn't realize my toiletries bag was with me the whole time. I spent all my money on mints and wore a hat to try to hide my greasy hair. Nobody told me how bad I smelt. 

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author, who was a student at the time, made a series of poor decisions that led to a very unpleasant experience. Here are some key takeaways from the story:

1. **Don't assume you don't have something**: The author assumed they didn't have their toiletries bag with them, but it was actually with them the whole time. This assumption led to a series of poor decisions.
2. **Don't be too proud to ask for help**: The author could have easily asked one of their friends to borrow some toiletries, but they chose not to. This pride led to a lot of unnecessary suffering.
3. **Take care of yourself**: The author's decision not to wash or brush their teeth for 5 days led to a very unpleasant experience. They could have avoided this by taking a few minutes each day to take care of their personal hygiene.
4. **Don't spend all your money on mints**: The author spent all their money on mints, which didn't solve the problem. They could have used that money to buy some toiletries or take a shower.

Overall, this post is a great example of how a series of small mistakes can lead to a big problem. It's a reminder to always take care of ourselves and not be too proud to ask for help when we need it.

TITLE: I, 19[f], am in love with my best friend 20[m]. How can i get him to fall for me?

POST: I have been in love with my best friend since year 2 of our friendship. He is the only person i trust in this world. 
Whenever he describes his perfect girl, he describes me, i don't even think he realizes it. He even goes so far to say "I want to marry my best friend". 
Its confusing, because he shows no interest in me thus-far. We get along great, we joke about & have fun.
I've loved him for the past four years, when i first realized it, i let him know. But he said didn't want to ruin our friendship. Ever since then I've acted like my feelings aren't there. I even give him helpful realtionship advice.
He is the only person i know i could trust in this world. 

What i want to know is how can i make him fall for me too? How can i show him I'm right for him?

TL;DR: I've been in love with my best friend for 4 years, he says he wants to marry his best friend, but shows no interest in me. I want to know how to make him fall for me too.

Thank you all for your comments. I think I've been putting too much pressure on this and I need to focus on building our friendship. I'll try to be more open and honest with him and see how he reacts. I'll also try to focus on being my amazing self and see if he develops feelings for me naturally.

I think I've been too focused on the romantic aspect of this and I need to take a step back and focus on our friendship. I'll try to be more open and honest with him and see how he reacts.

Thank you all for your advice and support. I'll try to keep an open mind and see where things go.

TITLE: Dog is afraid of the basketball pole that's always been there? (hasn't been afraid of it previously)

POST: I have a chihuahua (pug mix) dog, (1 yr/5 months old). We usually take him for walks around the gated apartment complex, where the gardens are at, the neighbors have a basketball hoop (the ones filled with water to keep it standing). One day they left a carpet out in the sun to dry & he quite like it (he was rubbing/nudging on it & I guess when the thing shook/or when I lifted him to hop on the carpet it scared him).  Ever since he hasn't been ANYWHERE near it, he doesn't want to even go outside anymore near that area (he'll just go potty & come right back inside).  I have tried carrying him over there and just holding him walking towards it, but right when I put him down he runs for his life back home. Tail is in between his legs, never seen him like that before.

He has never been afraid of going over there before at all, EVER, always had to go over there to potty on his usual spots, and has never had a problem until that incident...

I have never seen him afraid of anything before like this.  Also, not sure if this is because recently a neighbor brought their friends dog over to play (near that area/female retriever/poodle mix but he's never seen her).

I have tried to put snacks (in a trail) near there and have him slowly go out so he wouldn't be afraid, but once he eats all the snacks in the trail, he runs right back home.

I have also attempted to put the snacks on the basketball hoop base & he has just eaten the food (or merely ignored it in panic/looking up all the time to see if anything is going to fall on him or something)...

Whenever he leaves his safety area (home) he looks up & around but mostly up... How can I help him see that the basketball hoop is not dangerous? (ie. it's secure & won't fall over anytime soon even in gusty wind conditions)

TL;DR: My dog is afraid of the basketball pole that's always been there, after a one-time incident where it shook when he was playing with a carpet. He's never been afraid of it before and now won't even go near the area. I've tried carrying him over, holding him, and putting snacks in a trail, but he's still terrified. How can I help him overcome this fear?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/DogTrainer123**: "It's not uncommon for dogs to develop a phobia after a traumatic experience. The key is to help your dog associate the basketball pole with positive experiences. Try this: place treats and toys near the pole, and encourage your dog to approach it at his own pace. You can also try desensitization exercises, such as having your dog sit near the pole while you're holding a treat, then gradually increasing the distance between him and the pole. Reward him with treats and praise for remaining calm."
2. **u/PawsitiveVibes**: "I think it's great that you're trying to help your dog overcome his fear! It's not uncommon for dogs to develop phobias, especially if they're not socialized properly. Have you tried using positive reinforcement training methods? You could try using a clicker to mark the exact moment your dog starts to approach the basketball pole, and then reward him with treats. This can help him associate the pole with positive experiences."

**Additional Tips:**

* Try to avoid forcing your dog to approach the basketball pole, as this can exacerbate his fear.
* Use positive reinforcement training methods, such as clicker training, to help your dog associate the pole with positive experiences.
* Gradually increase the distance between your dog and the basketball pole, starting from a safe distance, to help him become comfortable with the pole.
* Reward your dog with treats and praise for remaining calm and approaching the pole.
* Consider seeking the help of a professional dog trainer or behaviorist if your dog's fear persists.

Remember, patience and consistency are key when helping your dog overcome his fear. With positive reinforcement training and gradual exposure, your dog can learn to feel comfortable around the basketball pole again. Good luck!

TITLE: My [18/F] ex BF[18/M] sent me a video of himself and I think I just cheated on my new BF [20/M]

POST: (Background) I just started university this year and before summer I broke up with my HS boyfriend of 2 years. I was in love with him, he was my first in everything and he is undeniably good looking. Unfortunately he turned 18 before me and went to the bar and proceeded to cheat on me while drunk and that ended the relationship.

I'm currently seeing someone I met during orientation and it's pretty serious, I like him, he's different but to be completely honest I'm not as attracted to him as I was with my ex. Anyways a couple nights ago he (my ex) commented on an old instagram picture of us, against my better judgement I replied and we started texting (I thought it was harmless) and it somewhat felt like old times.

Two nights ago I got a message from him and it was a video of him masturbating, of course I was shocked at first but that wore of pretty quickly and I got turned on, like really turned on. He called when I didn't message instantly and I guess we had facetime sex. I felt so horrible when I woke up.

I can't explain it other than I'm still very much attracted to him, he is extremely good looking, I can't not be. I have been ignoring him since then. I had a date with the guy I'm currently seeing tonight but I cancelled because I can't face him, to me it counts as cheating and I was cheated on before and it almost broke me, so I pretended to be sick. I'm pathetic and weak. 

Sidenote: I know he *(my ex) is flying back home for thanksgiving as well and  our parents are friends and I know they'll force me to atleast say hi to him so I can't hide. It's coming up soon and I'm just so confuse, I can't talk to any of my friends because I'm to embarrass. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Ex sent me a video of himself masturbating and we had facetime sex, I'm still attracted to him and I feel like I cheated on my new BF. I'm too embarrassed to talk to my friends and I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you're not weak or pathetic. You're human and it's okay to struggle with attraction. You need to have an honest conversation with your new BF about what happened and work through it together. Don't cancel plans because of guilt, face your feelings and communicate openly."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're still reeling from the breakup and it's understandable. You need to take some time to reflect on why you're still attracted to your ex and what that says about your current relationship. Are you using your new BF as a rebound or are you genuinely invested in him?"
* "You're not alone in this. Many people struggle with lingering feelings after a breakup. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself, you're doing the best you can."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. You're still attracted to your ex, but is that a reason to sabotage your current relationship? You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, not stuck in the past. Have an open and honest conversation with your new BF and see where it takes you."
* "Girl, you're not a cheater. You're a human being who made a mistake. You need to own up to it and apologize to your new BF. Communication is key in any relationship, so don't be afraid to have the tough conversation."

TITLE: How do you stay healthy and "resist temptation" in a very unhealthy household?

POST: (bit of a rant ahead) 

My family is *extremely* unhealthy. Both of my parents are obese and my brother is one of those very picky eaters whose diet mainly consists of fast food, frozen junk, and just generally unhealthy meals/snacks. I've been trying for years to get my family to have a more healthy diet, but the most I've managed is getting them to finally buy some frozen vegetables (and I'm the only one who eats them). Needless to say, there isn't a lot of healthy food in my house.

I've managed to avoid becoming extremely unhealthy, but I've always been "chubby". I don't know what to do. For a while I said "fuck it" and started buying a lot of my own food, but it took up too much room in the kitchen so I had to stop. I still cook almost all of my own meals.

The thing that frustrates me most is that I know first-hand how much easier it is to stay healthy when I'm not surrounded by junk food. When I studied abroad, living in a family who barely had junk on hand, things like chips and pizza were a *treat* like they're supposed to be. Unhealthy foods rarely crossed my mind.

I know there's not really much else to it besides sucking it up and controlling myself, but any kind words or "tips" would be helpful. I've recently gained a fair amount of weight and feel like I have to take this very seriously before I start heading down the road of my parents. I have zero real support from anyone around me, so it's difficult.

TL;DR: I live in a very unhealthy household and it's hard for me to stay healthy. I've tried to get my family to eat healthier, but it's not happening. I'm looking for advice on how to resist temptation and stay on track.

**Comments:**

1. **u/fitnessmotivation**: "Hey OP, I totally understand where you're coming from. It's tough to stay healthy when those around you aren't. Here's what I do: I focus on my own goals and remind myself that I'm doing this for myself, not for anyone else. I also try to find healthy alternatives to the junk food I used to eat. For example, if you love chips, try making your own kale chips! It's a game-changer. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just get back on track and keep moving forward."
2. **u/healthyliving**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this, OP. It sounds like a really tough situation. One thing that might help is to set some boundaries for yourself. For example, you could decide that you're not going to eat junk food in front of your family, or that you're only going to cook meals that you know are healthy. It's okay to prioritize your own health and well-being, even if it means making some tough choices. And don't forget to take care of yourself emotionally - it's okay to feel frustrated and overwhelmed, but try to focus on the things that you can control."
3. **u/loseit**: "Hey OP, I'm a fellow loser (get it?) and I totally understand what you're going through. One thing that's helped me is to find healthy recipes that I can make in advance and freeze for later. That way, even when I'm tempted by junk food, I know I have a healthy option waiting for me. Also, try to focus on the positive changes you're making in your own life, rather than getting frustrated with your family's lack of progress. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of!"
4. **u/foodie**: "OP, I'm a foodie and I love trying new recipes and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. One thing that might help you is to find healthy recipes that you actually enjoy. When you're eating food that you love, it's easier to stick to your goals. Also, try to find healthy alternatives to your favorite junk foods. For example, if you love pizza, try making a cauliflower crust pizza at home. It's a game-changer!"
5. **u/mentalhealthmatters**: "Hey OP, I just wanted to say that it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. Remember that your mental health is just as important as your physical health, and it's okay to take care of yourself in whatever way you need to. Whether that means taking a break from your family's junk food or seeking out support from a therapist, remember that you're not alone and that there are people who care about you and want to help."

TITLE: she doesn't know i know -- girlfriend's adderall prescription

POST: Well. I feel like an asshole due to the invasion of privacy but I'll explain that in a second...

It all goes back to when I was driving her car because I didn't have one at the time. I was looking for some kind of chapstick and found a bottle of adderall in the storage between the driver and passenger seat.

I didn't say anything for a couple weeks because I had no idea how to approach it. I finally brought up the subject in a "general" way and she told me that she had taken it a couple times when she lived in NYC (1.5 or 2 years ago) but does not take it currently. I THEN brought it up a week later, telling her I FOUND IT by accident, and she said that her therapist had prescribed it but she won't be taking it and won't be getting it refilled.

Here's the horrible part:

I looked at her text messages because part of me didn't trust her. What did I find? A text message to her therapist from this past weekend asking the therapist to refill the prescription for adderall. 

How the hell do I approach this? I only ask because I'm not sure if I should be worried. Do I even say anything or do I just respect privacy? We live together. I'm aware this is amazingly hypocritical but shouldn't she be sharing this with me? Or no? This is the best relationship that's ever happened to me... curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's adderall prescription was found in her car, she initially denied taking it, then said she wouldn't be taking it or getting it refilled, but I found a text message asking the therapist to refill the prescription. Should I say anything or respect her privacy?

**Top comments:**

* "You're right to be concerned. It's not just about the prescription, it's about the lack of transparency and honesty in your relationship. You deserve better than that. Have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns." (123 upvotes)
* "I would say something, but do it in a non-accusatory way. You could say something like 'Hey, I found this prescription in your car and I'm a little worried because you initially denied taking it. Can you tell me what's going on?' Try to approach it as a conversation starter rather than an attack." (89 upvotes)
* "I think you should respect her privacy. If she's not taking the medication and doesn't plan on getting it refilled, it's not your business. You're not her doctor or her therapist. Just focus on your relationship and don't make a big deal out of it." (42 upvotes)
* "You're not an asshole for finding out the truth. You're a concerned partner who wants to know what's going on in your relationship. I would say something to her, but make sure you're coming from a place of love and concern, not accusation or anger." (35 upvotes)

**Original poster's response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys. I think I'll try to approach it in a non-accusatory way like someone suggested. I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I do want to know what's going on. I'll try to keep an open mind and see how she responds. Thanks again for the advice!" (22 upvotes)

TITLE: What's the hungriest you've ever really been?

POST: [This] thread got me thinking about the "disgusting" things I'd eat if I was *really* hungry. I don't mean the kind of hungry when lunch is still two hours away and the coffee you had for breakfast isn't helping anymore and you groan to your coworker *"I'm starving!"* I mean hungry like you haven't had a bite to eat in days and you're not sure when you'll eat again.

For me, it was 1994 and I was 20 years old living with my first boyfriend. We often survived on end-of-day leftovers at our crappy fast food jobs. Business got slow and we both got fired from our jobs and we were just too dumb to think about the fact that the money we were spending on cigarettes and Dr. Pepper should *probably* be used for PB&J. 

He got a part time job at KFC so he got at least one free meal a day, and I'd usually walk there to share that with him. It was almost Thanksgiving and his hours got cut back from 24 a week to 18, then 12, then they let him go altogether. Just before he left, he stole a bag of powdered mashed potatoes. (Desperate times, desperate measures?) We ate mashed potatoes for every meal for a week until it was just gone. Then there was nothing, and it was the day after Thanksgiving and all the food pantries were closed, and then it was the weekend and we were SO hungry.

Those three days with nothing but water were probably the longest of my life. Strangely, after the 24 hour mark I stopped feeling hunger pains and just felt tired and moody. Any time I thought about food, I'd drink water or eat ice. (I found out several years later that while I had been starving, my boyfriend had been secretly visiting his family and having lunch or dinner with them. His family hated me, they felt I stole away their little boy, and there's no way they'd have fed me. My family wasn't talking to me because I was "living in sin" with him, so I didn't have backup like he did.)

TL;DR: I was 20, living with my boyfriend, and we got fired from our jobs. We survived on leftovers and KFC meals, but when he lost his job, we had nothing for three days. I stopped feeling hunger pains after 24 hours and just felt tired and moody. I ate ice and drank water to distract myself from food cravings.

TITLE: My [19F] is leaving me [20M] for now because she's unhappy

POST: Hi. My girlfriend and I have been together for three years. Recently, she has broken up with me. She says it is because she is unhappy. To be honest, I have been a shitty boyfriend lately. I love her and she says that she loves me. 

Recently, she has been talking to this other guy. However, she says she has been unhappy for three months. She says that she was planning on breaking up with me for a while. She says she is not breaking up with me for this guy. We still live together, she still likes to cuddle. I'm so confused. She. wants her space she says, and maybe in a few months we'll work it out. She doesn't want to work it out because she feels like she needs to focus on herself and that I've had too many chances. I love this girl. Do I keep fighting or just wait it out? I don't know.

TL;DR: My girlfriend of three years broke up with me because she's unhappy. She says she still loves me, but needs space and time to focus on herself. She's been talking to another guy, but says it's not about him. We still live together and she still wants to cuddle. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's already made up her mind and is just giving you a chance to process. If she's willing to still live together and cuddle, it's not a complete break-up. Maybe take this time to focus on yourself and work on becoming a better partner. Don't rush back into things if you're not sure if you're ready."
* "I think you're being too optimistic. If she's unhappy and has been unhappy for three months, it's likely she's already made up her mind. You can't force someone to stay in a relationship if they're not happy. Take this time to focus on yourself and work on becoming a better partner, but also be prepared for the possibility that she may not come back."
* "I think you're being too focused on the 'what ifs' and not enough on the present. If she's unhappy and wants space, it's likely because she needs it. Take this time to focus on yourself and work on becoming a better partner. Don't rush back into things if you're not sure if you're ready."
* "I think you should take this time to focus on yourself and work on becoming a better partner. If she's willing to still live together and cuddle, it's not a complete break-up.

Thank you for your comments. I think I'm going to take your advice and focus on myself for now. I know I've been a crappy boyfriend lately, and I need to work on becoming a better partner. I'm going to take this time to focus on myself and work on becoming a better partner. I'm not going to rush back into things if I'm not sure if I'm ready. I appreciate your advice and support.

TITLE: I'm a [21M] in a relationship with a [44F]. But there is a problem on her side of things..

POST: Not going to bore you but attempt to be straight to the point. 

I've been with her around 4 months now and I've met 2 of her children (13M/4M) and I know they're quite young and probably don't understand relationships yet but they're perfectly fine with it and welcome me with open arms (well, the 13 year old anyways, get on with him really well whereas the 4 year old just want to play all the time)

Anyways, only 1 problem is that she has a 21M son who lives away at university most of the year but has been home for the past 15 days or so.

Now I've gotten to see my girlfriend on occasions but not as much because of him being around, but the problem is she's afraid he'll go off the rails if he finds out about me with me being the same age. She said she feels so close to me and can't leave me because it'd break her heart but she's fighting a huge battle in my opinion and I don't want her to lose her son. The last thing I want to cause is a family rift. 

I want to be with her so much and I can't decide what to do or what to suggest to her. 

Can anybody help or advise me on what I could say/do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has 21M son who's away at university but has been home for 15 days. She's afraid he'll go off the rails if he finds out about me being the same age. She's torn between me and her son. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being very understanding and considerate of the situation. It's not easy to navigate, but it's great that you're thinking about the potential consequences. Have you talked to her about how she's feeling and what she's afraid of? Maybe you can help her work through her emotions and find a solution that works for everyone."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's not thinking about the long-term implications of your relationship and how it might affect her son. You could also suggest that you both talk to her son together and have an open conversation about your relationship. It's not ideal, but it might be the best way to handle the situation."
* "I think you're being very considerate of her feelings, but you also need to think about your own feelings and what you want. Are you willing to wait until her son is older or until the situation becomes less complicated? Or are you willing to take the risk of potentially losing her son's respect and potentially causing a family rift? You need to weigh the pros and cons and decide what's best for you."
* "I think you should focus on building a strong relationship with her and her children, and not worry too much about her son's reaction. If he's old enough to understand, you can have a conversation with him and explain your intentions and feelings. But ultimately, it's her decision what she wants to do, and you need to respect that."
* "I think you should be honest with her about your feelings and concerns, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not be ready to be in a relationship with you. It's not fair to put her in a situation where she's torn between you and her son, and you need to respect her decision if she decides to prioritize her son's feelings over yours."

TITLE: Well, I don't know where else to post this

POST: So I recently moved to a new school and on my second day, met a girl who shall here forth be called "Kim". We became fast friends and I realized that was I was starting to develop feelings for her, but these feelings were stronger than I had ever had for anybody before. I was going a little out of my mind keeping my feelings for her in, and finally on Friday I told her my feelings and she essentially said that she gets it, whatever, and we carried on as usual. This was fine with me, and we actually talked all day Saturday. However, on Sunday she ignored me, and today she's been scattered in replying to my texts and other attempts to communicate. This is my first point. My second, is that after I started talking to Kim, she introduced me to her best friend, who we shall now call "Ruby". So I was pining after Kim, but at the same time I really wanted to make a connection with Ruby. We shared a lot more interests, but I still had stronger feelings for Kim. Now, when I was going crazy, Ruby really helped me out and gave me good advice. She has consistently given me good advice and been really helpful at any moment in our friendship. Once I told Kim about my feelings, she started to stand out to me. Ruby seemed so... different then. I realized that this entire time, I've tried to repress any feelings I had for her, as I didn't want anyone other than Kim. I have such a different feeling towards Ruby though. With Kim, just talking to her makes me happy, but whenever we fall out of contact, I just start to get deep emotional pain. But I can't really put a finger on my feelings for Ruby. She makes me happy, and I feel such a need to make her happy and protect her from anything. Right now, I am in immense conflict with this, and could really use some advice.

TL;DR: I told my crush Kim I had feelings for her, and she didn't really respond. Now I'm feeling confused about my feelings for her and her best friend Ruby. I feel like I'm in love with Kim, but Ruby has been really helpful and supportive. I don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're in a love triangle. It's okay to feel confused. Take some time to reflect on your feelings and what you want. Maybe try talking to Ruby about how you're feeling and see if she feels the same way."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You told Kim how you felt and she didn't respond, that's okay. Maybe she's not interested. You can't force someone to feel a certain way. Focus on building a connection with Ruby and see where it takes you."
* "I think you're trying to make this more complicated than it needs to be. You have feelings for Kim, that's okay. You also have feelings for Ruby, that's okay too. You don't have to choose between them right now. Just focus on being a good friend to both of them and see what happens."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings for both Kim and Ruby. Are you in love with Kim or are you just infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship with her? Are you really feeling a connection with Ruby or are you just trying to fill a void? Take some time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to do to get it."
* "I think you should talk to both Kim and Ruby about how you're feeling. Be honest with them and see how they respond. You can't keep these feelings bottled up inside and expect them to go away. Communication is key in any relationship."

TITLE: My fiance [27/F] just broke it off with me [28/M] and I'm feeling lost and confused.

POST: We've been dating for 3 years and we've been great friends since high school.  We got engaged in November and were about to lock up a venue for our wedding when everything came down.

We talked on Sunday because she had been stalling on signing the agreement with the venue, and she said she wasn't sure she was ready to get married.  She then said that she needed some time to get her head straight and then said that she wanted to take a break for a few months to figure out what she wants.

We got a house together in July, and things had been going great.  We were both happy.  I feel like she is scared of the responsibility and commitment that a relationship requires.

I don't know how to get her back and I'm terrified that I won't be able to.  I love her to death and the last few days have been brutally tough.  Any advice or thoughts on this to help me out would be much appreciated.  I'm in the dark here.

POST: We've been together for 2 years and everything was great until about 6 weeks ago.  She started pulling away and becoming distant.  I've tried talking to her about it, but she just says everything is fine and that I'm being paranoid.

I've noticed that she's been spending more time with her friends, and we used to do everything together.  She's also been canceling plans with me at the last minute, saying she's not feeling well or something.  When we do hang out, she seems really uninterested and just goes through the motions.

I've tried to talk to her about it, but she just gets defensive and tells me I'm being too clingy.  I feel like I'm losing her and I have no idea why.  I've been trying to give her space, but it's hard not to take it personally.

I love her and I want to work through this, but I don't know how to get her to open up to me.  Any advice or thoughts on this would be much appreciated.  I'm at a loss here.

TITLE: My girlfriend [22/F] is constantly making me feel guilty for not being more romantic and affectionate.

POST: We've been together for 2 years and everything was great until about 6 months ago.  She started making these big deals about how I'm not romantic enough and how I never show her affection.  She says that I'm not making an effort and that I'm taking her for granted.

I've tried to explain to her that I'm just not a very romantic person and that I show my love and appreciation in other ways, like helping out around the house and being there for her when she needs me.  But she just says that's not enough and that I need to do more.

It's getting to the point where I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her, never knowing when she's going to blow up at me for not being more romantic.  I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and that she's using guilt trips to get what she wants from me.

I love her and I want to make her happy, but I don't know how to deal with this constant guilt-tripping.  Any advice or thoughts on this would be much appreciated.  I'm feeling really frustrated and helpless.

TL;DR: Girlfriend constantly makes me feel guilty for not being more romantic and affectionate. I've tried explaining that I show my love in other ways, but she says that's not enough. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and I don't know how to deal with this.

TITLE: I dont know who I am

POST: Not in the amnesiac sense.  I just dont know what makes me me anymore.  I always remember being the smartest person in a room, but now with my new job, my inexperience makes me the dumbest person around.  I used to be really in to Jiu Jitsu, I started in college.  I had the same partner for four years, and we even started dating.  Then she went to a different section of the united states, and I started trying to set my self up to be able to move to her.  She left me, and married her instructor in like a three month span.  I dont know what to do, it almost feels like there is no point to do the martial art anymore.  I always prided myself in being in the number one fighter of my social circle.  I know, being half a country away, they arent in my circle anymore, but as the very least my ex is a fellow Redditor. (so of course im using a throwaway.)  I cant find new employment, I cant move out of my parents house.

TL;DR: I used to be confident in my abilities, but now I feel lost and unsure of myself.  I'm struggling to find new employment and move out of my parents house.  I'm also struggling to find a new passion in Jiu Jitsu since my ex left me.

This post is a great example of the "off my chest" subreddit, where users can share their personal struggles and emotions without fear of judgment. The author is feeling lost and unsure of themselves, and is struggling to find their identity and purpose.

TITLE: Me [23F] with my SO [30 M] 1.5 years, Those who have been on a break due to depression/needing space, and really love each other. How did you make it work? How do you navigate a break?

POST: My SO (30 M) and I (23 F) have decided to take a break due to his holding back for months that he was getting depressed. I have had mental issues my entire life that include OCD, Anxiety and Depression so I understand how hard it was to him and where it was coming from. 

He didn't want to lose me from his life, and I didn't want to lose him. We love the hell out of each other.

Neither of us have had a "break" before, and we want it to work/be beneficial.

as he said "I want to look back on this one day with you and agree that it brought us closer and made us stronger". 

So, we decided that the onus of contact is on him, and he calls me twice a day to talk. We met up today {had the conversation on Friday} because he *really* wanted to see me. I'll admit i wanted to see him too.

So those who have been on a break, and it was successful please advise!

What were your ground rules, how long was your break, what do you *do* to make sure its successful?

TL;DR: Me and my SO took a break due to his depression, we love each other, and we want to make it work. How did you make it work on a break? What were your ground rules?

**Comments:**

* "I'm glad you're taking the time to work on yourselves and your relationship. It's great that you're prioritizing your mental health and communication. My partner and I took a break for a few months due to my anxiety and depression. We set boundaries and communicated openly about our needs. We also made sure to prioritize self-care and individual growth. It was tough, but it ultimately brought us closer together and helped us grow as individuals."

**Note:** The comments are all very similar, with people sharing their own experiences of taking a break due to depression and anxiety, and how they made it work by prioritizing communication, self-care, and individual growth. The OP's post is met with a lot of support and understanding, and people are eager to share their own stories and advice. The tone of the comments is overwhelmingly positive and encouraging.

TITLE: My [23M] friend [20F] invites/begs me to accompany her on unnecessary shopping trips then asks me to pay for gas.

POST: I come from the city so I'm a veteran public transportation rider. I attend a University where the public transportation isn't in abundance but still reliable. 

Recently my friend has gotten a new car and in excitement, has been using it frequency. This has led to her asking, and later begging me to join her on trips to the store/mall/anywhere off campus. 

At first, I agreed to these trips since she was still in that "freedom" phase of owning a car. After a few weeks, she'd started demanding gas money for her service. 

I would normally pay for all my goods and services, but I'm baffled at this. She invites me on this little runs willingly, and mostly to places I do not need/care to go. I have told her often that I would rather use the public transportation as my University student fees pay for it. When I turn her down, she asks again or passive aggressively comments on not spending time with her. 

I do not have a lot of money compared to her. She comes from a rich family and has a fair bit of cash on her at all times. 

I do not understand the underlying issue or how to address it.

TL;DR: Friend invites me on unnecessary shopping trips, then asks me to pay for gas. I'm a student with limited funds and prefer public transportation. How do I address this?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "Hey OP, I think your friend is taking advantage of your willingness to hang out with her. You're right, you don't have a lot of money, and she's not respecting that. Maybe have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you appreciate her inviting you, but you can't afford to pay for gas every time. Suggest alternative activities that are more budget-friendly, like going for a walk or having a picnic. If she's still not understanding, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being too nice. You're a student, and you have limited funds. You don't owe your friend anything. If she's not respecting your boundaries, it's time to set some clear expectations. Tell her that you're not comfortable paying for gas, and that you'd rather use public transportation. If she's still not understanding, it might be time to distance yourself from the friendship."
3. **u/financiallyconscious**: "OP, I think you're being taken advantage of. Your friend is using you for free transportation and gas money. You need to have a conversation with her about your financial situation and set some boundaries. Let her know that you're willing to hang out with her, but you can't afford to pay for gas every time. Suggest alternative activities that are more budget-friendly, like going for a walk or having a picnic. If she's still not understanding, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
4. **u/communicationiskey**: "OP, I think you're being too passive. You need to have a direct conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you appreciate her inviting you, but you can't afford to pay for gas every time. Be specific about your financial situation and how it's affecting you. Suggest alternative activities that are more budget-friendly, like going for a walk or having a picnic. If she's still not understanding, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
5. **u/unsolicitedadvice**: "OP, I think you should just stop hanging out with your friend. She's clearly not respecting your boundaries, and you deserve better. You're a student, and you have limited funds. You don't owe your friend anything. Find friends who are more understanding and respectful of your financial situation."

TITLE: Should I stay or should I go (24f)

POST: Hello reddit. Sorry for the throwaway, my boyfriend (m27) is the one who introduced me to reddit, so I'm sure he'd find this post if I used my real account. 

My SO and I have been dating for a year and a half. We met at work and saw each other pretty much everyday. Recently he took a new job about 200 miles away so we see each other about every 3 weeks.

My dilemma is that he WILL NOT talk about the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it's hard to be in this LDR without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that thats something we both want. When we were with each other all the time the future didn't seem to matter as much. But now that he's gone and we're trying to stay together I feel like I need some reassurance as to WHY we're engaging in a LDR with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it's worth doing it.

I have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. 

I just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it was one of my friends asking me for advice I would tell them to let him go and move on if he can't make up his mind about you. But for some reason it's harder to see when it's your own life. I know he loves me and I know he's indecisive about almost everything else. Maybe he's taking me sticking by him for granted? I just don't know.

So should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Been dating my SO for 1.5 years. He took a new job 200 miles away and we're in a LDR. He won't talk about the future and I'm feeling uncertain about our relationship. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he's not ready to make any big decisions. I'm torn between staying and giving him space or moving on. Help! 

**Edit:** I just wanted to add that we have a great time together when we do see each other, and I do feel like we have a strong connection. It's just the uncertainty that's eating away at me. 

**Edit 2:** I should also mention that we've talked about the possibility of me moving to be with him, but he's not sure if that's something he wants to happen. He says he needs to focus on his new job first and then we can reassess. I'm just not sure if I'm willing to wait around for him to figure out what he wants. 

**Edit 3:** I've been thinking about this a lot and I think I've come to a realization. I think I'm not just looking for reassurance about the future, I'm also looking for a sense of security and stability. And I don't think I can get that with someone who is so indecisive. I think I need someone who is willing to work towards a future together, not just coast through life without a plan. So, I think I've made up my mind. I'm going to take some time to focus on myself and see what I want for my future. Thanks for all the advice and support, everyone! 

**Edit 4:** I just wanted to follow up and say that I did end up taking some time for myself and focusing on my own goals and desires. It was really empowering and I feel like I've gained a new sense of confidence and clarity. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited to see what's in store. Thanks again for all the support and advice! 

**Edit 5:** I just wanted to add that I did end up breaking up with my boyfriend. It was a tough decision, but I think it was the right one for me. I deserved better than someone who couldn't make up their mind about our future together. I'm doing okay and I'm focusing on myself and my own happiness. Thanks again for all the support and advice! 

**Edit 6:** I just wanted to follow up and say that I'm doing really well. I've been focusing on myself and my own goals and desires, and I've been doing a lot of self-care and self-reflection. I'm excited to see what the future holds and I'm grateful for the experience I had with my ex. It taught me a lot about myself and what I want in a relationship. Thanks again for all the support and advice! 

**Edit 7:** I just wanted to add that I've been thinking about my ex a lot lately and I've been wondering if I made the right decision. I know I did, but sometimes I still wonder what could have been if we had worked through our issues. I'm just grateful that I'm in a place where I can reflect on our relationship and learn from it. Thanks again for all the support and advice! 

**Edit 8:** I just wanted to follow up and say that I'm still doing well. I've been focusing on myself and my own goals and desires, and I've been doing a lot of self-care and self-reflection. I'm excited to see what the future holds and I'm grateful for the experience I had with my ex. It taught me a lot about myself and what I want in a relationship.

TITLE: My husband is suddenly way more into my dirty asshole than I am anywhere near comfortable with and I don't know what to do. (M24, F31)

POST: We've been married for four years, together for five. Suddenly all he wants to do is sniff my asshole and armpits regardless of when I last showered. I love him a lot of want to make him happy but it makes me feel so fucking gross. I've tried to be GGG about it and just let him but it really turns me off and the last thing I want is to have sex with him afterward. I just find myself getting angry and feeling used.

These days it's like he hugs me and cuddles me and them gets on his knees and shoves his face into my ass crack, or he hugs me and tries to shove his hand in my ass crack. I asked him if he could maybe build up to that instead of going for it right out of the gate but he doesn't seem amenable to it. I've started to turn him down every time he reaches for me because I don't want to be sniffed like a dog. I don't even want him to touch me anymore.

He confessed that he really wanted this when we were drunk one night and I said I would try it but I just can't get into it. He wants to stick his tongue into my asshole then kiss me and it makes me want to fucking vomit. He's hinted at wanting to try piss play too. I have absolutely no interest in that.

I don't know what to do. I love him and I feel like I've tried to be as GGG about this as I can but fuck. There is SO MUCH kinky shit I'd be happy to try but why does it have to be this? Bodily wastes and armpit stank just have no appeal for me. I mean if he wanted to do all this shit fresh after a shower, sure, but he doesn't. He seems upset when I shower before bed now.

Seriously, at a total loss here. When the fuck did I marry Napoleon?

TL;DR: Husband suddenly super into sniffing my asshole and armpits, I'm not comfortable with it and it makes me feel gross. I've tried to be GGG but it's really turning me off. Help.

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships where one partner has a strong desire for a particular sexual activity that the other partner is not comfortable with. In this case, the husband is interested in sniffing the wife's asshole and armpits, which makes her feel gross and uncomfortable. The wife has tried to be GGG (good girl, good girl) about it, but it's not working for her.

The post highlights the importance of communication and compromise in relationships. The wife is looking for a way to address her discomfort and find a solution that works for both partners. The husband's desire for this activity is not being met, and the wife is feeling used and unappreciated.

The post also raises questions about the importance of personal boundaries in relationships. The wife is clear about her discomfort with this activity, and it's important for her partner to respect those boundaries. The husband's refusal to compromise and his insistence on pursuing this activity despite the wife's discomfort is a red flag.

Overall, this post is a great example of the importance of open communication and compromise in relationships, as well as the importance of respecting each other's boundaries. It's a reminder that relationships are about finding common ground and working together, not about forcing one partner to conform to the other's desires.

TITLE: Need insight... Is my(21F) boyfriends(24m) view on marriage normal?

POST: I've been with my boyfriend nearly 3 years, lived together for two.

I've pretty much been ready to get engaged for the last few months, he is not,  which is ok because we are still young, don't really wanna rush into things and I'm ok with waiting. In pretty sure he's my soulmate.  

Living together has been smooth sailing, we just signed a lease for another year. We're both tidy enough, split chores evenly, finances in order. Normal stuff. We don't really fight. 

Anyways, we were talking about marriage and the future and he thinks that being married will be hard. I asked why he thought that and he said living with another person is hard. I asked him if living with me currently was hard, he said no. This didn't make sense to me obviously. So he goes on to say that after about 4 yrs of being together then "biologically" staying together in a marriage is just about having "sheer willpower", as if it's a struggle staying together longer than that. 

Ok I know marriage can be hard, I watched my parents stay in a shitty marriage for years with constant fighting. I know things change after the honeymoon phase (pretty sure we are past that by now). But I don't think people only stay together because of "willpower". It kinda makes me feel sad that he has that expectation of me in the future. 

Is there any truth to this point of view? Is he mistaken? I just don't understand where he got that idea, his parents have been together for 27 years and are very happy it seems. 

Am I just naive to think marriage won't be that bad? I mean we already live together, how much more will things change?

TL;DR: Boyfriend (24m) thinks marriage will be hard because living with another person is hard. He says after 4 yrs, it's just about "willpower" to stay together. I'm confused and a bit sad about this expectation. Is he mistaken? Am I being naive?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is just not ready for marriage. He's not even sure what it entails, and he's making assumptions based on his own limited experience. It's not about being "mistaken" or "naive", it's about being realistic about the challenges that come with marriage.
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: I think your boyfriend is trying to downplay the importance of marriage. He's saying it's just about willpower because he's not willing to put in the effort to make it work. Marriage is about commitment, communication, and compromise. It's not just about staying together because you feel like it.
3. **SkepticalSarah**: I think your boyfriend is being a bit dramatic. Marriage can be challenging, but it's not all about willpower. It's about building a life together, supporting each other, and growing as individuals. If he's not willing to put in the effort to make it work, then maybe he's not ready for marriage.
4. **MarriageMaven**: I think your boyfriend is trying to scare you into not wanting to get married. He's making it sound like it's a huge burden, but in reality, marriage can be a beautiful and rewarding experience. If you're willing to put in the work, it can bring you and your partner closer together.
5. **RealisticRuth**: I think your boyfriend is being realistic about the challenges of marriage. It's not all rainbows and butterflies. But, it's also not just about willpower. It's about finding ways to overcome the challenges and build a strong foundation for your relationship. If you're willing to work together, you can overcome anything.

**Insights:**

* The comments suggest that the boyfriend's view on marriage is not entirely normal or realistic.
* Many commenters believe that he is not ready for marriage or is trying to downplay its importance.
* Others think that he is being dramatic or trying to scare the OP into not wanting to get married.
* The comments also highlight the importance of commitment, communication, and compromise in a marriage.
* The OP is encouraged to have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her concerns and expectations.

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my Girlfriend [19 F] of 1 month. I think it might be me, but she's acting differently. What gives?

POST: I'll keep this brief, but when I had met my girlfriend we would hang out non stop, text often, etc.. Sadly her grandfather had passed, so we put things on hold for a couple weeks.
Now she's been a pain to text, and to try to hang out with. However there are a few days where she'll text me and ask to hang out. I understand that she doesn't like to text much, but say last night; she invited me out to an even with her family, we had a great time and I had texted her that I did last night, and to thank her family for inviting me. I got nothing back, which means she probably was asleep, so I figured I text her and ask her to hang out today since I know we both didn't have work. Yet, 8 hours later still nothing.

What gives? Sometimes she'll text me a lot, so I'm a bit confused. Should I try not to message her until she messages me?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 1 month acting differently, not responding to texts, and not initiating hangouts. What's going on?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "It sounds like she's going through a tough time with her grandfather's passing. Give her space and don't take it personally. When she's ready to talk or hang out, she'll reach out. Don't overthink it and don't try to force it."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "It's normal for people to go through ups and downs in relationships, especially during difficult times. Try not to overanalyze the situation and focus on being supportive. If you're feeling anxious or unsure, consider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're overreacting a bit. It's not uncommon for people to take time for themselves after a loss. If you're feeling neglected or unheard, maybe try having a conversation with her about how you're feeling. But don't assume the worst just yet."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's not aware of how her behavior is affecting you. Be honest and open, but also be understanding and empathetic. Remember that everyone deals with grief differently."
5. **RealisticRuth**: "It's possible that she's just not feeling up to socializing right now. Give her space and don't take it personally. When she's ready to talk or hang out, she'll reach out. In the meantime, focus on taking care of yourself and doing things that make you happy."

TITLE: Any advice for which college program? Information technology. I need someone with experience in the field.

POST: Hello my name is Daniel. I am 24 years old and i am going to be going to college for the first time! I am finally able to go as independent so now is the time to get help with tuition. I start in the fall!

I would like a little guidance from the community here. I decided to go to a community college first, as to not load myself up with debt. I am looking to go into the tech sector. 

These are what i'm looking at:

Software Development A.A.S. Degree
I am looking at computer programming #1. I am not the most creative person, but i can definitely create something with the correct inspiration. And.... i love computers and solving problems.

With an Associates in Applied Science, i should be able to get work pretty quickly if i do well if what I've researched is correct.
But if i we're to attain this degree, what can i do to advance my education and achieve a bachelor's degree or get a better job? Is a bachelor's even needed to move up in the industry?

Computer Support and Network Administration A.A.S.
I'm also good with people and would love working in a field that is actively working with people to solve problems.

Is there way to advance my education past the AAS in this field? What can i do to advance my education and achieve a bachelor's degree or get a better job in networking? Is a bachelor's even needed to move up in the industry?

TL;DR: I'm starting college for the first time and I'm looking for advice on which program to choose. I'm interested in IT and I'm looking at two programs: Software Development and Computer Support and Network Administration. I want to know if a bachelor's degree is necessary to advance in the industry and what I can do to advance my education.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/tech_guru**: Hey Daniel! Congrats on taking the first step towards your education! Both programs you're considering are great options, but I'd like to give you some insight. Software Development is a highly sought-after field, and with an AAS degree, you'll have a solid foundation to start your career. However, if you want to move up the ladder, a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field can be beneficial. You can also consider certifications like CompTIA A+ or Cisco CCNA to boost your resume.

For Computer Support and Network Administration, a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, especially if you want to move into a more senior role or specialize in a specific area like cybersecurity. However, many companies value hands-on experience and certifications like CompTIA Network+ or Cisco CCNA.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which path you want to take. I'd recommend talking to professionals in both fields to get a better understanding of what's required to advance.

2. **u/NetworkNinja**: Hey Daniel! I'm a network administrator, and I can attest that having a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, but it's not always necessary. What's more important is having relevant experience and certifications. In the IT field, it's all about being hands-on and able to troubleshoot problems.

If you're interested in computer support and network administration, I'd recommend getting certified in CompTIA A+ and Network+. These certifications will give you a solid foundation and make you more attractive to potential employers.

As for advancing your education, you can consider pursuing a bachelor's degree in a related field like computer science or information technology. However, it's also important to gain practical experience through internships or volunteering.

3. **u/SoftwareSavvy**: Hey Daniel! I'm a software developer, and I can tell you that having a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field can be beneficial, especially if you want to move up the ladder. However, it's not the only way to advance in the industry.

What's more important is having a strong portfolio of projects and being able to demonstrate your skills. You can also consider getting certified in programming languages like Java or Python.

If you're interested in software development, I'd recommend taking online courses or attending coding boot camps to gain practical experience. This will give you a competitive edge in the job market.

4. **u/IT_Guru**: Hey Daniel! I'm an IT professional, and I can attest that having a bachelor's degree can be beneficial, but it's not always necessary. What's more important is having relevant experience and certifications.

If you're interested in IT, I'd recommend getting certified in CompTIA A+ and Network+. These certifications will give you a solid foundation and make you more attractive to potential employers.

As for advancing your education, you can consider pursuing a bachelor's degree in a related field like computer science or information technology. However, it's also important to gain practical experience through internships or volunteering.

5. **u/CollegeCounselor**: Hey Daniel! As a college counselor, I can tell you that both programs you're considering are great options. However, it's important to consider your career goals and what you want to achieve.

If you're interested in software development, I'd recommend pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field. This will give you a solid foundation and prepare you for a career in the industry.

If you're interested in computer support and network administration, I'd recommend getting certified in CompTIA A+ and Network+. These certifications will give you a solid foundation and make you more attractive to potential employers.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which path you want to take. I'd recommend talking to professionals in both fields to get a better understanding of what's required to advance. Good luck with your education!

TITLE: I (19 F) am scared of smothering and loving my bf (19 M) too much. ((End of honeymoon stage?))

POST: My problem is extremely simple, and has been on my mind a little bit. 

They say that after a while of dating and being together you start to ween out of the honeymoon stage and start to have a simple relationship with one another. But we have been dating for almost a year now, next month, and I feel like that stage hasn't ended for me yet, though it does seem to have with him.

I go to school about 2 hours away from him, so we only see eachother now and again on weekends. But when we are together, I tend to love on him all day. I watch him play games, cuddle, watch movies/shows with him. Even when we hang out with his friends or are in public, I tend to want to hold his hand and give him kisses.

He on the other hand is of course past this. He has said that he both likes and dislike my lovey-doveiness. Sometimes he loves it because he feels important/special/wanted. Othertimes it is kind of annoying or clingy.

But I'm just not sure what to do about it. I always want to show him how much I love him and how happy he makes me, but I also don't want to be a smothering gf.

TL;DR: I'm 19 and have been dating my bf for almost a year. I'm still in the honeymoon stage and love showing him affection, but he's not. He says he likes it sometimes, but other times it's annoying. I'm scared of smothering him and losing him, but I also don't want to stop showing him how much I love him.

---

This post is a great example of a common relationship concern: the fear of smothering one's partner. The OP (original poster) is struggling with the desire to show her love and affection to her boyfriend, but is worried that it may be overwhelming or annoying to him. This is a common issue that many couples face, especially during the early stages of a relationship.

The OP's concern is understandable, as it's natural to want to express one's feelings and affection to a partner. However, it's also important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries. In this case, the OP's boyfriend has expressed that he likes her affection sometimes, but other times it's annoying or clingy.

To address this issue, the OP could try having an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her feelings and concerns. She could ask him what he likes and dislikes about her affection, and what she can do to make him feel more comfortable and loved. This could help her find a balance between showing her love and respect for his boundaries.

Additionally, the OP could try to find other ways to express her love and affection, such as through small gestures or thoughtful acts, rather than relying solely on physical touch. This could help her feel more connected to her boyfriend without overwhelming him.

Overall, the OP's concern is a common and relatable one, and with open communication and a willingness to compromise, she and her boyfriend can find a way to navigate this issue and maintain a healthy and loving relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by answering my phone

POST: Actually happened yesterday. So theres this girl I've met on the internet and we were already chatting for a couple of months. She was the kinda girl that *really* liked talking on the phone. I told her many times that I usually don't like talking on my phone that much but she kept calling me two to three times a day. So one day she couldn't hear me, no idea why. I tried sending voicemails and other stuff but it seemed like my microphone was broken and i told her that. Later that day I just tried restarting my phone and everything worked again, thing is, I never told her that. I lied to her and said something about a repair that would cost 60€ and I didn't want to spend my money for that. Fast forward a few weeks, She asked me out on a date. I've never seen her as a potential girlfriend but decided to meet her anyways just so see how it goes. So the date was going meh, and when she went to see the toilet I wrote my friend a message that he should call me about an importent appointment I forgot to get myself out of this date a quickly as possible. She came back and two minutes later I recieved the call from my friend. Afte I exchanged some words with my friend, I realized what I just did. The girl looked at me as if I just killed somebody. At this point, I knew there was no going back. I lied to her because I didn't want to spend time talking to her and she knew that now too. She looked pretty angry, ran out of the restaurant and I haven't heard anything from her since. Needlesly to say, I'm not going to see her again.

TL;DR: I lied to a girl about my phone being broken to get out of talking to her and it backfired. I'm not going to see her again.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The author, a man, has been chatting with a woman online and has been avoiding talking to her on the phone because he doesn't enjoy it. When she calls him multiple times a day, he tries to find ways to get out of talking to her, including lying about his phone being broken. However, when she asks him out on a date, he decides to meet her anyway, hoping to get out of the situation quickly. He writes a message to his friend, pretending to have an important appointment, and then takes the call from his friend when the woman goes to the bathroom. The woman discovers his lie and becomes angry, leaving the restaurant and not speaking to him again.

This story is a great example of how lying can lead to negative consequences and how it can be difficult to recover from a mistake. The author is left feeling embarrassed and regretful, and is unlikely to see the woman again. The story also highlights the importance of honesty and communication in relationships, and how lying can damage trust and lead to conflict. Overall, this post is a relatable and entertaining example of a TIFU story.

TITLE: Can loseit help me lose 15 pounds?

POST: I just bought my prom dress online, and to my horror I found that it didn't fit properly. Sadly, the dress went through 3 countries before I got it and so the deadline for sending the dress back is long past. Therefore I'm hell-bent on making the dress fit. I want to lose about 15 pounds before prom in June, and wondered if loseit could help me!

I'm 17, F, 5 7" and about 185 pounds. In other words overweight. I've always been of the muscular type with a somewhat bulky (ಠ_ಠ) upper body, and I want to lose fat, and not so much muscle. I got access to a modest gym with the most basic equipment, and now that it's getting warmer I'm also open to doing stuff outside. What I *don't* have access to, however, is proper food as I live in a host family as a poor student. I therefore can't afford to buy a lot of fancy food.

Does loseit have some healthy tips as to what what options I got with food, healthy snacks and stuff, and what do do in the gym to reach my goals? :)

TL;DR: 17-year-old girl wants to lose 15 pounds for prom, has access to a basic gym and wants to know if loseit can help her with healthy food options and gym workouts.

**Comments:**

1. **u/fitnessgeek**: Hey there! Congrats on taking the first step towards your goal. I'd be happy to help you with some tips. First, let's focus on your diet. As a student, it can be tough to afford healthy food, but there are some affordable options you can try. For example, you can buy canned beans, lentils, and vegetables, and cook them with some rice or quinoa. You can also try making your own granola bars with rolled oats, nuts, and dried fruits. As for snacks, you can try baby carrots with hummus, or air-popped popcorn with a sprinkle of cinnamon.

For your gym workouts, I'd recommend starting with some cardio exercises like jogging, cycling, or swimming. You can also try bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges. Remember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration as you get more comfortable.

Lastly, don't forget to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Good luck on your fitness journey, and I hope you reach your goal in time for prom!

2. **u/healthyliving**: Hi there! I'm glad you're taking the initiative to make a change. As a student, it can be tough to prioritize your health, but it's great that you're making it a priority.

In terms of food, I'd recommend trying to incorporate more whole foods into your diet. You can try making a big batch of brown rice and beans on the weekend, and then portion it out for the week. You can also try making your own salads with mixed greens, veggies, and a simple vinaigrette dressing.

For snacks, you can try keeping a bag of almonds or cashews on hand, or making your own trail mix with rolled oats, nuts, and dried fruits. As for gym workouts, I'd recommend starting with some light cardio exercises like jogging or cycling, and then gradually increasing the intensity and duration as you get more comfortable.

Remember to also prioritize getting enough sleep and taking breaks throughout the day. It's okay to take it one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. You got this!

3. **u/loseit**: Hey there! I'm glad you're excited to start your fitness journey. As a community, we're all about supporting each other and providing helpful tips and advice.

In terms of food, I'd recommend trying to incorporate more protein-rich foods into your diet, such as lean meats, fish, and eggs. You can also try making your own protein shakes with Greek yogurt, spinach, and banana. As for snacks, you can try keeping a bag of baby carrots with hummus on hand, or making your own energy balls with rolled oats, nuts, and dried fruits.

For gym workouts, I'd recommend starting with some light cardio exercises like jogging or cycling, and then gradually increasing the intensity and duration as you get more comfortable. You can also try incorporating some strength training exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges.

Remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, and don't be afraid to reach out if you have any questions or need any advice. Good luck on your fitness journey, and I hope you reach your goal in time for prom!

TITLE: I(15m) want to talk to girl(15f) I have a crush or interest in..but..

POST: Sorry for horrible writing. Not my best work, but I'm tired and I'm about to go to sleep.

I go to a small highschool only for freshman (Also known as a ninth grade center) and There's this girl that caught my eye. I don't know her name because I don't have her for any classes, but we see each other every morning and make eye contact, but never talk. In fact, I don't think I've seen her talk with anybody before. She's bilingual so I'm starting to wonder if bad English is the reason why or if she has no interest in meeting anyone or if she's mute or other reasons. I'm over thinking this, but to explain why I'm over thinking this I should talk about myself a little and continue.

I'm a shy guy.. Like a really shy guy with anxiety and shit i don't want to get into, but I've never really had a lot of friends hardly any my entire life, and always was insecure about myself and didn't want to bother anybody with my presence so yeah I basically am a mess with few friends and I'd like to meet this cute girl and Maybe ask her out if she seems interested.. Though there is a bit of a problem. School is about to end and I can only see her in the mornings for a couple minutes and I feel like I wouldn't have time to introduce myself enough to make her feel comfortable enough to exchange social media to talk outside of school so I don't know what to do or what to say or how to even get the courage to walk up to her, introduce myself and Strike up a conversation without messing up or worse.

Any ideas or tips or like suggestions on what I should say or how to uh basically not fuck up.

P.S highly unlikely but paranoid she's reading this.
P.S.S. throwaway because I'm ashamed that I'm making this because of a simple situation when most things on this thread are serious..

TL;DR: I'm a shy guy with anxiety who has a crush on a girl I see every morning, but I don't know her name and I'm too scared to approach her. I want to know what to say and how to not mess up.

**Top comments:**

* "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in a similar situation a few years ago. What I did was, I started by just smiling at her and saying 'hi' every morning. It was a small step, but it helped me get used to talking to her. Then, I started asking her about her interests and hobbies. It turned out we had a lot in common, and we started talking more and more. Eventually, we exchanged numbers and started texting. It was a slow process, but it worked for me. Just remember to be genuine and respectful, and don't be too pushy. Good luck!"
* "OP, I think you're overthinking this. Just go up to her and introduce yourself. Say something simple like 'Hi, I'm [your name]. I've seen you around and thought I'd say hi.' If she's interested, she'll respond. If not, oh well. At least you tried. And who knows, she might be shy too and just needs someone to break the ice."
* "I'm a girl, and I can tell you that it's okay to be nervous. But don't let your anxiety hold you back. Just be yourself and be respectful. If she's not interested, that's okay. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you. And who knows, you might be surprised by how well you connect with her. Just go for it and see what happens."
* "OP, I think you're focusing too much on the 'what ifs' and not enough on the present moment. Just enjoy the morning conversations you have with her, and see where they take you. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to get a specific outcome. Just be yourself and have fun. And if it doesn't work out, that's okay too. You'll learn and grow from the experience."
* "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that it's okay to be nervous. But don't let your anxiety hold you back. Just be yourself and be respectful. If she's not interested, that's okay. There are plenty of other people out there who might be a better match for you. And who knows, you might be surprised by how well you connect with her. Just go for it and see what happens."

TITLE: My gf (19) never comes in to the liquor store of a guy we know to buy alcohol. Is this legit? (I'm 19) Note: We live in Michigan, drinking age 21 here.

POST: My gf and I go to the liquor store of a guy we know about once a week, and I usually go in to buy beer or whatever we're drinking. It never really bothered me until recently that she always sits in the car. The guy we know is a mutual friend's friend. I asked her about it a couple of months ago, and she said she just didn't want to get in any trouble. 

At the time, this was somewhat legitimate because she was here on an H-4 visa (her dad is here on an H-1 visa and her status is dependent on him). However, about a month ago, she received her green card. I asked her why she couldn't come in with me to pick out our drinks now and she still says the same thing. 

Naturally, I point out that we would be in the same amount of trouble if we got caught, which we wouldn't anyways since we've been buying consistently for well over a year from this guy. I know there's no sense of both of us risking our necks to get alcohol, but it annoys the shit out of me that she seems to think that I should have to go inside to buy our drinks because she doesn't want to get in trouble. 

I don't mind paying for the drinks since I get paid a lot more than her, but I can't help but feel like she thinks she's more important than me or something because she doesn't mind if I risk my neck to go get alcohol, but she absolutely refuses to even come inside with me.

Input? Advice? What should I say or do? Or just suck it up?

TL;DR: My 19-year-old girlfriend never comes into the liquor store with me, even though we've been buying from the same guy for over a year. She says she doesn't want to get in trouble, but I think it's ridiculous that she expects me to risk my neck to get our drinks. What should I do?

---

This post is a great example of a common issue in relationships: differing opinions and expectations. The OP (original poster) is frustrated that his girlfriend is not willing to come into the liquor store with him, despite the fact that they have been buying from the same guy for over a year. The girlfriend's reason for not coming in is that she doesn't want to get in trouble, but the OP thinks this is unfair and that she should be willing to take the same risk as him.

The post highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. The OP should try to have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns. He should explain why he thinks it's unfair that she expects him to take the risk alone and ask her to consider his perspective. He should also listen to her reasons for not wanting to come in and try to understand her concerns.

It's also important to note that the OP's girlfriend may have valid reasons for not wanting to come into the liquor store, such as fear of getting in trouble or feeling uncomfortable in the situation. The OP should try to understand and respect her feelings, even if he doesn't agree with them.

Overall, the post is a great example of how relationships can be complex and challenging, and how important it is to communicate and understand each other's perspectives in order to build a strong and healthy relationship.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my gf [19 F] of 6 months, is it bad of me to reconsider the relationship due to her low sex drive?

POST: Me and my gf met on tinder and have been dating for ~6 months now. The start of the relationship was fun, and best of all was the sex. We both loved it. She was a lot more experienced than I am, she has slept with 8 people where I have only slept with 2 (current gf included) but that was never an issue.

About 2 months into the relationship we both moved cities for university, coincidentally we had both been accepted by the same one and now live just minutes away from eachother, as opposed to the 45 minute drive before hand. But then the relationship changed - she started getting more jealous, we argued a lot and it seemed like we were going to lose eachother but we both stuck through it. 

We had to start searching for a house in the private sector rather than in University accommodation for second and third year study, and I felt like it would be sensible to get separate houses with friends just to be safe, as we are in a new relationship and this was my first'real' relationship, but when I told her she took it as an offence, like I was trying to get away from her. It took me a while to reason with her, and though she still doesn't agree with me, she is accepting of my decision.

We've been going steady for a month or two now without arguing but the relationship is different, there's no spark. We seem to just sit and watch tv, and the sex is down to about once or twice a fortnight. I know that can be classed as the honeymoon stage passing but the sex just feels forced. Like we only do it because we haven't in a while. I have tried a few times to mention that I would like to have more sex but she doesn't seem as enthusiastic. Am I a bad person for saying this? We are happy together but this has been bugging me for a while.

TL;DR: Me and my 19 year old girlfriend have been dating for 6 months, we've had some issues but we've worked through them. The sex has slowed down to once or twice a fortnight and I feel like it's forced. I've tried to mention it to her but she doesn't seem as enthusiastic. Am I a bad person for considering reevaluating the relationship due to this?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not a bad person for feeling this way. It's normal to want a healthy sex life in a relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "It's not just about the sex, it's about the intimacy and connection you're missing. You need to talk to your girlfriend about how you're feeling and see if you can find a way to rekindle that spark. It's not about being a bad person, it's about being honest with yourself and your partner."
* "I think you're being a bit unfair. You're expecting your girlfriend to have the same sex drive as you, which is unrealistic. Everyone's different and it's not always easy to maintain a certain level of intimacy. Maybe you should try to focus on other aspects of your relationship that you enjoy, like the conversations and shared activities."
* "You're not a bad person for feeling this way, but you might be a bad partner if you're only staying in the relationship because of the sex. You need to think about what you're getting out of the relationship and what you're putting in. If it's just about the sex, then maybe you're not ready for a committed relationship."
* "I think you should try to communicate with your girlfriend about how you're feeling, but also be open to the possibility that she might not be interested in having sex as often as you are. It's not always about the other person, sometimes it's just about personal preferences. You need to find a way to be happy with each other, even if that means adjusting your expectations."

TITLE: What to do about SO's terrible family?

POST: SO (21M) and I (20F) have been together 5 years and talk about marriage somewhat often. We love each other very much and are always happy thinking of our futures together. However, every time I think about our future especially the idea of a wedding, I get worried due to his family. They are emotionally (and on occasion physically) abusive people who take their hatred of each other out on their "unwanted" son. They have caused horrible psychological scarring in my SO and I hate being around them. They've never been very kind/receptive to me and I get terrible anxiety whenever I have to be around them. They are your purest form of white trash. SO knows how awful they are and has frankly said that maybe we should just never tell them if/when we get married. Just wondering if anyone out there has had to deal with a similar situation and how to handle the possibility of a wedding without one of the families involved?

TL;DR: SO's family is emotionally and physically abusive, causing psychological scarring. I get anxious around them. We're considering marriage, but SO doesn't want to tell them. How do I handle this?

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not your problem to fix, but it's definitely not okay for your SO to put you in a situation where you have to deal with their toxic family. Have an open and honest conversation with your SO about how you feel. You deserve better than to be put in a situation that makes you anxious and uncomfortable."
* "I've been in a similar situation with my ex's family. It's exhausting and draining. You need to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries. If that means not involving them in your wedding, so be it. You don't owe them anything."
* "I think it's great that your SO is willing to consider not telling them about the wedding. That shows he cares about your feelings and is willing to prioritize your comfort. You should have a conversation with him about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being."
* "I'm a bit surprised that your SO hasn't already cut ties with his family. Emotional and physical abuse is not something to be taken lightly. You need to have a serious conversation with him about why he's still involved with them and what he plans to do to protect himself and your relationship."
* "I think you should consider having a small, intimate wedding with just close friends and family. That way, you can still celebrate your love and commitment to each other without having to deal with the toxic family. It's not about excluding them, it's about prioritizing your own happiness and well-being."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is struggling with the idea of involving her SO's toxic family in their wedding plans.
* The comments suggest that the OP should prioritize her own well-being and set boundaries.
* The OP should have an open and honest conversation with her SO about her feelings and concerns.
* It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize one's own well-being, even if it means not involving toxic family members in wedding plans.
* The OP should consider having a small, intimate wedding with just close friends and family to avoid dealing with the toxic family.

TITLE: Reddit. What is your scariest vacation story?

POST: Personally, I recently visited the Bahamas. We did an all-day scooter rental and covered the whole Nassau island...that is until my scooter broke down. I was at one of the private beaches, and asked a bus driver if I could use his phone to call the rental place. He looked me dead in the eye and said "No, but let me tell you something. If you know what's good for you, you'll leave this beach immediately." everyone in the beach was looking at me with wide eyes. Needless to say I rigged a towing system from my buddy's scooter and got the hell out of there.

TL;DR: My scooter broke down in the Bahamas, and a bus driver told me to leave the beach immediately. Everyone was staring at me with wide eyes. I had to rig a towing system to get out of there.

* "I've had some weird experiences while traveling, but this takes the cake. Did you report the incident to the rental place or the authorities?"
* "I've heard of people having weird encounters while traveling, but this is on a whole other level. Did you feel like you were in danger?"
* "I'm glad you got out of there, but I'm also curious - what was the bus driver's demeanor like? Was he aggressive or just weirdly calm?"
* "I've had some bad experiences with rental places, but this takes the cake. Did you get a refund or compensation for the broken scooter?"
* "I'm glad you're okay, but this is definitely a story to tell. Did you take any photos or videos of the beach or the bus driver?"

TITLE: I(24) really appreciate my gf(22), but I don't know if I'm wasting her time.

POST: We've been (me M/24, her F/22) together for almost a year now and I've been very happy and excited in the beginning. I appreciate her, because she likes the whole me with every flaw I have. It's worth to note that I'm her first boyfriend.

The problem is that I really don't think that I love her as much as I did before and she certainly loves me way more as I far as I can see it.

I think I might be wasting her time, because I'm constantly thinking of being with other women, but I would never act on it, these are just thought, but they're there nonetheless. I really think this is unfair to her on my part. 

I had only 2 relationships in my life counting this one too, so I'm not experienced one bit. A few people with whom I discussed my problems said that these are not good signs. **What's your opinion?** Would you break up so you don't waste her time or try to work it out somehow?

*Thank you for reading!

TL;DR: I'm 24, been with my 22-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. I don't think I love her as much as I used to, and I have thoughts about being with other women. I'm worried I'm wasting her time. Should I break up or try to work it out?*

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're not ready for a committed relationship. You're still exploring your feelings and desires, and that's okay. It's not fair to lead someone on when you're not sure about your own feelings. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your doubts and concerns. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to string her along."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and concerns. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not feeling the same way as we used to. I would recommend taking some time to reflect on what you want and need in a relationship. Are you looking for something more casual or do you want to work on building a deeper connection with your girlfriend? Once you have a better understanding of your own desires, you can have a more informed conversation with your girlfriend about your future together."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're being unfair to your girlfriend by having these thoughts and not acting on them. If you're not happy in the relationship, it's okay to acknowledge that and have a conversation with your girlfriend about it. But it's not fair to have these thoughts and not do anything about them. You're essentially leading her on and wasting her time. I would suggest being honest with yourself and your girlfriend about your feelings and desires. If you're not happy, it's okay to end the relationship and move on."
4. **ConcernedCousin**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you truly unhappy in the relationship, or are you just going through a phase? Have you talked to your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns? Sometimes, relationships can go through ups and downs, and it's normal to feel uncertain or unfulfilled at times. But if you're consistently feeling this way, it might be worth having a conversation with your girlfriend about your future together. Remember, relationships are about growth and communication. If you're not willing to work through your issues and communicate openly with your partner, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship."
5. **RealisticRomantic**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. Everyone has thoughts and desires that they don't act on. It's normal to have fantasies or daydreams about other people, but it doesn't mean you're not committed to your girlfriend. If you're happy in the relationship and you're not actively pursuing other relationships, then I think you're being unfair to yourself and your girlfriend. It's okay to have desires and fantasies, but it's not okay to act on them without being honest with your partner. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and desires. It's better to be upfront and respectful than to hide your true feelings and risk hurting someone you care about."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

TITLE: Need Help Understanding Relationship M[21] with F[21]

POST: Relationship time: 5 months

Hey /relationships,

So I met this girl at OSU earlier this year, and we both fell deeply in love.  This was my first real relationship, and I was smitten completely - I fell hard for her, and she did the same for me.  Now, at around 7 days, she said I love you, and I returned it, for I really thought that I felt that way.  Around 2 months in, we were talking about marriage and getting engaged, and formulating plans together for the future.  

Now here is the issue.  I no longer am sure about getting engaged or married.  I definitely still want to be with her, but I am finally coming to my senses and realizing that 6 months is way, way, Way too soon to get engaged, and that I want to know her for a few years before I am comfortable with being married.  We're just beginning to get to know each other and commit to each other for life right now would just be laying the grounds for a potentially unhappy and unsuccessful marriage.

With all of that being said, I know the general consensus will just be to talk about it, and keep both parties on the same page regarding the relationship, and this is what I would do, if I knew that she wouldn't freak out completely.  She has deep abandonment issues and trust issues which we have been working through together, and I know she would view this as a violation of her trust and love.  I've always assumed honesty is the best policy, but I'm just not sure about what to do in this circumstance.

TL;DR: I'm 21, been in a relationship for 5 months, and I'm having doubts about getting engaged/married.  I still want to be with her, but I need time to get to know her better before committing to a lifelong partnership.  I'm worried about how she'll react to this revelation, given her trust and abandonment issues.

What do you guys think?  Should I just be honest with her, or is there a better way to approach this situation?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's better to have this conversation now rather than later. It's better to be honest and upfront about your feelings and concerns than to lead her on and potentially hurt her more in the long run. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about our future together and I'm not feeling ready to get engaged/married yet. I still really care about you and value our relationship, but I need some more time to figure some things out.' Be prepared for her to be upset, but try to have the conversation in a calm and respectful manner."
* "I think you should have the conversation with her, but also be prepared to listen to her feelings and concerns. It's possible that she may have been thinking about getting engaged/married too, and this could be a shock to her. Try to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and concerns, and see where it takes you."
* "I think you should be honest with her, but also be prepared for the possibility that she may not be ready to hear it. If she's been thinking about getting engaged/married, she may be feeling a sense of urgency and may not be willing to listen to your concerns. Try to have the conversation in a calm and respectful manner, and be prepared to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you."
* "I think you should take some time to think about your feelings and concerns before having the conversation with her. It's possible that you may not be ready to get engaged/married yet, and that's okay. Take some time to figure out what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship, and then have the conversation with her. Be honest and upfront about your feelings and concerns, and see where it takes you."

TITLE: Going on a date in an hour.. Super nervous need help

POST: I got out of a bad relationship two months ago that lasted almost a year. I haven't been on a first date for over a year.. I met this girl on Tinder and made it clear I wasn't looking to just hook up. We've been talking and share a lot in common, down to the fact we both smoke pot and love cartoons from the 90's. I've been pretty smooth on the phone but in real life I'm very shy. I think I've gotten a little less shy since I got out of my last relationship, but I really wanna wow this girl. We're going to see the new Fast and Furious movie.  We're both passive people, as I'm very shy and nice and she seems to be just like me in that she doesn't like to be the one making decisions. I don't like making decisions either, but I made the decision of when and what movie to see. What should I do?

TL;DR: Going on a first date in an hour, super nervous. Haven't been on a first date in a year, haven't been on a date in real life in a long time. Want to make a good impression, but I'm shy and don't like making decisions. What should I do?

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're gonna be fine! Just be yourself, relax, and have fun. Remember, it's okay to be a little nervous, it's normal. Try to focus on getting to know her and having a good time, rather than trying to 'wow' her. And hey, if it doesn't work out, there's always Tinder to try again"
* "I'm a girl and I can relate to being shy and not liking to make decisions. Just be honest with her about your feelings and see if she's okay with it. Maybe you can even make a game out of it and take turns making decisions. And don't worry too much about making a good impression, just be yourself and see if you have a connection"
* "I'm a guy and I've been in your shoes before. Just remember that it's okay to be a little awkward, it's a first date! Try to find some common ground to talk about, like the movie you're seeing. And don't worry too much about making decisions, just go with the flow. And hey, if it doesn't work out, there's always the next date"
* "I think it's great that you're taking things slow and not trying to rush into anything. Just enjoy the date and see where it takes you. And hey, if you do happen to make a decision, just be honest with her and explain that you're not comfortable making decisions. She might appreciate your honesty"

TITLE: My (28/f) girlfriend opened up to me about her past and now I (31/m) feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go and stop judging her. Any advice is appreciated.

POST: An amazing woman entered my life a few months ago. We hit it off right away and have been discovering new facets to our chemistry ever since. It's been mind-blowingly great in just about every way. She is absolutely crazy about me, and I felt the same about her until she recently opened up to me about her past. She told me that she's been with tons of guys, saying that it was often an 'obligation' for having been taken out on a couple dates, that she could easily separate the emotional and physical aspects of sex.

I really feel that I've lost a great deal of respect for her, and I don't fully understand why. I've always associated such feelings with jealousy, insecurity, or mistrust, but this doesn't feel like that to me. It just feels like I think less of her. I want so badly to let it go. She's absolutely incredible in so many ways that are important to me. 

My brain tells me that feeling this way is immature, stupid, and extremely unfair to her. I have a past too. I have no right to expect anything of her before we met. But her past is of the type that I have specifically avoided in my own life, generally feeling that it was a matter of self-respect. I've always thought it was important to reserve sex for meaningful relationships. 

Am I being overly judgmental? Is any part of what I'm feeling rational?

How do I forgive her past? Maybe forgive isn't the right word, because I don't necessarily think she's done anything wrong. But how do I let it go?

TL;DR: My girlfriend opened up about her past, and I feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go and stop judging her, but I'm struggling. Any advice is appreciated.

TITLE: How do I get over my feelings of disapproval and judgment towards my girlfriend's past?

POST: Hi, I'm a 31-year-old man, and I've been dating an amazing woman for a few months. We've been having an incredible time together, and I thought I was happy with her. However, recently she opened up to me about her past, and it's been hard for me to shake off the feelings of disapproval and judgment. 

She told me that she's been with a lot of guys, and that she's not really sure why she did it. She said it was often an 'obligation' for having been taken out on a couple dates, and that she could easily separate the emotional and physical aspects of sex. I feel like I've lost respect for her, and I'm not sure how to get over these feelings.

I know that I'm being unfair, and that everyone has their own past. But I've always associated such behavior with a lack of self-respect, and I've never done anything like that myself. I want to be a good partner and support her, but I'm struggling to let go of these feelings.

How do I get over my feelings of disapproval and judgment? Is there anything I can do to work through this and move forward?

TL;DR: My girlfriend opened up about her past, and I feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to be a good partner and support her, but I'm struggling to let go of these feelings. How do I get over my disapproval and judgment?

The two posts are similar, but the tone and language used are slightly different. The first post is more introspective and self-critical, with the author acknowledging that their feelings are likely irrational and unfair. The second post is more direct and straightforward, with the author asking for advice on how to overcome their feelings of disapproval and judgment.

Both posts demonstrate a desire to understand and overcome their negative emotions, and to move forward in a positive and supportive way. They also show a willingness to listen to and consider the perspectives of others, which is an important aspect of building and maintaining healthy relationships.

In terms of the advice that might be given in response to these posts, it could include suggestions such as:

* Practicing empathy and understanding, and trying to see things from your girlfriend's perspective
* Recognizing that everyone has their own past and experiences, and that it's not fair to judge or criticize your girlfriend for hers
* Focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that you love and appreciate about your girlfriend
* Having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns, and working together to find a way forward
* Seeking support and guidance from a therapist or counselor, if needed.

Overall, the key to overcoming feelings of disapproval and judgment is to approach the situation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to listen and learn. By doing so, you can work towards building a stronger and more positive relationship with your girlfriend.

TITLE: Me [25] with my "exclusive" FWB/GF [27 F] three months... ignoring me while she's out of town for spring break.

POST: Everything was fantastic before she left, like I literally had one of the best times of my life with her early this week. 

The night before she left I asked her if were exclusive, and she asked if I was worried she was going to cheat on the trip. I played it as calm as possible "a girl is going to do what she's going to do,  I can't stop you either way... but I like you and.. blah blah blah..." Although it wasn't fully aired out, the cuddling/kissing combined with "just trust me baby I'm not gonna hurt you..." talk made me feel like we were. 

IDK, I thought we were cool We had sex since I asked her that...  then she went out of town and I haven't heard from her since day one. 

Like she sent me a trivial  text, I responded 5 minutes later, then didn't get anything else for over 24 hours, when I texted her again... a "what'sup, having fun".

No response, going on three days now since I last heard from her Tuesday morning.

I don't text her again right? It would be too clingy? Is it time to start assuming the worse?  

Would a "are you okay...?" kind of text leaning on I'm worried for her safety be a good thing to try?

TL;DR: My "exclusive" FWB/GF ignored me after I asked her if we were exclusive, and I'm unsure what to do.

---

**Community Response:**

* Many users agree that it's reasonable to feel concerned and unsure about the situation. Some suggest that it's okay to send a follow-up text to check in, but not to overdo it.
* A few users recommend taking a step back and giving her space, as she may be busy or dealing with personal issues.
* Some users advise against sending a "are you okay...?" text, as it may come across as insincere or clingy.
* A few users suggest that it's time to assume the worst and move on, as the lack of communication is concerning.
* One user suggests that the OP should have a conversation with her about the lack of communication and how it's making him feel.

**OP's Follow-up:**

* The OP thanks the community for their input and decides to send a follow-up text asking if everything is okay.
* The OP receives a response from her saying that she's been busy and didn't mean to ignore him, but she's still having fun and will talk to him when she gets back.
* The OP is left feeling uncertain and unsure about the future of their relationship.

**Conclusion:**

The community's response highlights the importance of communication in relationships and the need for clarity and honesty. The OP's situation is a classic example of the challenges that can arise when there is a lack of communication and boundaries are not clearly defined. The community's advice to take a step back and give her space, while also being honest about one's feelings, is a good starting point for the OP to navigate this situation. Ultimately, the OP's decision to send a follow-up text and have a conversation with her about the lack of communication is a good step towards resolving the issue and moving forward.

TITLE: [PA] Serving an "underager" as a Bartender

POST: I'm a bartender at a restaurant/bar which can get pretty busy on friday night.  So, we have a bouncer who cards everyone at the door.  As he is the one in charge of this process, I'm assuming, probably incorrectly, that he assumes liability for anyone allowed in underage. This carding includes looking at the IDs as well as swiping.  PA IDs, or so I'm told, are generally difficult to fake so if he gives them the okay, I don't usually double check.  

Apparently, two girls came in one Friday night and the one was underage.  We only discovered this because the girl's father came in and was complaining that she got served because she's only 20.  Assuming he reports this, what kind of legal trouble could I be looking at?

TL;DR: Bartender in PA, served an underage girl (20) without double checking ID, what kind of legal trouble could I face?

---

**Legal Advice**

**TL;DR:** As a bartender in PA, serving an underage girl (20) without double checking ID could lead to legal trouble, including fines and potential criminal charges.

**Full Response:**

As a bartender in PA, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are not serving minors. While the bouncer may have initially cleared the girls, it is your duty to verify their age before serving them. Serving an underage individual, even if they are 20, is illegal in PA.

If the father reports this incident, you could face legal consequences, including:

1. **Fines:** The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) can impose fines on you and your establishment for serving an underage individual.
2. **Criminal Charges:** You could face criminal charges, such as furnishing alcohol to a minor, which is a misdemeanor offense in PA.
3. **Loss of Liquor License:** If you are found guilty of serving an underage individual, the PLCB can revoke your liquor license.

To avoid legal trouble, it is essential to:

1. **Verify IDs:** Always verify the age and identity of customers before serving them.
2. **Train Staff:** Ensure that all staff members, including bouncers and bartenders, understand the importance of verifying IDs and the consequences of serving minors.
3. **Follow Procedures:** Establish and follow procedures for verifying IDs, and ensure that all staff members are aware of these procedures.

Remember, as a bartender, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are not serving minors. Always prioritize responsible service and follow the laws and regulations in your state. If you have any questions or concerns, consult with a legal professional or the PLCB.

TITLE: Single again and lonely :/

POST: I realized today that I (21 f) seriously have an issue with dependency. My ex bf (26 m) broke up with me about 2 weeks ago. It was a LDR and kind of feels like we broke up for no reason. I went to visit regularly but I suppose it wasn't enough for him. It hurts even more because we haven't kept in contact even though we're "Friends." We were only together for about 9 months if you count the period of time we started talking. Right before getting into that relationship, I was with another guy (22 m) for about 3 years. We also don't keep in contact.  And before that, I was kind of with a guy (23 m) that was in jail for about a year. Basically, I haven't been completely single in 4+ years. How do I get my mind off my exs and guys in general? I don't really want a relationship anytime soon. Was considering a fwb but I feel like I deserve more than just being someone's fuckbuddy. I don't really have friends so I feel stuck. What should I do?

TL;DR: Single again after 4+ years of being in a relationship. Feeling lonely and stuck. Need advice on how to get over my exs and not feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

RESPONSES:

1. **OP, you're not alone!** I went through a similar situation a few years ago. It took me a while to realize that I was stuck in a pattern of dependency and that I needed to focus on myself. I started taking classes, joined a gym, and started volunteering. It helped me to meet new people and find new hobbies. I also started journaling and meditating to help me clear my mind. It's not easy, but it's worth it. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, not just stuck in a rut.

2. **Take time for yourself!** You're right, you do deserve more than just being someone's fuckbuddy. Take time to focus on yourself, your goals, and your desires. What are you passionate about? What do you want to achieve in your life? Start working on those things and you'll find that you'll be less focused on your exs and more focused on your own happiness.

3. **Don't be too hard on yourself!** It's okay to feel lonely and stuck. It's a normal part of life. Don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, focus on the things that you can control and take small steps towards changing your situation. You got this!

4. **Try online communities!** There are many online communities and forums dedicated to people who are going through similar situations. You might find it helpful to connect with others who are also struggling with dependency and loneliness. You can also try online courses or therapy to help you work through your feelings.

5. **Practice self-care!** Take care of your physical and emotional health. Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise regularly, and do things that bring you joy. You can also try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation to help you manage stress and anxiety.

6. **Give yourself time!** It's not going to happen overnight, but with time and effort, you can work through your feelings and move on. Be patient with yourself and don't put too much pressure on yourself to "get over" your exs. Just focus on taking small steps towards a happier, healthier you.

7. **Try to focus on the present!** Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, try to focus on the present moment. What are you grateful for? What are you looking forward to? What can you control in your life right now? Focusing on the present can help you feel more grounded and less stuck.

8. **Don't be afraid to reach out!** If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, don't be afraid to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can help you work through your feelings and provide you with the tools and resources you need to move forward. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone!

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my (friends with benefits?) [18 F] confused.

POST: So let me start off by saying I've been "seeing" this girl for about two weeks. She's sweet, a total tomboy, and she's real cool. Now normally I fall head over heels for girls, but after our first date she made it clear she wasn't necessarily looking to date. Fine by me, I'm in a phase of my life where I'm fine without a girlfriend, but the problem is I'm a virgin and plan to stay so (until I find someone I love enough to give it away). That makes hookups difficult. This girl has slept over on weekends, and I've gone out drinking with her friends, it's a good time, but I'm realizing now that I kind of want a relationship. It doesn't have to be with her, but I care about her, and she had one of those drunk spill all moments the other night. She basically said that she cares about me way too much and wants a relationship but is scared and so she'll never date me. She said however she would date me if we eventually had sex. This scared the crap out of me. If you like me, date me because you like me, not because you want my sex. It's so confusing.

On top of this, there are two girls who I know for a fact would love for me to ask them out. I could do this as I don't have any immediate attachments to the girl I'm fwb'ing with (if you can call it that), and they're both definitely looking for a relationship. It's strange because I usually fall head over heels for the girls I'm seeing very quickly, but this time it's been different. I'm just really confused. I think I'm going through a phase or something. Thanks guys. Appreciate help in advance.

-Kirby1056

TL;DR: 20-year-old guy has been friends with benefits with an 18-year-old girl for two weeks. He's starting to develop feelings for her, but she's made it clear she only wants a relationship if they have sex. He's unsure if he wants to pursue a relationship with her or ask out other girls who are interested in him. He's confused about his feelings and wants advice.

TITLE: Interested in my ex's good friend

POST: I dated a girl who we'll call Jane for 8 months and was very in love with her. To make a long story short, over the summer we broke up and I was devastated but, as is part of life, I had to move on. So I started talking to other people and the one person in specific I started talking to was her friend - let's call her Nicole. So Nicole and I got to talking a lot and rather quickly I became really interested in her. So one day, I invited her over to my house thinking that we would just hang out as friends because that's all I really thought of it but things started getting pretty flirty. I brought attention to a vodka bottle I had in the cabinet twice not for the purpose of convincing her to drink some with me but just pointing it out. The second time she suggest we have some so we did. We both got a bit tipsy and nearly kissed but instead both decided that on account of Jane that would not be a good idea for either of us because I admittedly still had feelings for Jane. Despite this decision, I continued flirting with Nicole and she continued flirting with me. We started hanging out a lot and cuddling and doing essentially anything but actually kissing. Again, to make a long story short, over the past few months we've hung out a lot and flirted a lot and cuddled but we keep getting stopped by something. Despite knowing that this thing is Jane I decided to ask Nicole today. So we went for a walk and talked and she said that if it were not for Jane she would definitely be interested in me but that she can't do that to Jane. I want to have something more than a friendship with Nicole but because of my relationship with Jane which, to restate, she ended Nicole doesn't see that happening. I basically want to know if there is anything I could do to convince Nicole otherwise.

TL;DR: I dated Jane for 8 months, broke up, started talking to her friend Nicole, got interested in her, but she's hesitant because of Jane. I want to know if there's anything I can do to convince her otherwise.

---

**ADVICE FROM THE REDDIT COMMUNITY**

* **Don't try to convince her otherwise**: "Honestly, it's not your place to try to convince Nicole to pursue something with you. Respect her decision and her friendship with Jane. If she's not willing to risk her friendship for you, then it's not meant to be." (u/throwaway1234567)
* **Focus on yourself**: "Instead of trying to convince Nicole, focus on yourself and your own personal growth. Work on healing from your past relationship and figuring out what you want in a partner. When you're ready, you'll attract someone who is right for you." (u/smartypants123)
* **Respect Jane's feelings**: "Remember that Jane is still a person with feelings, and it's not okay to pursue someone who is still friends with her. Respect her boundaries and don't try to hurt her by pursuing her friend." (u/just_a_random_user)
* **Communicate openly**: "Have an open and honest conversation with Nicole about your feelings and boundaries. Let her know that you understand her hesitation and respect her decision. If she's not interested, then it's okay to move on and focus on other relationships." (u/communication_is_key)
* **Don't play games**: "Don't try to play games or manipulate Nicole into pursuing something with you. That's not a healthy or respectful way to approach relationships. Be genuine and respectful, and if it's meant to be, it will happen naturally." (u/no_games_allowed)

TITLE: my SO [f/21] was talking to another guy and lied to me. what is a fair response/continued actions?

POST: My SO and I live together. together for about a year. SO has had a friend who she claimed to be nothing more than a friend. I have meet him and he seemed like a nice enough guy. For a time she talked to him all the time to the point of neglecting me. I confronted her about how I feel and the problem seemed to be done. but i never fully trusted their interactions. A few days ago he sent her a text and I read it. Leading me to read the rest only to find that they have been sexting back and forth with a lot of detail. I don't know how long this has been going on. The only redeeming fact was that they never talked about cheating. My SO and I had just had a great week where we had found a whole new level of trust(Opening up about our sexuality etc.) So naturally I feel hurt and betrayed etc. In trying to show that I could still trust her I told her that they could still talk as friend. We are working on it and I forgave her. She is doing a much better job than I expected trying to show me how much she loves me and that it was just stupid text that went to far. But i can't stop wondering what they are talking about? Am I in the wrong to ask to see their text's back and forth? I don't know if i'm Overeating to this whole thing and obsessing or I'm right to be so paranoid about them. thanks reddit.

TL;DR: SO was talking to another guy, lied about it, and was sexting with him. I forgave her, but I'm still hurt and wondering what they're talking about. Should I ask to see their texts?

**Top comments:**

1. "You're not overreacting at all. You have every right to be upset and concerned. Forgiving her doesn't mean you have to forget what happened or trust her blindly. It's okay to have boundaries and ask questions. You should definitely ask to see their texts and have an open conversation about what happened."
2. "I would ask to see the texts, but also have a conversation with your SO about why she felt the need to lie and what she's doing to prevent it from happening again. It's not just about the sexting, it's about the lack of trust and honesty."
3. "I think you're being too trusting. You forgave her, but you're still wondering what they're talking about? That's not healthy. You need to have a clear understanding of what's going on and what's expected of your SO in terms of communication and honesty."
4. "I would suggest having a conversation with your SO about what you're feeling and what you need from her in terms of trust and communication. It's not about being paranoid, it's about being honest and open about your feelings and needs."
5. "You're not overreacting at all. You have every right to be upset and concerned. Forgiving her doesn't mean you have to forget what happened or trust her blindly. It's okay to have boundaries and ask questions. You should definitely ask to see their texts and have an open conversation about what happened."

**Key takeaways:**

* The OP is justified in feeling hurt and betrayed by their SO's actions.
* Forgiving someone doesn't mean forgetting what happened or trusting them blindly.
* It's okay to have boundaries and ask questions to ensure trust and honesty in the relationship.
* Having an open conversation with your SO about what happened and what's expected of them in terms of communication and honesty is important.
* It's not healthy to be overly trusting or to ignore your feelings and concerns. It's important to address them and work through them together.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my girlfriend [26 F] of 3.5 years has been supporting me financially and emotionally since losing my job a few months ago. How can I show her how much I appreciate her?

POST: Today was a tough day in particular, after waiting three months on what I thought was a very positive interview, I realized I did not get an offer to my top choice of jobs. I have been applying to many jobs, as many as I can, with a few bites but nothing especially promising. We didn't know me being unemployed would last this long, which has been taxing on both of us.

My girlfriend has been here for me: financially, emotionally, and everything in between. I know it must get frustrating for her, especially after so many negatives on my job front. I clean around the apartment, go grocery shopping, do laundry, and do my best to make sure she comes home after work and is able to relax. 

How can I show her how much I care about her, and how much I appreciate everything that she's done and is doing for me? I want her to know, especially after being dealt this particularly huge blow. Lord knows she deserves to feel special.

TL;DR: I'm 26, been unemployed for 3 months, and my girlfriend has been supporting me financially and emotionally. I want to show her how much I appreciate her, but I'm not sure how.

Maybe consider planning a surprise date night or weekend getaway to give her a break and some quality time together. You could also write her a heartfelt letter or make a video message expressing your gratitude. Whatever you choose, I'm sure she'll appreciate the thought and effort you put into it."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, it's amazing that you're recognizing your girlfriend's efforts and wanting to show your appreciation. I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you know it's not easy for her to support you, and that you're grateful for everything she's doing. You could also ask her what she needs from you in terms of support and how you can better help her during this time."
3. **u/sarcastic_sally**: "OP, I think you're being a bit dramatic. Your girlfriend is supporting you, and you're showing your appreciation by doing chores? That's not even a drop in the bucket compared to what she's doing for you. Maybe try to do something more substantial, like paying off some of her expenses or helping her with her own goals and aspirations. That would show her that you're committed to being a team and supporting each other, not just taking advantage of her kindness."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're on the right track by recognizing your girlfriend's efforts and wanting to show your appreciation. However, I would caution against making grand gestures or trying to 'fix' the situation with a single action. Instead, focus on building a stronger connection with your girlfriend by having open and honest conversations, showing your appreciation in small but meaningful ways, and being present and supportive during this challenging time. Remember that relationships are about teamwork and mutual support, not just one person doing all the heavy lifting."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I really appreciate the advice and suggestions. I think I'll take a combination of approaches, including having an open and honest conversation with my girlfriend, planning a surprise date night, and showing my appreciation in small but meaningful ways. I also like the idea of paying off some of her expenses or helping her with her own goals and aspirations. I'll make sure to keep in mind that relationships are about teamwork and mutual support, not just one person doing all the heavy lifting. Thanks again for your help and support!"

TITLE: [25/F] getting married, bridesmaid [25/F] won't get back to me!

POST: Hello,

So I [25/F] am getting married in about 2 months. I had planned to have 3 bridesmaids and a maid of honor. However, one of my bridesmaids [25/F] has been really out of the loop (not answering calls/texts/emails/fb messages). This was also the case when I was trying to ask her to be a bridesmaid (a process which took months to get in touch with her!). My fiancé and I recently moved to another state, so most of our people from our wedding party are from out of town (which I understand limits what they can do to help); however, all my bridal party have gotten matching dresses (of different shades of blue) and she still hasn't even responded to any of their messages either. She always comes up with lame excuses (her phone broke/ she got a new computer- which SHE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO CHECK FB MESSAGES AND EMAILS!). 

She has been a very close friend since we were young (since 11 years old!). I love her to death and we have always had the kind of relationship were we don't need to talk or hang out every weekend to be able to maintain our friendship (we have always been there for any crisis and told each other everything even after months of not talking). I feel like she is really dropping the ball on this tough… It's not like I'm asking her to help with ANY PREPARATIONS for the wedding, just get ANY dress that is blue... I would even help financially but she doesn't respond to ANYTHING.

I have thought about asking her to step down because I find it really rude of her BUT HOW if I can't even get in touch with her?! I am also scared about messing up the friendship… but… I think she already has.

TL;DR: Bridesmaid won't respond to any messages, including dress requests. We've been close friends since childhood, but I feel like she's dropping the ball on this. Should I ask her to step down or try to reach out again?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Honestly, it sounds like she's not interested in being a part of your wedding or your life right now. You've given her plenty of chances to respond and she's blown it off. I would suggest having a calm conversation with her about how her lack of response is affecting you and your wedding plans. If she still doesn't care, it might be time to re-evaluate the friendship.
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: I think you're being way too understanding. If someone can't even be bothered to respond to your messages, they're not worth having in your life. Cut ties with her and move on. You deserve better.
3. **u/bridesmaidproblems**: Girl, I feel you! I had a similar situation with one of my bridesmaids and it was so frustrating. In the end, I just had to accept that she wasn't going to be involved and move on. You can't force someone to care about your wedding or your friendship. Just focus on the people who are actually supporting you.
4. **u/communicationiskey**: I think you're being too quick to judge. Maybe she's going through a tough time and just can't respond right now. Have you tried calling her or sending a message to her partner/family member to see if they know what's going on? Sometimes people just need a little extra understanding and support.
5. **u/weddingplanner**: Honey, you need to take control of this situation! You're the bride, and you deserve to have a stress-free wedding. If this bridesmaid can't even be bothered to respond, then it's time to take her off the list. You can always find someone else to fill the spot. Don't let her drama ruin your special day.

**TL;DR:** The OP is having trouble getting in touch with one of her bridesmaids, who has been unresponsive to messages and requests. The comments are divided on whether the OP should try to reach out again or cut ties with the bridesmaid. Some commenters suggest that the bridesmaid may be going through a tough time, while others think she's just not interested in being involved. The OP is torn between being understanding and wanting to move on from the situation. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that she's feeling frustrated and unsure of what to do.

TITLE: My girlfriend is turning 21 and wants me (21M) to throw her a party. How do I break the news that no one will show up?

POST: Birthdays have always been hard on my girlfriend.  She's had a few parties as a child where no one showed up, and since moving states in the middle of high school she hasn't made close friends.

Here at college, she tries hard to make friends. She talks well to people on a superficial basis but doesn't have any real friends.  She's never been invited to a college party and has often missed out on many typical activities.

We've been together for 3 years, since freshman orientation.  I don't have friends but I'm happy that way.  I like keeping to myself if I'm not spending time with her.  Since she's naturally extroverted, she spends her free time with me, or at club meetings trying to connect to people.  

She's asked if I could put together a small party so I invited some acquaintances, my roommates, etc.  everyone said no.  I gave the invites well in advance too.  I don't know how to break the news to my girlfriend, she's been so excited.  She thought providing free food and drink would be a great way to make friends.  But people don't want to come for even that.  What can I do?

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants me to throw her a 21st birthday party, but I invited acquaintances and they all said no. How do I break the news to her?

COMMENT 1:
Dude, I feel for you. It's tough to break the news to someone who's been looking forward to something. But honestly, it's better to be honest with her now rather than letting her find out later. You could say something like, "Hey, I know you were really looking forward to this party, but unfortunately, none of the people I invited were able to come. I know it's not what you wanted, but I want to make it up to you in some other way. Maybe we can plan a special dinner or activity just the two of us?"

COMMENT 2:
I think you should be honest with her, but also try to spin it in a positive light. You could say something like, "Hey, I know you were really excited about the party, but I think it's actually a good thing that we're not relying on other people to make our social lives. We can focus on spending quality time together and building our own relationship. Plus, we can use the money we would've spent on the party to do something special just for the two of us."

COMMENT 3:
I think you should just be honest with her and apologize for not being able to make it happen. You could say something like, "Hey, I'm really sorry, but none of the people I invited were able to come to the party. I know you were really looking forward to it, and I feel bad that I couldn't make it happen. But I want you to know that I'm here for you and I care about you, and we can still have a great time together even if it's just the two of us."

COMMENT 4:
I think you should try to make it up to her in some way. You could say something like, "Hey, I know the party didn't work out, but I want to make it up to you. How about we plan a special weekend getaway or a fun activity just the two of us? I know it's not the same as the party, but I want to make sure you feel special and celebrated on your birthday."

TITLE: My [18F] "girlfriend" is acting pretty weird with me [18M] lately

POST: Hey Reddit! Over the past week or so my SO of 6 months has been acting pretty out of the norm with me... We normally always say goodnight before bed and say we love each other but this past week it just hasn't really happened, I've said it but it's not been reciprocated at all. On top of this there's been this guy she's been talking to [26M] who she says used to be nice but then got weird and sends her nudes all the time but she has never told him to leave her alone. As well as that, she doesn't like being known as my girlfriend or that I'm her boyfriend even though we do all the stuff, spend time together, go on dates etc. But she changes so much around our friends, and this has not just been recently this has been since we started speaking to each other. This comes then today, she was at my house and she tried to initiate sex, after messaging the guy, I said no because I thought something had happened in the messages but she insists all the time that he's the only one being weird. Shortly after I apologised because I didn't want it to seem like I didn't want her and then she broke down crying saying that it was because she was gonna miss me a lot when she went to uni, but the thing is that she's never done anything like it before, whenever I've been upset she's always been comforting and said that we'd still see each other, so that prompted me to think further that something had been said in the messages and she'd acknowledged that I realised. She's now at home and flaming me for apologising and wanting a reason to initiate it, when before she did, nothing was going on, I'd went to get us a drink and we'd actually had sex about 2 hours before and both gotten off. I'm really confused about what's going on, please help.

TL;DR: My 6-month-old "girlfriend" has been acting weird, not saying goodnight, not reciprocating love, talking to a guy who sends nudes, doesn't like being known as my girlfriend, and initiated sex at my house after messaging the guy. I'm confused and worried.

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. "Dude, it sounds like she's got some major issues. I'd say it's time to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. You deserve better than someone who's not being honest with you and is clearly not interested in being in a healthy relationship with you."
2. "I think you're overthinking this. She's probably just stressed with school and stuff, and the guy she's talking to is just a friend. Don't read too much into it. Just have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see where it goes."
3. "I'm no expert, but it sounds like she's got some boundary issues. She's not comfortable with being in a relationship, but she's not willing to have an honest conversation about it either. You deserve someone who's willing to communicate openly and honestly with you. I'd say it's time to re-evaluate the relationship and see if it's worth continuing."
4. "I think you should take a break from the relationship and focus on yourself for a bit. You deserve someone who's going to be honest with you and treat you with respect. Don't waste your time on someone who's not willing to do that."
5. "I'm not sure what's going on, but it sounds like she's got some major trust issues. You deserve someone who's going to be honest with you and trust you. I'd say it's time to re-evaluate the relationship and see if it's worth continuing."

These responses are a mix of advice, concern, and skepticism. Some users are urging the OP to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship, while others are suggesting that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend to clear up any misunderstandings. Some users are also expressing concern about the girlfriend's behavior and suggesting that the OP deserves better. Overall, the responses are trying to help the OP navigate the situation and make a decision about what to do next.

TITLE: Me [36F] with my "bff" [37F] She moved away and she always flakes on me when she's in town visiting other people.

POST: She and I have been friends since we were 8 or 9 years old. We went through a lot together and were even roommates for a few years and then she moved away.

Since she moved away, she has been consistently flaking out on me after saying she wants to see me, with all sorts of random reasons for doing so. When I had addressed this in the past, I was accused of being selfish and living in a bubble, whatever that's supposed to mean.

We reconciled a few months ago after she had taken my abusive mom's side during an argument we had, and she later apologized after someone else did the same to her. I really thought that things would get better, but in the past few months, she's been in town twice, left me for last in her planning and then - you guessed it - flaked on me. AGAIN.

My question is: should I just give up on this friendship? I'm so tired and hurt by this behaviour, and don't even know if she actually gives a shit about me, or what? Tired of getting my hopes up just to have them dashed an umpteenth time.

TL;DR: Long-time friend moved away, consistently flakes on me when she's in town, accused me of being selfish when I address it. Should I just give up on this friendship?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not making an effort to prioritize your friendship. If she's consistently flaking on you, it's probably because she's not interested in maintaining a close relationship with you. You deserve better than that."
* "I think you're being too patient. If someone consistently flakes on you, it's not about being selfish, it's about respecting your time and feelings. You deserve better than someone who can't be bothered to follow through on plans."
* "I think you should have a conversation with her about how her flaking is affecting you. Maybe she's not even aware of the impact she's having. But if she continues to flake, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a really toxic dynamic. You deserve a friend who respects and prioritizes your relationship. I think it's time to focus on nurturing other friendships that are more supportive and reliable."
* "I think you should take a step back and assess what you're getting out of this friendship. Are you getting more hurt than you're getting comforted? Are you feeling like you're always the one making an effort? If so, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship and prioritize your own emotional well-being."

TITLE: He says he's happy, but he knows I'm not what he wants

POST: Hey guys, 

I'm in a tricky situation.

I'm with a guy right now and we have a lot of fun together and we never fight and we have a great time together usually. 

He told me that he's happy with me right now and he's not sure how long it will last but he knows I'm not the kind of person he wants to marry one day... it really hurts. I feel like I'm not good enough. 

One day he asked me if I loved him, and I told him I do and when I asked if he loved me he said No. 

It was devastating. Am I self inflicting myself with this relationship? I love spending time with him. We laugh a lot... I'm hoping that if I can just show him the person I am that his feelings will change maybe and one day he'll realize I'm the one? 

I'm not saying I want to marry him, either. We havn't been together for very long but I do enjoy the time I have with him right now a lot. Am I just overthinking about the future? I go into relationships not wanting to waste my time - I'm looking for someone to love for the rest of my life... I hate jumping around. Soooo... am I just overreacting the future or should I step back from this thinking of "am I/will I ever be good enough?".. We're both very honest with eachother a lot and he shows symptoms of aspergers syndrome (I think he has it?) so I'm usually very blunt/honest with him as well as he is to me.

TL;DR: Guy says he's happy with me but knows I'm not what he wants long term. He doesn't love me back. I'm torn between enjoying the time we have and worrying about the future. Should I step back or keep going?

---

**Top comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's being very upfront with you about his feelings. If he's not in love with you and doesn't see a future with you, it's probably best to move on. You deserve someone who loves and wants to be with you for the long haul."
* "I think you're overthinking this. He's being honest with you, and you're being honest with him. If you're happy in the present, enjoy it. But don't delude yourself into thinking he's going to change his mind or magically fall in love with you. You deserve someone who loves you for who you are, not someone who's just tolerating you."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate what you want from this relationship. Are you staying because you're happy in the present, or are you holding onto hope that he'll change his mind? If it's the latter, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment. You deserve someone who loves and wants to be with you, not someone who's just using you as a placeholder."
* "I think you're being too focused on the future. Enjoy the present and don't worry about what might happen down the line. You can't control the future, but you can control how you feel in the present. If you're happy with him, then that's all that matters. Don't worry about what he wants or doesn't want. Worry about what you want and make sure you're getting that from the relationship."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. Tell him how you're feeling and see how he responds. If he's still not interested in a long-term commitment, then it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship. But don't give up on it just yet. You never know what might happen if you have a real conversation about your feelings."

TITLE: You shall not pass!

POST: I was driving home from work in San Antonio when I noticed this jerk in a sports car tailgating, honking, flashing lights, and in general being a major pest. We pulled up to a red light and he gunned it right through the intersection, somehow managing to not cause a major accident. I fumed for a bit but figured that was the end of it.

Ten minutes later I pulled into my apartment complex gate (it had one of those bars that raises and lowers after you put in a code) and there he was, idling next to it. I don't know if he was just visiting so didn't have the right entry numbers or what, but he was just waiting for someone to come in so he could slip by on their pass.

I pulled up to the gate, put my code in, and saw him inches from my bumper waiting to race in behind me. The gate raised up, I went forward, he followed intently, and I stopped with my rear bumper just barely in front of where the gate would fall.

He fumed in his front seat while I waved, the gate lowered blocking him out, and I pulled away happy.

TL;DR: Petty revenge: I blocked a jerk in a sports car from entering my apartment complex by stopping just short of the gate, leaving him stuck outside.

EDITS: None

COMMENTS:

* "That's a great way to handle a situation! I would've just gotten out and yelled at him"
* "I love how you didn't let him get the best of you. You got the last laugh"
* "I would've done the same thing. You showed him who's boss"
* "That's so satisfying! I'm glad you got to have the last word"
* "I'm sure he'll think twice before tailgating again"

This post is an example of petty revenge, where the author takes a small but satisfying action to get back at someone who has wronged them. In this case, the author blocks the jerk in the sports car from entering their apartment complex, leaving him stuck outside. The post is humorous and lighthearted, with many commenters praising the author's cleverness and satisfaction in getting the last laugh. The post is also a great example of how sometimes, a small act of revenge can be a fun and empowering way to deal with frustration and anger.

TITLE: Hey, r/loseit, what are our thoughts on supplementary pills like Slimquick or other "diet enhancers"?

POST: I know, I know. Eat healthy, exercise, and you'll be fine. Your weight will plateau sometimes but you'll just have to get over it (literally). Do your best, cut carbs, make life changes.

I've done those. I'm still working on them. But I was wondering if any of you have tried any supplementary diet pills (like Slimquick) and what you guys think of them. Do you think they would help? I'm particularly interested in them giving me some extra motivation - a reason to look back on the day and be like, "Well, you don't need to eat any more today - and that pill will help you even more!" sort of motivation.

What do you think? Any of you have experience with Slimquick or others? Please let me know, I've been debating this for a few weeks and I think I could use the pills as motivators. Or I'll just be out 20 - 30 bucks.

TL;DR: I'm considering using supplementary diet pills like Slimquick to help with motivation. Have any of you tried them? Do you think they would help? Any experience with Slimquick or other diet enhancers?

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: I used Slimquick for a few months and it didn't do anything for me. I mean, I didn't gain weight or anything, but I didn't lose any either. And the side effects were pretty annoying - jitters, headaches, the whole nine yards. I'd say it's a waste of money, honestly. Just focus on eating healthy and exercising, and you'll get there eventually.

2. **u/fitness_freak**: I've tried a few different diet pills, including Slimquick, and I have to say that they're all pretty much the same. They might give you a temporary energy boost or help suppress your appetite, but they're not going to magically make you lose weight. And the side effects can be pretty nasty. I'd recommend just sticking to a healthy diet and exercise routine. It might take longer, but it's worth it in the long run.

3. **u/healthnut**: I'm a big fan of supplements, but I have to say that diet pills are a bit of a mixed bag. Some people might find them helpful, but others might experience negative side effects. I'd recommend talking to a doctor or a registered dietitian before starting any new supplements, especially if you have any health concerns. And remember, supplements are meant to be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise routine - they're not a magic bullet.

4. **u/loseit_newbie**: I've been using Slimquick for a few weeks now, and I have to say that it's been helping me stay motivated. I know it's not a magic pill, but it's definitely given me an extra boost of energy and helped me cut back on snacking. I've also noticed that I'm sleeping better and feeling more focused throughout the day. Of course, everyone's experience is different, but I'd say it's worth a try if you're looking for a little extra help.

5. **u/fitness_coach**: I'm a personal trainer, and I have to say that I'm not a fan of diet pills. They can be dangerous, especially if you're not careful, and they're not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. I'd recommend focusing on making sustainable changes to your diet and exercise routine, rather than relying on supplements. And remember, the best way to lose weight is through a combination of healthy eating and regular exercise - there's no shortcut!

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [18F] recently found out her last boyfriend was cheating on her the entire time. I feel like a consolation suddenly.

POST: So my better half recently found her last boyfriend was cheating on her. This guy broke up with her by text and flaked on her constantly for 75% of the relationship (from what she told me) and she was suspicious of cheating the whole time. 

Since they broke up (January or so) he completely ignores her unless he asks for nudes/tries to hook up. 

But even so while they were dating she was desperate for his attention and validation. She recognized what she was doing sticking around was not healthy but she did it anyway. Really liked the guy. That's important information.

Anyway, so when she found out the other day that for the entire time he was seeing other people she got really down. Think it's entirely her fault. I'm trying to be supportive; being cheated on sucks. I've been telling her she's not to blame at all, etc etc. 

I've wondered why she picks up his calls when he tries to "apologize" (from what she told me he says it wasn't that big of a deal and she should give him a second chance) and I've asked her why she doesn't just delete him. She says she does but hours later she unblocks him or whatever. 

But what really *really* gets me is that he said he wants to redo last year and treat her right. She allegedly shoots him down and says she moved on to better things but it is driving me up the got-damn wall knowing he's trying to get her back under his thumb again.

Am I going bananas or is this something I should genuinely be concerned about?

TL;DR: My girlfriend's ex is trying to get back together with her after cheating on her the whole time. She's torn between being angry and wanting closure. I'm worried about her and feel like I'm being replaced as the "consolation prize".

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide valuable support and guidance for individuals navigating complex relationship issues. The OP (original poster) is understandably concerned about his girlfriend's feelings and behavior, and is seeking advice on how to best support her.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the situation, including the girlfriend's past relationship with her ex and her current feelings about him. The OP is also honest about his own feelings, acknowledging that he feels like a "consolation prize" and is worried about being replaced.

The community's response to this post is overwhelmingly supportive and helpful. Many users offer words of encouragement and validation, reminding the OP that his girlfriend's feelings are valid and that he should focus on supporting her rather than worrying about being replaced. Others provide practical advice, such as suggesting that the OP have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his concerns.

One user even shares a personal anecdote about their own experience with a similar situation, offering a unique perspective and insight. The community's response is a great example of how online forums can provide a sense of community and support for individuals navigating complex relationship issues.

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide valuable support and guidance for individuals navigating complex relationship issues.

TITLE: Should I cut deeply into my savings and pay off my student loan or keep paying in increments?

POST: I have ~11K in savings and a remaining balance of ~3K in student loans with a seemingly steep interest rate.  Even though I am 'paid ahead' until July of 2016, I am still incurring interest hits with each payment (generally pay $100/month towards the loan and about 87 goes towards principal and the remaining is interest).  Should I go ahead and pay off my remaining balance of 3K now, leaving me with 8K in savings?

Things to consider: I just moved across the country for grad school.  I am currently unemployed and seeking work.  I can (and probably will have to) take another loan out for grad school in the next two months.  So I wouldn't be flat broke if any major expenses came up.   The only main concerns I have to worry about (aside from standard bills and insurance) are rent of ~625/mo, a dog who is now 7, and a 1999 car which seems to be surviving ok right now, but who knows.

TL;DR: Should I pay off my 3K student loan now, leaving me with 8K in savings, or continue paying in increments and keep my savings intact?

---

**Comments:**

* **u/throwaway12345**: "I would say pay off the student loan. The interest rate is steep, and you're not earning much on your savings. You can always rebuild your savings after you're done with grad school."
* **u/savvy_spender**: "I agree with throwaway12345. The interest rate on your student loan is likely higher than the interest rate you could earn on your savings. Paying off the loan now will save you money in the long run."
* **u/budget_nerd**: "I would say it depends on your overall financial situation. Since you're unemployed and seeking work, it might be a good idea to keep some savings on hand in case you need it. You could also consider consolidating your student loan to a lower interest rate, which might make it more manageable."
* **u/financialfreedom**: "I would say pay off the student loan, but also consider building up an emergency fund. You never know when unexpected expenses might come up, and you don't want to be stuck with no savings and a high-interest loan."
* **u/gradstudent**: "I'm in a similar situation, and I would say pay off the student loan. The interest rate is high, and you don't know what the future holds. It's better to be debt-free and have some savings on hand than to be stuck with a high-interest loan and no savings."

**Conclusion:**

The majority of commenters agree that paying off the student loan now is the best option, citing the high interest rate and the potential to save money in the long run. However, some commenters suggest considering the overall financial situation and building up an emergency fund before making a decision. Ultimately, the decision depends on the individual's specific circumstances and financial goals. The post author should weigh the pros and cons and consider their own financial situation before making a decision.

My grandma passed away today.   My brother says he needs about $15,000 to finish paying for this semester (? how that works I have no idea since it is July) and is really laying the guilt on thick -- he can't come to the funeral because he needs to stay and look for a job, he is so worried he won't be able to get a loan by the time this payment is due, etc.

This is much larger than any previous check I'd made at my grandmother's request.  I'm feeling very uncomfortable but don't know how or what to say to tell him no, I'm not going to to write a check she never told me to write.   Or how to deal with the fall out from my mom and dad, because I feel like they will be upset and not understand why I'm not OK with this.

TL;DR: My brother wants me to write a check from my recently deceased grandmother for $15,000 to pay for his semester. He's guilt-tripping me and I'm feeling uncomfortable and unsure of how to say no.

COMMENT 1:
OP, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable about this request. Here's a suggestion: you could tell your brother that you're still processing your grandmother's passing and need some time to figure out what she would have wanted. You could also mention that you're not sure if she would have wanted you to use her money for this specific purpose. This might give you some breathing room to think about it and come up with a more thoughtful response.

COMMENT 2:
I think you should be honest with your brother and tell him that you're not comfortable writing a check for that amount of money. You could also explain that you're still grieving and need some time to figure out what your grandmother would have wanted. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs during this difficult time.

TITLE: I [23f] need to have a serious conversation with my bf [23m] of two years about marriage and our future. What topics/comments/things to avoid at all costs?

POST: Hello, I do know I am on the young side of the spectrum to be considering marriage, but my boyfriend and I have been in an LDR (different countries, four hour flight away) for the past half year, and will continue to be for at least two more years, minimum. I feel that a serious conversation about marriage and our future is necessary soon. 

Now, for context, we started this relationship knowing that we would be an eventual LDR and with the assumption that we would probably get married in our mid-late twenties. However, we're about to hit a point in our lives where there might be a big change, depending on whether I get the job I applied for or not. i want to talk to him and figure out our options together. 

So this was how I thought I'd proceed. 

1. Tell him that I want to have a serious conversation about our future in general, and marriage (children, our own families), our values (religion, abortion, homosexuality), our finances (current and potential future), and our future(what happens if only one of us gets the job, what happens if neither of us get the job, can we survive the two year separation that's left, etc). 

2. Give him a few days warning so he has time to think about it. 

3. Sit down and have the conversation at home, cuddled on the couch, and with a beer each (only one each so we don't get drunk) and quiet music. 

However, are there any topics, questions, comments, or attitude to avoid (that is not blatantly obvious)? Or, are there any additional topics,questions we must go over?

TL;DR: I'm 23f, been in a 2-year LDR with my 23m boyfriend. We're about to hit a big change point in our lives and I want to have a serious conversation about marriage, our future, and our values. What topics, questions, and comments should I avoid, and what additional topics should we discuss?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **Avoid** talking about "what if" scenarios too much. Focus on your shared goals and values instead.
2. **Don't** assume he's on the same page as you. Give him space to share his thoughts and feelings.
3. **Be open-minded** about the possibility of a trial separation or a pause in the relationship if things get tough.
4. **Discuss** the importance of communication and trust in your relationship.
5. **Avoid** blaming or accusing language. Use "I" statements instead of "you" statements.
6. **Consider** having a joint goal-setting exercise to help you both visualize your future together.
7. **Don't** put too much pressure on the conversation. Remember that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.
8. **Talk about** your individual goals and aspirations, and how they might impact your relationship.
9. **Discuss** the possibility of a long-distance relationship after the initial separation ends.
10. **Remember** that this conversation is a starting point, not an endpoint. Be prepared to revisit and revisit your goals and values as your relationship evolves.

**Additional topics to discuss:**

1. **Financial planning**: How will you manage your finances during the separation, and what are your long-term financial goals?
2. **Career goals**: What are your individual career aspirations, and how might they impact your relationship?
3. **Family planning**: What are your thoughts on having children, and how will you balance work and family responsibilities?
4. **Communication**: How will you maintain open and honest communication during the separation, and what strategies will you use to stay connected?
5. **Trust**: How will you build and maintain trust in each other during the separation, and what will you do if trust is broken?
6. **Compromise**: How will you find common ground and compromise on issues that arise during the separation?
7. **Support**: How will you support each other through the challenges of the separation, and what resources will you use to stay connected and motivated?
8. **Reunification**: What are your plans for reuniting after the initial separation ends, and how will you make the transition back to being together?

TITLE: ex took me for granted, is now 'changing', and wants me back. Help?!

POST: My boyfriend (22) and I (22) had been dating for almost 4 years. There was a short breakup in there about 11 months ago in the Spring because I was unhappy/didn't feel appreciated/could no longer put up with his lengthy list of bad habits and his attitude. After that breakup he 'changed'. He did everything the way I pictured a relationship should be. So we got back together a few weeks later.

Fast forward to the Fall: He is back to his old habits but worse. But there are still good times so I ignore them. And our relationship continues. But come Winter, we just are not happy. So we break up about a week ago.

And then it all happens again. He 'changes'. He say's most of the change is because his doctor told him he needs to shape up, and he blamed most of our problem on the fact that he'd gotten fat and self conscious about that. Now he's running, and working out, and eating well, and stopping smoking, and is being more exciting and seems happier, and listening to me, and we have actual communication, and he shows affection, and sex (yes, we're broken up, I know it's bad and confusing), and he deleted his video games, and stopped sitting on reddit for endless hours(no offense, reddit). All the things that weren't there before.

He's doing what he did last time that worked to get me back last time again, but with much greater effort and what I think is more sincerity. 

I don't want to be a fool. It is nice spending time with him, now that everything is what I wanted in a relationship. But with us, it seems like we're better a bf/gf when we are broken up. I am really at a loss as to what to do. I don't want to not spend time with him. But I don't want to jump right back into it and repeat the cycle. Did he change, and is that change enough to make us work, or is this a failing relationship which is bound to be prolonged? Please, may I have some advice? I don't know what I want.

TL;DR: Ex took me for granted, broke up, 'changed', and now wants me back. He's doing all the things I want in a relationship, but I'm unsure if he's genuinely changed or if this is just a ploy to get me back.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's just trying to win you back because he knows he messed up. I'd take a step back and really think about what you want. Do you want someone who can change for you, or do you want someone who genuinely loves and respects you for who you are? Also, what are his motivations for changing? Is it because he genuinely wants to be a better partner, or is it because he wants you back?"
* "I think you're being too generous by giving him the benefit of the doubt. He's done this before, and it's likely he'll do it again. You deserve someone who will work on themselves and our relationship consistently, not just when they're trying to get you back."
* "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want. It's okay to take a break from the relationship and see if you can find happiness on your own. If you do, and you realize you don't want to be with him, then that's okay too. You deserve to be happy, regardless of whether it's with him or not."
* "I think it's great that he's making an effort to change, but you need to be honest with yourself about whether or not he's genuinely committed to being a better partner. Ask him about his motivations and what he plans to do to maintain these changes. If he's just doing it to get you back, then it's likely he'll revert back to his old habits once he's got you back."
* "I think you should take a chance and see where things go. If he's genuinely changed and is committed to being a better partner, then it could be worth giving it another shot. But if he's just trying to win you back, then you deserve someone who will work on themselves and our relationship consistently."

TITLE: (21f)Accidentally spilled out a drunken 'I think I love you' to my new boyfriend (21m). He handled it better than I did.

POST: My boyfriend and I just started dating a few days ago. He asked me out nye (super romantically, it was pretty adorable tbh)
We only recently met (2 months ago) but have ended up very close. I'm a very emotional person and he's very reserved and I'm cool with that. While super drunk last night in a total lapse of judgement I blurted out 'I think I love you' in kind of a half joking way (because obviously we still aren't THAT close being we've really just met) but it definitely caught him off guard and made him feel super uncomfortable. Being drunk I immediately went into 'holy shit I'm sorry wow that was stupid I'm an idiot' mode and got pretty upset, it's the first time I've gotten that way around him and It kind of spiraled into me feeling even more shitty about making him uncomfortable which in turn made him feel worse. He's an absolute sweetheart and was very honest with me, telling me he was uncomfortable with it but he's not thoroughly turned off from the fact I said it, just that he can't say it back. He hasn't had much relationship experience and I do know he does like me, but I also know that now I've compromised my calm and collected attitude and made myself look vulnerable, which leaves me with a lingering anxiety about how he's feeling and what he may not be saying. 

Everything is fine this morning, he kissed me goodbye and I went off to work and I'm going back to see him tonight, but I feel that I've thoroughly fucked everything up and can't really go back from this. Is this feeling in the pit of my stomach valid or am I just overreacting?

TL;DR: Accidentally said 'I think I love you' to my new boyfriend while drunk, he handled it better than I did, now I'm feeling anxious about how he's feeling and what he may not be saying.

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not the end of the world. You said something in the heat of the moment, and he handled it well. He's not turned off, and he's still willing to see you tonight. You're overreacting a bit, but it's understandable given the situation. Just relax, have a good time tonight, and talk to him about it if you need to."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's even more okay to apologize and move forward. He's not mad at you, and he's still willing to be with you. Just be yourself, and don't overthink it too much."
* "I'm a guy, and I have to say, it's kind of refreshing to see a girl being honest and vulnerable. It takes a lot of courage to admit your feelings, even if it was a drunken mistake. He's probably impressed that you were willing to take that risk. Just be yourself, and don't worry too much about it."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You said something in the moment, and it's not a big deal. He's not going to hold it against you, and he's still willing to be with you. Just relax, and enjoy the ride. You don't have to have all the answers right now."
* "I think you should talk to him about it tonight. Be honest with him about how you're feeling, and see how he responds. It might clear the air and help you both move forward. Just be open and honest, and don't be afraid to listen to his perspective as well."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my dating person [24 M] of ~5 months, wondering how to / if I can even ask him to delete nude vid I sent him

POST: Started dating one of my closest guy friends (known him since I was 5 years old) on in May this year. We hit it off great and generally we are happy together. He asked me for exclusivity, and I gave it. He hasn't directly asked me to be his girlfriend though, so I assume that we're just dating, exclusively.

I'm not the type to post a lot of pics of myself anywhere. It's a personal thing that I dislike doing. But he often asks for them. I usually just decline and tell him that if he wants to see me, I'll hang out with him in person/online (Skype and stuff). 

Then one day I got curious and made a < 30 second vid of me naked (just me showing off my body and playing with my tits/ass). I sent it to him and he really liked it. Mind you, I hesitated for several hours before sending that video. After a few days though, I began to realize why I never did those things in the past. I regret sending him it and ***I just want to have him delete the video for good, right away!***

I don't know how to do this. I don't even know if it's fair for me to. I just regret it so much (and needless to say, I will never do anything like this ever again).

TL;DR: Sent a nude video to my boyfriend and now regret it. Want him to delete it, but don't know how to ask him.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not alone in this feeling! I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your regrets and ask him to delete the video. Be honest about your feelings and why you're asking him to delete it. He might understand and respect your boundaries."
* "I think it's great that you're taking responsibility for your actions and wanting to correct them. However, before asking him to delete the video, consider why you sent it to him in the first place. Was it because you felt comfortable with him or was it because you were trying to impress him? Reflecting on your motivations might help you have a more meaningful conversation with him."
* "I'd say it's not fair to ask him to delete the video without having a conversation about it first. You should talk to him about why you're asking him to delete it and what you're hoping to achieve. It's possible that he might not want to delete it, and you should respect his decision if that's the case."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to make mistakes and send something you regret. The important thing is that you're taking responsibility for it and wanting to move forward. Just be honest with him and ask him to delete the video. He might be more understanding than you think."
* "I'd suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating your relationship. If you're already regretting sending him a nude video, it might be a sign that you're not comfortable with the level of intimacy in your relationship. You deserve to be with someone who respects your boundaries and makes you feel comfortable in your own skin."

TITLE: I [34M] am going to visit my friend [32F] in another state in a few weeks. There could be relationship potential, but when should I say something?

POST: So I'm going to visit a friend of mine in another state in a little over a month. We've been friends for over ten years and we've always gotten along really well. She's smart and she's attractive, we know how to make each other laugh and we have a lot in common. I think that there could be more than just a friendship here, there could be relationship potential.

A little background: This girl and I have known each other since college. She used to date one of my best friends, but we've known each other since before that relationship and have kept in touch since then. We drifted apart for a couple of years after they broke up but have gotten back in touch and have grown closer as friends over the last couple of years. I would have said something to her sooner, but I was in another relationship anyway until about two years ago and until know I've been reluctant to pursue someone my friend had dated.

The question is, when is the best time to bring this up? The tickets are purchased and I'll make the trip regardless. I have no doubt that it will be a fun visit either way. Should I say something before I get on the plane to go visit? Should I wait until I get there and can ask her in person? (Should I make a drunken pass and see how she reacts? :-P ) Help me figure out what to do!

TL;DR: I'm going to visit my friend in another state and I think there could be relationship potential. Should I say something before I go or wait until I get there? Help!

TITLE: I [21m] recently found out my semi-LDR girlfriend [19F] of a year has depression. She has started acting cold and uncaring when we are apart.

POST: Not really sure what advice im looking for.... am I overreacting? should i be worried she is fed up?  

Girlfriend is in college during the week and we only see each other on weekends when she is back home. About 3/4 weeks ago she was not answering my texts or just being very aloof with me. When we met up at the weekend she eventually admitted that she has had depression before and is going through it again so she wanted to break up because in the past she has treated her boyfriends like shit during these periods and didn't want to do that to me. I said no, thanked her for telling me what was happening and then said we would get through this rough patch.  

So since then she has gone from texting me and talking throughout the day to maybe getting a text or two in reply to something I sent during the day. I know this sounds stupid but we have ended almost all of our texts for the past year with an "x" but she is even rarely doing that now. She is even purposefully ignoring texts as I get the read notification and if i get a reply it can be hours later.  

One part I can't understand is, when we are together at weekends things seem almost normal as she seems happy to see me, we hang out, sleep together etc.  
We even talk about possibly moving out together in the summer.  

I know she told me she would be rough to deal with during this time but whenever I have asked whats up she says everything is fine. But I know during the times she is ignoring me she is actively talking to people on facebook/text etc.  

Apologies about the wall of text but this whole new behavior is driving me insane! And I don't know if Im worrying over nothing

TL;DR: Girlfriend has depression, has been acting cold and uncaring when we're apart, but seems normal when we're together. I'm worried she's fed up with me and I don't know what to do.

RESPONSES:

1. **OP, you're not overreacting.** It's understandable that you're worried about your girlfriend's behavior. Depression can be a challenging condition to navigate, and it's great that she's being open with you about it. However, it's also important to recognize that depression can affect people's behavior and communication styles. It's possible that she's struggling to cope with her emotions and is withdrawing from you as a way to cope. Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're there to support her and that you want to help her through this tough time.

2. **It's possible that she's not intentionally ignoring you.** Depression can affect people's ability to respond to messages or engage in conversations. It's possible that she's not ignoring you on purpose, but rather is struggling to muster the energy or motivation to respond. Try not to take it personally and focus on being supportive and understanding.

3. **You're not alone in this.** Many people struggle with depression, and it's not uncommon for those who are going through it to withdraw from their loved ones. It's great that you're recognizing the signs and are willing to support her. Remember that you can't fix her depression, but you can be there for her and offer emotional support.

4. **Have a conversation with her about boundaries.** It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and worried about your girlfriend's behavior. Have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and what you need from her in terms of communication and support. Let her know that you're there to support her, but you also need to feel connected and heard.

5. **Consider seeking professional help.** Depression is a serious condition that requires professional treatment. Encourage your girlfriend to seek help from a mental health professional, and offer to support her in the process. This can be a great way to help her manage her symptoms and improve her overall well-being.

6. **Remember that you can't control her behavior.** While you can offer support and encouragement, you can't control your girlfriend's behavior or emotions. Focus on being a supportive partner and let her know that you're there for her, but also prioritize your own emotional well-being.

7. **Take care of yourself.** Supporting a loved one with depression can be emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-care, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed. Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure to take care of yourself first.

TITLE: Reddit, Forrest needs your help identifying a genetic disease.  Calling those with superb internet skills and a passion for cute things. Pics inside.

POST: Four weeks ago, a mouse I adopted had six babies.  All the babies looked like [wrinkly pink jelly beans]  Nothing was amiss.  

Day 6 or so, we thought it was safe to [begin handling the babies]  All babies looked fit and healthy and [were all the same size]  It appeared as though they were having trouble moving their hind legs, but I chocked that up to them just learning to walk.  I noticed it especially in the dark grey-brown ones, but in hindsight, maybe I had been handling the same mouse every time thinking that they were different.  The only female was the white one, the rest were males, which made it even harder to differentiate between the three ones of the same color.

Once they really started growing hair and we handled them for hours at a time, we noticed [this guy]  Do you see anything odd about him?  How about if we [compare him to his brother]  At first we thought he was paralyzed, but it soon became clear that was not the case.  He could move his tail and his hind legs freely, but he didn't do it often.  When he did decide to move his legs, the movements were stiff.  He could curl his toes.  He used his whole leg like a flipper to push himself along the table.  We named him Forrest, after Forrest Gump, because he is a determined bugger who can't walk or do any mouse things as well as his brothers.  

Now, he is one third the size of his family.  He developed slower than the others after day 12; his eyes opened about 4 days later, he took the longest to wean, and he is the least adventurous (understandably). 

As with most random mouse pregnancies, there is a chance of the litter being a result of inbreeding.  His body size makes me think it's not an environmental or physical cause, which leads me to genetic disease.  Do his symptoms sound like anything you know about?  My google-fu has failed me, but I am only a trainee.  Thus, Forrest and I turn to you for help.

TL;DR: Mouse has a genetic disease, symptoms include stiff leg movements, slow growth, and small size.  Help identify the disease.

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. "I'm no expert, but I've seen some weird stuff online.  Have you considered checking out the Mouse Genome Informatics database?  They have a section on mouse genetic disorders.  You might also want to look into the Mammalian Genome Information Network.  They have a database of genetic disorders in mammals, including mice."
2. "I'm a geneticist, and I think I can help.  Based on the symptoms you described, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that Forrest might have a form of muscular dystrophy.  It's a group of genetic disorders that affect muscle function and can cause muscle weakness, stiffness, and wasting.  However, I'm not a mouse expert, so I could be totally off base.  You might want to consult with a mouse geneticist or a veterinarian who specializes in small animals."

TITLE: I feel like I'm going to be trapped in retail. Am I a failure?

POST: I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.

I'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.

I just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to). I just feel like a failure who doesn't know what to do.

TL;DR: I'm 25, still living with my parents, and stuck in retail. I've been trying to save money, but I have a big bill to pay off. I've been rejected from teaching abroad and I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. I feel like a failure who doesn't know what to do.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm not a failure! You're not alone in feeling stuck. I've been in similar shoes before. What's important is that you're taking steps to improve your situation. You're working on paying off that debt, you're applying to other jobs, and you're seeking help from a therapist. That's not failure, that's progress!

You know what? Retail can be a great stepping stone to other careers. You're gaining valuable skills like customer service, time management, and problem-solving. Those skills are transferable to many other industries. Don't give up on retail just yet. Keep applying to other jobs, and who knows, you might find something that's a better fit for you.

And hey, being 25 and still living with your parents isn't uncommon. Many people are in the same boat. It's not about being a failure, it's about being smart and making the most of your situation. You're doing just that.

Keep your head up, OP! You got this!

COMMENT 2:
OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in retail for years and I've always felt like I'm stuck in a rut. But here's the thing: retail is a great way to build skills and confidence. You're learning how to work with people, how to handle difficult situations, and how to stay organized. Those are skills that will serve you well in any career.

And don't give up on teaching just yet! You said you had a teaching job that was hell on earth, but that doesn't mean you're not cut out for teaching. Maybe you just need to find the right school or district. Keep applying and don't get discouraged.

As for living with your parents, I think it's great that you're being responsible and saving money. That's something to be proud of! And who knows, maybe you'll find a job that allows you to move out sooner rather than later.

Keep pushing forward, OP! You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling stuck. But I want to tell you that you're not alone. I've been in similar situations before, and it's tough. But here's the thing: you're taking steps to improve your situation. You're working on paying off debt, you're applying to other jobs, and you're seeking help from a therapist. That's not failure, that's progress!

And hey, being 25 and still living with your parents isn't the end of the world. Many people are in the same boat. It's not about being a failure, it's about being smart and making the most of your situation. You're doing just that.

Keep your head up, OP! You got this! And remember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just keep moving forward, and things will work out.

TITLE: I [19M] am having trouble dealing with my girlfriends [19F] helicopter parents and could really use some advice.

POST: So we are both college freshman and have a fantastic relationship (almost half a year in). But the only problem I have found in our relationship is her parents. College to me seems like when we become more independent and on our own. For me that is for sure the case and I love it. But **her parents are literally in everything she does**. She calls them and tells them about every class and assignment and then they usually and way to mean and tell her to study harder and do better. She sends them assignments to look over before submission. They shove religion down her throat when she doesn't want to be part of it. For Valentines day they send a few candies and the job listings section from a paper...

**They treat her like a child and make me feel like I am dating a child.**

^ That is pretty much the main problem. I feel like I am becoming an adult and moving to the next stage and then there is her parents pretty much babying her through everything. **I know for a fact if we want to move into together in a couple years it will be a matter of asking for their permission rather than "We decided to move in" which is insane to me.** An important factor I think is that they are rather well off and pay for all her things, including all college expenses. She has never had a job. I am from a poor family and worked my way here which makes me feel like we are different somehow. Any advice could help me so much, thank you.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's helicopter parents are super controlling and make me feel like I'm dating a child. They're always involved in her life, treat her like a child, and make me feel like I'm not good enough for her. I'm from a poor family and worked my way to college, which makes me feel like we're different. Any advice would be appreciated.

**This post is a great example of how the subreddit r/relationships can provide a platform for individuals to share their personal struggles and receive advice and support from others who have experienced similar situations. The OP (original poster) is seeking advice on how to navigate his girlfriend's overbearing parents and how to deal with the feelings of inadequacy that come with it. The post is well-written and provides a clear and concise description of the situation, making it easy for readers to understand and offer helpful advice.**


**Some possible responses to this post could include:**

* "Have you talked to your girlfriend about how her parents are making you feel? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns."
* "It might be helpful to set boundaries with her parents and establish some independence in your relationship. You could suggest doing things on your own or with friends without her parents' involvement."
* "It's understandable that you feel like you're from different backgrounds, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. You can use your differences to learn from each other and grow as individuals."
* "It might be helpful to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that you have in common with your girlfriend. Try to focus on the present moment and the future you're building together, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about what might happen in the future."

**Overall, this post is a great example of how the subreddit r/relationships can provide a platform for individuals to share their personal struggles and receive advice and support from others who have experienced similar situations.**

TITLE: I (23/F) have been dating an inexperienced dater (23/M) and I have no idea what's going on.

POST: So, we met on the ever popular OKCupid about a month ago, and have been on around 8 dates since. On our second date we ended up going home together, and having sex, but there was no awkwardness afterwards and arranged another date over coffee in the morning. 

On Thursday last week, we had a bit of a "where is this going?" conversation, in which he confessed he's never really had a relationship or dated extensively. I have dated and had relationships in the past, so understand that it's a bit of an awkward new world for some people. I'm really into him, but he doesn't seem available outside of face to face dating. When we're together we have a great time, lots of fun and good conversations, but when we're apart he ignores my texts, doesn't speak to me often and seems bored when I attempt to strike up a conversation. It's leaving me a little confused and frustrated.

TL;DR: I'm dating an inexperienced dater, we have a great time together, but he's not very communicative when we're apart and I'm not sure what's going on or what he wants.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think I can relate to this situation. I was in a similar situation with someone who was also inexperienced with dating. What I realized was that they didn't know how to navigate the 'in between' phase of dating. They didn't know how to balance the excitement of a new relationship with the reality of everyday life. It might be worth having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and needs. Let him know that you're enjoying the time you spend together, but you also need some communication and attention when you're apart. It might be a learning experience for both of you!"
2. **DatingCoach**: "OP, it sounds like you're dealing with a classic case of 'new relationship energy' vs. 'everyday life'. It's not uncommon for people who are new to dating to get caught up in the excitement of a new relationship and forget about the importance of communication and attention outside of face-to-face interactions. I would suggest having a conversation with him about your needs and boundaries. Let him know that you value the time you spend together, but you also need some regular communication and attention to feel connected. It might be helpful to set some ground rules for your relationship, such as regular check-ins or texting each other during the day. Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try not to place too much pressure on him. Good luck!"
3. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it sounds like you're dating a bit of a flake. If someone is consistently ignoring your texts and not making an effort to communicate when you're apart, it's a red flag. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this relationship is worth your time and energy. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize communication and attention. Don't get me wrong, it's great that you're having fun together, but if the foundation of the relationship is shaky, it's not going to last."
4. **RelationshipRookie**: "OP, I'm a bit of a newbie to dating myself, but I've learned that communication is key. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and confused because you're not getting the attention and communication you need. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and needs. Let him know that you value the time you spend together, but you also need some regular communication and attention to feel connected. It might be helpful to set some ground rules for your relationship, such as regular check-ins or texting each other during the day. Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try not to place too much pressure on him. Good luck, and I hope things work out for you!"



**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all so much for your thoughtful and honest comments! I really appreciate your perspectives and advice. I think I'm going to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation, and maybe have a conversation with him about my feelings and needs. I'm hoping that we can work through this and build a stronger connection. Thanks again for your help and support!"



**Additional Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "OP, I'm glad you're considering having a conversation with him. Remember to approach it with empathy and understanding, and try not to place too much pressure on him. It's okay if he doesn't have all the answers, and it's okay if he needs time to figure things out. Just be open and honest about your feelings and needs, and see where it takes you."
2. **DatingCoach**: "OP, I'm glad you're considering having a conversation with him. Remember to set clear boundaries and expectations, and don't be afraid to walk away if he's not willing to meet you halfway. You deserve better than someone who doesn't prioritize communication and attention. Good luck, and I hope things work out for you!"
3. **SarcasticSally**: "OP, I'm glad you're taking my advice to heart. Remember, you deserve better than someone who's not willing to put in the effort. Don't settle for someone who's not willing to communicate and prioritize your needs. You're worth more than that!"



**Conclusion:**

The original poster's question sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with users offering a range of advice and perspectives. The comments highlighted the importance of communication, empathy, and setting clear boundaries in relationships. The original poster's response indicated that they were considering having a conversation with their partner and re-evaluating the situation. The additional comments

TITLE: I [27 F] can't get over the fact that my SO [28 M] of three years had a pet name for his ex but not for me

POST: I know this is probably an irrational worry/concern because aside from this "little" thing, we have a great relationship. 

Somewhat early on in the relationship I found out from old facebook posts/albums that my SO had a pet name for his ex with whom he had an LDR for about half of the time they spent as a couple (about two years). He used to call her his "kitty". I love nicknames and terms of endearment like this. It makes me feel special and close to another person when they call me something other than my given name. My SO and I have been together for three years but he's never even tried calling me anything other than my name. I've already told him how I feel about pet names but still, nothing. I've even tried calling him silly or cute names but nothing has ever really stuck. I'm at the point where I don't really want to force it because I feel like stuff like that should come naturally. Which makes the whole ex-pet-name thing something that's bothered me for the longest time. He doesn't know that I know (because at this point I feel like it would be creepy to bring it up). Also, the name "kitty" really gets me because he loves cats. (not surprising, I know) So much so that every time that he sees one he'll say "kitty" in almost a baby-talk cutesy voice. 

So I guess I'm feeling like I'm not as special/close/precious to him as his ex was just because he doesn't have a pet name for me. I don't know if it's even worth talking about with him because as I said, everything else is great and it's not that I don't feel loved... my scumbag brain just won't leave me alone about it :(

TL;DR: My SO has a pet name for his ex but not for me, and it's been bothering me for a long time. I don't know if it's worth bringing up or if I'm just being irrational.

COMMENTS:

* OP, you're not being irrational at all. It's a valid concern. You deserve to feel special and loved in your relationship, and if your SO can't even be bothered to give you a pet name, that's a red flag. Don't worry about being creepy for bringing it up, just have an open and honest conversation with him about how you feel.
* I think it's great that you're acknowledging that everything else in your relationship is great, but it's okay to have some concerns and worries. It's normal to feel insecure or unsure about things in a relationship. Just remember that your SO's lack of pet names for you doesn't define your worth as a person or your relationship.
* OP, I think you should talk to your SO about this. It's not about being jealous of his ex or trying to one-up her, it's about feeling seen and loved in your relationship. You deserve to feel special and cherished, and if your SO can't give you that, then maybe you need to reevaluate the relationship.
* I'm a guy and I can tell you that pet names are a big deal for us too. If your SO isn't making an effort to give you a special name, it might be because he's not as invested in the relationship as you are. Don't be afraid to have a conversation with him about it and see how he responds. If he's not willing to work on it, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship.
* OP, I think you should try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and not let this one thing get to you. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's normal to have some insecurities in a relationship. Just remember that your SO loves you for who you are, and that's what matters most.

Overall, the comments are supportive and encouraging, with many people acknowledging that the OP's concern is valid and that it's okay to have worries and insecurities in a relationship. Many people suggest having an open and honest conversation with the SO about how the OP feels, and that it's not about being jealous of the ex or trying to one-up her, but about feeling seen and loved in the relationship. Some people also suggest focusing on the positive aspects of the relationship and not letting this one thing get to the OP.

TITLE: Question about work. I may be in trouble.

POST: Here is what happened... 

I have been working at a company for 3 weeks. I was assigned a project by my boss's boss's boss who never gave me a due date. While I was working on the project, my boss's boss told me that I should have someone look it over before turning it in.

The next week I sent an email to my boss's boss's boss (the big man) giving him a short answer in case he needed it right away. Later that day I had finished editing my project. At the end of the day, the big man told me "I look forward to reading your project," while he was walking out the door. I panicked and sent him my project. 

The next day my boss asked me if I had sent the big man my project and I said yes. She told me that her boss (my boss's boss) told her that all my work had to go through her. 

I want to ask reddit

A. Does anyone think I will get fired for this?
B. What would you have done differently to avoid this situation?

TL;DR: New employee sent project to big boss without going through boss's boss, now worried about getting fired.

**Comments:**

A. Does anyone think I will get fired for this?

* "Honestly, it's not the end of the world. You made a mistake, but it's not like you intentionally tried to bypass protocols. Just own up to it, apologize, and move forward. You might get a talking-to, but I doubt you'll get fired." - u/throwaway123456
* "I think you'll be okay. It's a rookie mistake, and it's not like you're trying to hide anything. Just make sure to follow the proper channels from now on." - u/tech_noob
* "I'd say you're probably in trouble. You didn't follow the chain of command, and that's a big no-no in most companies. Just hope your boss is understanding and willing to work with you to fix the situation." - u/careeradvice

B. What would you have done differently to avoid this situation?

* "I would have asked your boss's boss for a due date and clarification on the review process before starting the project. That way, you would have known what was expected of you." - u/projectmanager
* "I would have sent the project to your boss's boss's boss, but also CC'd your boss's boss to keep them in the loop. That way, you're covering your bases and showing that you're trying to follow the proper channels." - u/officepolitics
* "I would have asked your boss for guidance on the project before sending it to the big boss. That way, you would have had a better understanding of what was expected and could have avoided the mistake." - u/newbieinbusiness

**Reddit's response:** The comments on this post are a mix of advice and reassurance. Some users think the OP will be okay and that it's just a rookie mistake, while others think they're in trouble and should be prepared for a talking-to or even termination. The advice given ranges from "own up to it and move forward" to "follow the proper channels from now on." The users also suggest that the OP should have asked for clarification on the review process and due date before starting the project, and that they should have kept their boss's boss in the loop. Overall, the response is supportive and helpful, with users offering words of caution and advice to help the OP navigate the situation.

TITLE: How can I keep my parents' cigarette smoke off of me on my way to a college scholarship day, where I will be interviewed?

POST: This Saturday (Feb. 8) my parents and I will be driving to the college that I will be attending this fall, which is about an hour and a half drive from home, give or take. My parents have been smokers for my whole life, so I am pretty desensitized to the smell, but many instructors and just random bystanders have commented about the scent on my person. This will not make a good impression on the committee (at least I think it is a committee. either way, it will be noticeable). I tried to ask very nicely if at least my mom would consider not smoking, but she kind of laughed at me and made a bunch of rude, sarcastic comments about how it's not really that noticeable, and my character should be enough to win over the interviewers. 1. My personality is not the best, and I'm not too great at interviews and 2. If the competition is tough, I am pretty sure that it WILL go down to the first impression that is given, and the smell of cigarettes is NOT going to give a good impression, even if I apologized and that my parents were smokers.

Some suggestions that I have been given by instructors/counselors include: chewing cinnamon gum, packing my clothes and covering my hair until I get there (which I'm not too keen on, because I don't know where I would really change or anything like that), and putting cooking vanilla in the car? I'm not too sure about that one. Will any of these work? Other suggestions are very welcome.

TL;DR: I'm going to a college scholarship interview and I'm worried about the smell of my parents' cigarette smoke on me. I've tried asking them to not smoke, but they're not listening. What can I do to minimize the smell?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "I'm a smoker myself, but I understand your concern. Have you considered asking your parents to roll down their windows while driving? It might not eliminate the smell entirely, but it could help reduce it. Additionally, you could bring some air fresheners or scented sprays with you to use before the interview. Just be sure to choose a scent that's not overpowering or distracting."
2. **u/CollegeBound2020**: "I'm a college student and I can attest that cigarette smoke can be a major turn-off. I would suggest talking to your parents again and explaining how important this interview is to you. Maybe they'll understand your perspective better this time around. If not, you could consider asking a trusted family member or friend to drive you to the interview instead. Good luck!"
3. **u/SmokyMcSmokesalot**: "I'm a smoker and I feel your pain. Unfortunately, there's no magic solution to eliminate the smell entirely, but you could try using a scented spray or perfume to mask it. Just be sure to choose a scent that's not too strong or overpowering. You could also consider wearing clothes that are easy to wash and change into before the interview. Good luck with your interview, and I hope you get the scholarship!"
4. **u/AskRedditMod**: "I'm a mod here on AskReddit, and I have to say, I'm impressed by your concern for making a good impression. It's great that you're thinking about this ahead of time. I would suggest talking to your parents again and explaining your concerns in a calm and respectful manner. If they're still not willing to listen, you could consider asking a trusted family member or friend to drive you to the interview instead. Good luck, and I hope you get the scholarship!"

TITLE: How can I tell if She [22/F] is uninterested or just shy after first date with Me [22/M].

POST: I've just come out of a 4 year relationships a month later set up a date with a girl I've had previous dates with. Our previous dates were always a bit awkward because we were both nervous and I've always found it hard to talk to the opposite sex (so lots of silence).

So I began talking to her again last week and I decided not to beat around the bush and asked if she wanted to catch up for coffee to which she agreed. So the beginning of the date kind of started awkward i found her eyes kept moving around the room and wouldn't keep eye contact for long, there were moments of short awkward pauses like before, she asked me questions about my family and about other things but I felt I was asking her more questions. The second half i felt we became more comfortable she kept moving her hair behind her ear, would smile more and kept eye contact more and we ended up talking straight for just over an hour. But after the date was over I feel disconnected or not reaching the level of intimacy that I feel i should've.

I'm not sure if because of my low self esteem/ confidence of a bad breakup I'm overthinking or over expecting things or seeing shyness as being bored or uninterested, Or if shes sending me hints she wants to just be friends.

Also is it appropriate to send the night of the date a "I had a great time, we should catch up again soon" message?

TL;DR: Had a first date with a girl I've had previous dates with, felt like it was going well but ended up feeling disconnected. Is she just shy or uninterested? Should I send a follow-up message?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think you're overthinking it. It sounds like she was just shy and nervous, which is totally normal on a first date. The fact that she kept moving her hair behind her ear and smiled more towards the end suggests she was feeling more comfortable. Don't overanalyze it and just see where things go. Send her a 'had a great time' message and see if she responds positively."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the above comment. It's possible she was just shy and nervous, but it's also possible she's interested and just needs a little more time to open up. Instead of overthinking it, try to focus on the positive aspects of the date and see if you can build on that. Don't send a follow-up message just yet, let her make the next move."
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to be a little awkward on a first date, and it's normal for people to take time to warm up. The fact that you both ended up talking for over an hour suggests you had a good connection. Just relax and see where things go. And yeah, send her a 'had a great time' message, it's a nice way to keep the conversation going."
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're overestimating the importance of eye contact. It's not always a guarantee of interest or intimacy. What matters more is the quality of the conversation and the connection you felt. It sounds like you both had a good time and there's potential for something more. Don't overanalyze it and just enjoy the process."
5. **u/throwaway789**: "I think you're being too focused on the negative aspects of the date. Try to focus on the positive and see if you can build on that. And yeah, send her a 'had a great time' message, it's a nice way to keep the conversation going and show your interest."

TITLE: Misuse of plates/unregistered vehicle in Massachusetts.

POST: Recently I was pulled over while driving an unregistered vehicle with another vehicle's plates on it in MA while driving from NY to CT.  

My mom had bought the car a couple days prior and was having issues getting temporary registration so the plates from another one of our cars was put on it temporarily so it could be driven to CT and gotten registered.  I went so that both the car driven up there and the "new" (used) car could be driven back.

When I was pulled over I was issued a written warning for passing at an unsafe speed (definitely my fault as I made the large mistake of slowing down while passing another car because I saw a police officer) and for "unregistered MV".  The officer took the plates and the car had to get towed.

I have the number of the tow company so I/my mom can return and get the car after paying for the tow (I don't believe the car was impounded but if it was then I suppose we have to take care of that too) and getting temporary plates in CT.

What I haven't been able to figure out by asking Google is how to get our old plates back and what repercussions we'll be facing.  We've been trying to get through via phone to the police station in the town I was pulled over in but we've had no luck so far.  If anyone has any suggestions/answers on how to get the old plates back/get us able to drive our old car again and what we'll have to do (what fees or other legal problems can we expect) I'd be way appreciative.

TL;DR: Pulled over in MA for unregistered vehicle with another plate on it. Got a written warning and the car was towed. Need help figuring out how to get old plates back and what repercussions we'll face.

---

**Legal Advice:**

1. **Contact the police station:** Try contacting the police station again, and ask to speak with the officer who issued the warning. Provide them with the details of the situation and ask how to proceed with getting the plates back.
2. **MA RMV:** Reach out to the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) and explain the situation. They may be able to provide guidance on how to obtain temporary plates and get the car registered.
3. **Tow company:** Contact the tow company and ask about the status of the car and what you need to do to retrieve it.
4. **Fines and fees:** You may be facing fines and fees for the unregistered vehicle and the misuse of plates. Be prepared to pay these when you retrieve the car.
5. **Insurance:** Check with your insurance provider to see if they will cover the car while it's being registered and whether you need to notify them of the change.
6. **Registration:** Once you've obtained temporary plates, you'll need to register the car with the MA RMV. You may need to provide proof of insurance, proof of identity, and proof of Massachusetts residency.
7. **Court appearance:** Depending on the severity of the situation, you may be required to appear in court to face charges related to the unregistered vehicle and misuse of plates.

**Additional Tips:**

* Be honest and cooperative with the authorities and RMV. Providing false information or attempting to conceal the truth can lead to more severe consequences.
* Keep records of all correspondence and interactions with the police, RMV, and tow company.
* Consider consulting with an attorney if you're unsure about the legal implications or if you're facing multiple charges.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and follow the law when it comes to vehicle registration and insurance. Take this opportunity to get the car registered and ensure you're in compliance with MA regulations. Good luck!

But the other day I came to the realization that she looks ALOT like my mom.  They both have short curly hair and similar figures.  My moms skin is alot lighter, and she is a bit shorter...  Buuuut, I can't get it out of my head now.

TITLE: [23M] I fucked up hard

POST: Met up with 22F I've known for 8 years and liked for most of that duration (feeling has been mutual in the past, not sure about now). Noticed a bodily feature that is not normal (I brought it up because I thought it was fucking cool, I think she is the most beautiful girl in the world FFS) and mentioned it. She is super shy and stuff but even then she reacted really coldly to my remark, but I changed the subject. That was on Friday, and now I get up at 3AM to find a facebook msg from her older sister (like 26 or 27) where she is literally fucking yelling at me for hurting her lil sister by pointing that out and how she deserves better than this. I know for a fact that if this is what is coming from her older sister (who doesn't show much emotion either), the girl I like is REALLY upset.

This is coming to me after I've spent last few days thinking about this girl and being lovesick to the point where I couldn't properly do anything besides lie in my bed punching pillows and reading love novels and shit. I don't know what to do at this point. I know I should apologize but, how far should I take this? Do I just apologize? Do I tell her she is pretty? Do I tell her how much my heart hurts every night thinking about her? Do I tell her she does deserve better than me? I'm clueless. Help me out.

TL;DR: I mentioned a bodily feature to a girl I've known for 8 years and liked for most of that duration, she reacted coldly, and now her older sister is yelling at me on Facebook for hurting her. I'm lovesick and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're a total idiot. You should've just kept your mouth shut. Now you've blown it. Just apologize and move on."
* "I think you're being a bit harsh. Maybe the girl just wasn't comfortable with you pointing out her bodily feature. Try apologizing and see if you can salvage the situation."
* "You're a 23-year-old man, for crying out loud! You should know better than to comment on someone's bodily feature. Just apologize and move on. You don't deserve her anyway."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her and explain how you felt. Maybe she was just taken aback by your comment and didn't know how to react. But yeah, apologizing is a good start."
* "You're a total creep, dude. You should've just kept your feelings to yourself. Now you've ruined any chance you had with her. Just leave her alone and move on."

**Top Comment:**

* "Dude, you're a total idiot. You should've just kept your mouth shut. Now you've blown it. Just apologize and move on." (123 upvotes)

**Subreddit's Response:**

* "This guy is a total moron. I mean, come on, you're 23 and you still don't know how to talk to girls? Get a grip, dude."
* "I feel bad for the girl. She's probably been dealing with this kind of crap her whole life. I hope she finds someone who actually respects her."
* "This is why I hate dating. It's all about avoiding awkward situations and not being a total creep. Good luck, dude. You're gonna need it." (14 upvotes)

**Conclusion:**

The subreddit is overwhelmingly against the OP, with many users calling him a "total idiot" and a "creep." The top comment suggests that he should just apologize and move on, while others recommend having a conversation with the girl to explain how he felt. However, the overall tone is one of disapproval and disappointment. The OP's mistake was commenting on the girl's bodily feature, which was seen as inappropriate and insensitive. The situation is likely to be difficult to salvage, and the OP may need to accept that he has blown his chance with the girl.

TITLE: I [19m] moved to London back in May, and facing a terrible situation

POST: I moved over here for work, into a house with 4 people already living there - The ad for the room said: Professionals only.

Another guy [36m] from Romania lives in the house, and wanted his wife and 3 kids to get into the house.

Our landlord [50m] Egyptian, accepted it as a way of 'helping his family over here', which we all said was OK.

Now it turns out, they plan on staying in the house until ATLEAST next summer - and we all pay the same rent and share bills (approx 1300$ a month)

To make it even worse, his 3 kids [1/3/4] are ALWAYS awake until midnight, sometimes later, and they are so noisy it wakes me up all the time throughout my sleep, and causes too big of an exhaustion to go to work.

Our landlord put the father on the council papers and contract, and since we're too many living in the house, I'm not able to get on the contract.

What would the best solution be to actually get his kids to shut it this late?

So far I've recorded the last 3 nights - 10 minutes in the hallway, 15 minutes in my room, with constant noise from the kid - Is there anything else I can do to make our Landlord realise that it's just not okay.

I don't have the money for the deposit to get another room somewhere elsez

TL;DR: I'm living in a shared house with 4 people, including a family with 3 kids who are always awake until midnight and causing a huge disturbance. I've tried recording the noise, but what else can I do to get the landlord to take action?

This post is a great example of how to share a personal and frustrating situation on Reddit. The OP (original poster) provides a clear and concise summary of the issue, including the relevant details and their concerns. They also show that they've already taken some steps to address the problem (recording the noise), which demonstrates their proactive approach.

The post is well-structured, with a clear title that summarizes the issue, and a brief introduction that sets the context. The OP also uses a conversational tone, which makes the post easy to read and understand.

The post also includes a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) section, which is a great way to summarize the main point of the post for readers who may not have the time to read the entire post.

Overall, this post is a great example of how to share a personal and frustrating situation on Reddit, and how to get help and support from the community.

TITLE: Im a [21 F] at my wit's end and in desperate need of advice for my relationship with [21 M] boyfriend of almost 4 years; is it time to move on and how the ef do I even begin to do so?

POST: How do you break up with someone if they are the only person you've been close to in the past 4 years, if they have a shit family or no place to really call home? I am afraid I will ruin him. I can't think of life without him yet I feel we are toxic to each other.

My parents do not approve of him, say he brings nothing to the table for me and that I am not responsible for his life. It has put so much strain on our relationship throughout the years and I have found myself exhausted. Their strict rules have also been extremely troublesome/stressful for us and I am often pushed to my limits in order to maintain a balanced relationship between family and bf but more often than not one of them suffers.

I do not know if I'm trying to make things work between us because I feel guilty and responsible for him, or if I'm just afraid of what will happen if I let him go, or if we are actually meant to stay together and work through these hard times. Things have escalated in the past few weeks and this fate has become more imminent than ever. His unstable living situation is putting so much stress on the both of us. We have dealt with distance for the past 3 years horribly. I play a division 1 sport in college and have a ridiculous schedule while he has not been able to hold down a job for more than two months because of unfortunate variables relating to his shitty living situation. It will be a huge pivoting point in both of our lives if things end but I feel as if we are stuck in some awful loop of shitty circumstance and I do not know how to get out of it.

I'm sorry if this sounds pathetic this is the first time I've tried writing this. I really have no one to talk to and am in desperate need of advice. 

I am at my wits end. He is so important to me and I just want to do what will be best for both of us in the end.

TL;DR: 21 F, 4 year relationship with 21 M, struggling with toxic dynamic, family disapproval, and uncertainty about breaking up. Need advice on how to move forward and what the best decision is for both parties.

* "I think you're trying to make things work because you feel guilty and responsible for him. But you can't fix his problems or make his life better.

* "I think you should take some time to reflect on what you want from the relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your deal-breakers? Write down your thoughts and feelings. Sometimes putting things into words can help clarify things. You might also consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns." (15 upvotes)
* "I think you're being too focused on what others think. Your parents might not approve of him, but that's their problem, not yours. You need to focus on what makes you happy and fulfilled. If you feel like the relationship is toxic or holding you back, it might be time to reevaluate. Remember, you deserve to be happy and respected." (12 upvotes)

TITLE: [22] and pregnant, what would you do?

POST: I'm a moderately high achieving community college student and president of a club.

I'm currently eligible for three AA degrees, my plan is to get my Bachelor's in zoology, then go to vet school.

/endbrag

All signs point to not having this baby right?

My boyfriend of four years is super supportive and really wants to have this baby. He said he would do everything he can so I don't have to stop going to school. However he said he would support me with whatever decision I make.

Currently I live with my parents, I expect to get kicked out which wouldn't be terrible I guess because my boyfriend and his family are moving up north closer to the school I want to transfer to.

TL;DR: I'm 22, pregnant, and unsure what to do. I'm a student, I want to finish my degree and go to vet school, but I'm also scared of being a single mom and not being able to provide for my child.

TITLE: I could be the other guy [26M]. She [25 F] wants me, but has a boyfriend (now long distance) of almost 3 years. I need opinions on what I should do

POST: I will try to be brief.
We met, we went out 2-3 times, great chemistry but at time I could feel she would give me mixed signals. I held back, eventually (after 4 dates) asked her to dinner to my place while I made it obvious what my intentions were... she told me about BF... I could see it coming but didnt blame her for it, since our first few dates could have been interpreted as friendly ones (.. as if she didnt know what was going on)... I told her I respect that and backed off. She said shes struggling with it so naturally I have kept myself around, but have not been looking for her, yet we text a couple times a week, and have hung out a few times after that...

Current situation is

- she knows i like her
- I know she likes me
- last time we hung out and i dropped her off she sent a message asking if shes a bad person for wanting to kiss me (i just avoided answering that and said something else related to the night, even though i wanted to say more)
- I am still assuming shes still with the guy. Havent texted or seen her since...

at what point would it be reasonable for me to put pressure on her again? do I just let it run its course and fucking suck it up as long as I can, do I wait for another situation where she clearly wants to be with me, and act on it?

I like this chick, and I feel that if she cheats on her bf with me, I will always have that in the back of my mind if I got in a relationship with her.... but at the same time, I dont wanna wait around indefinitely

TL;DR: Girl I like has a long distance boyfriend, we had chemistry, but she wants to be with me. I backed off, but still hang out/talk. Should I put pressure on her again or just wait?

**OPINIONS FROM THE SUBREDDIT COMMUNITY:**

* "You're not a bad guy for wanting to be with her, but you're not a good guy for not respecting her relationship. If you're not willing to wait for her to end things with her boyfriend, then you should just move on. You deserve better than to be the 'other guy'."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just infatuated with the idea of being with someone who's already taken? If it's the latter, then you should focus on building a connection with someone who's single and available."
* "It's not your job to pressure her into making a decision. If she's struggling with her feelings, that's on her, not you. You've already shown her that you respect her relationship, so just be patient and see how things play out. If she ends up choosing you, then that's her decision, but don't try to manipulate her into it."
* "I think you should have an honest conversation with her about your feelings and boundaries. Let her know that you're not looking to be the 'other guy' and that you need her to make a decision about her relationship. If she's not willing to end things with her boyfriend, then you should be prepared to walk away."
* "You're not doing anything wrong by wanting to be with her, but you're not doing anything right by not respecting her relationship either. You need to find a way to balance your feelings with your morals. If you can't do that, then you might want to re-evaluate your priorities."

**THE OP'S FOLLOW-UP POST:**

* "Thanks for all the opinions, guys! I think I've been stuck in this limbo for too long. I'm going to take a step back and focus on myself for a bit. I think I need to re-evaluate my feelings and priorities. I don't want to be the 'other guy' and I don't want to manipulate her into making a decision. I'll just have to wait and see how things play out. Thanks for the advice!"

TITLE: 22(F) and 29(M) Casually seeing each other, but he keeps asking me to go on romantic dates?

POST: Hi Reddit, long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway account. I am a 22 year-old female and he is a 29 year-old male. We have been casually seeing each other for about six weeks now.

We initially met through a friend at a bar, and things were awkward at first, but we ended up going for a late meal and hitting it off. After we met we began texting quite frequently (maybe once a day) and went on a few dates. We first slept with each other on the third date and it was great. Since then, we have gone on a few dates, that almost always end with us sleeping together. I consider all of this to be casual and we have never discussed a relationship or anything more. 
But here is my issue: he keeps asking me to go on all of these really nice, fancy dinner dates. I do enjoy his company but I do not want to pursue anything more than what we currently have going. He is attractive, generous, and sweet; but we do not seem to have an engaging connection and I got out of a very long and intense relationship at the beginning of the year (so I want some time to be single), among other reasons.
My question is: when would it be an appropriate time for me to bring up my concerns? He invited me to go on a date this week. Should I go and tell him there? Or should I decline and tell him right away that I think these dates are a bit much for our given situation? My personal philosophy has always been don't discuss being serious unless the other person brings it up. He has not brought it up. I guess my biggest concern is that he pays for our dates (I try to pay for my half or my drinks and he never lets me) and it seems unfair if I don't want to be official in the end. He is a great guy and I would like to continue seeing him without any strings attached.

TL;DR: 22F and 29M have been casually seeing each other for 6 weeks. He keeps asking me to go on romantic dates, but I don't want to pursue anything more than what we have. When should I bring up my concerns?

---

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think it's totally reasonable to have concerns about these dates. You've been clear about what you're looking for (casual) and he's not respecting that. I would suggest having a conversation with him about how you're feeling. You could say something like 'Hey, I really enjoy spending time with you, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not looking for anything serious right now. I know you've been inviting me on these nice dates, but I feel like it's putting pressure on our relationship. Can we just stick to hanging out and having fun like we have been?'"
* **u/relationship_advice**: "I agree with u/throwaway123456. It's not fair to keep taking him up on these dates if you're not interested in pursuing anything more. You should have the conversation with him and be honest about your feelings. It's better to be upfront and clear than to lead him on and potentially hurt him in the long run."
* **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think you should decline the date and have the conversation with him. You don't owe him an explanation, but you can say something like 'Hey, I appreciate the invite, but I'm not really feeling up for a fancy dinner date right now. I think we're good just hanging out and having fun like we have been.' If he's really interested in you, he'll respect your boundaries and not pressure you into something you're not comfortable with."
* **u/just_a_observer**: "I think you should be careful about how you approach this conversation. You don't want to come across as rude or dismissive, but you also don't want to lead him on. Maybe try to find a compromise? You could suggest doing something low-key, like grabbing coffee or going for a hike, instead of a fancy dinner date. That way, you're still spending time together, but you're not committing to anything too serious."

**OP's Follow-up:**

* **u/throwaway_account**: "Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'm going to take a combination of all your suggestions. I'll decline the date and have a conversation with him about my feelings. I'll try to be honest and clear, but also respectful. I'll suggest doing something low-key instead of a fancy dinner date. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!"

TITLE: For any Girls out there... Will you help me in my quest for knowledge?

POST: I'm a Soon To Be 18 Year Old male and I have always have had a urge to know "everything"... well, recently I've been wondering what it'd be like to live as a/be a girl. Now, I'm not homosexual in anyway, but my brain just hasn't let up on this simple fact of my urge to learn the "mysteries" of a man. Now, onto my question, Do any one of yall reading know if/how a man can grow breasts (I'm not looking for anything too big, just something to give me an idea). I don't want to do anything costly, I.E Implants, and I don't want to do anything to noticeable/permanent.

TL;DR: I'm a 17 year old male who wants to learn about being a girl, specifically about growing breasts without implants or permanent changes.

REPLIES:

* "Dude, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to change your body, why not try to understand what it's like to be a woman? Talk to some women, learn about their experiences, and try to be more empathetic. That's the best way to gain knowledge and understanding."
* "I'm a trans woman and I can tell you that growing breasts without implants is not possible. But, I can also tell you that it's not about the physical changes, it's about feeling comfortable in your own skin and being true to yourself. If you're feeling this urge, maybe you should explore your feelings and see if there's something deeper going on."
* "I'm not a medical professional, but I think it's important to note that growing breasts without implants or surgery is not a safe or recommended option. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being over your curiosity. Instead, why not try to learn more about the experiences of women and trans people? There are many resources available online and in your community that can help you gain a better understanding."

TITLE: Trying to keep my brother out of jail

POST: His ex-probation officer called him today to tell him he failed an etg (tests for alcohol consumed in past 72  hours) in April. It is now two months after he was supposed to have been off probation and he now finds out he has a warrant and is looking at a maximum of thirty days. 

So long story short I am trying to raise money for him so that maybe, with a slight bit of luck, I can cut down how many days he has to spend in jail after he is sentenced. Maybe pull the cool scene like in the movies where someone posts bond but he doesn't know who.

My goal is to buy wristbands and sell them for donations. We have A LOT of hoodlum friends in our city and I know I could at least make a couple hundred.

I guy what I am asking of you guys is what should I write? First instinct for me was "fuck cops-free (my bro)". But do you think people will hesitate to buy something like that or jump on it?

Also, any recommendations for who to go through or what type of wristband? I'm thinking the engraved ones like the livestrong ones so they last but they get pricey fast. I looked on Google but I kept feeling the first couple sites were trying real
 hard to fuck me

TL;DR: My brother is in trouble with the law and I'm trying to raise money to help him out. I want to sell wristbands with a message on them to raise money. What should I write on the wristbands and what type of wristband should I get?

TITLE: I'm [32 M] with a great [30 F] girl and I want to settle down but never stay satisfied with relationships more than a year or two

POST: My past three relationships have all been about 2 years, and I've ended all of them because of a combination of problems and me losing interest. 

The current girl I'm with has mostly everything I would want in a relationship - but I'm feeling myself starting to lose interest anyway. She does have a fairly bad jealousy problem, but some of it is warranted and I feel that everyone has to have some personal defects which should be forgiven.

One factor which I think contributes to feeling unsatisfied is that I tend to get what my friend calls a "wandering eye." Even though I'm happy with my gf I can't help noticing other girls around and being drawn to them, even catching myself flirting at times. A lot of it is sexual attraction and desire - it seems horrible but after being with my gf almost a year I'm less interested in sex and occasionally get a rush of excitement when I notice another girl showing interest in me. 

I could just date indefinitely but I do want to settle down and have kids. I just always get the feeling that I can't stay satisfied with my relationships, and if I'm getting this restlessness after only a year or two I can't imagine how it would be over the rest of my lifetime. 

An obvious answer would be to decide which is more important, dating different people or settling down, and then have the self control to stick to the decision. It's just that long term I *want* to settle down, but I can never escape the feeling of wanting to pursue other girls. A few years back I told someone older this and they said "you must not be ready," but I can't help feeling like this isn't going away, and I really would like to start a family.

TL;DR: I'm 32, been in three 2-year relationships, and I'm starting to lose interest in my current 30-year-old girlfriend due to jealousy issues and my own wandering eye. I want to settle down and have kids, but I can't seem to stay satisfied with relationships and I'm worried about the long-term implications.

---

This post is a great example of a common problem in relationships: the desire to settle down versus the desire to explore and be with different people. The OP (original poster) is struggling with his own desires and feelings, and is unsure of how to reconcile them.

The OP's concerns are valid, and it's understandable that he would want to settle down and have a family. However, his wandering eye and lack of interest in sex with his current girlfriend are significant issues that need to be addressed.

The OP's girlfriend's jealousy issues are also a concern, and it's important for him to consider whether he is willing and able to work through these issues with her.

Ultimately, the OP needs to take a step back and reflect on what he truly wants and needs in a relationship. He may need to have an honest conversation with himself and his girlfriend about his feelings and desires, and consider whether they are compatible with each other.

The post also highlights the importance of self-reflection and communication in relationships. The OP's struggles are a reminder that relationships require effort and commitment from both partners, and that it's okay to take the time to figure out what you want and need before making a decision.

The post has received many comments and responses, with some people offering advice and support, while others have shared their own experiences and perspectives. The post has also sparked a wider discussion about the challenges of relationships and the importance of communication and self-reflection.

TITLE: Thought I had an offer: Did my other recruiter screw me over?

POST: I've been working with a recruiter. I lost contact with him 1 month ago.
I applied to another job through recruiter #2. Had an interview last week, went very well. Expected an offer on Friday (that's when they said they would contact me)

Today I get a call from recruiter #1, asking me my situation. I tell him I might have an offer and may not need his services. He asks "mind if i ask which position and company?" I tell him (I don't know why I did).

A couple hours later, I get a call from recruiter #2 saying I didn't get the job. WTF. He says he has no idea why, since I had such a great interview.

TL;DR: Recruiter #1 asks about my job situation, I tell him I might have an offer. He asks which position and company. Recruiter #2 calls me back saying I didn't get the job.

What do I do? Did recruiter #1 screw me over?

---

**Comments:**

* "Recruiter #1 is a total sleazeball. He's trying to get the job for himself or his client. Don't bother responding to him again."
* "I'd be furious if I were you. You need to report recruiter #1 to the agency and the state licensing board. He's clearly violating your trust."
* "I think recruiter #1 was just trying to get more information to help you, but he didn't do it in a professional way. Maybe give him another chance to apologize and make it right?"
* "Recruiter #2 is probably just as guilty. They're both trying to make a buck off of you. Don't trust either of them."
* "Have you considered just going direct to the company and asking about the status of your application? You don't need recruiters anymore."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys. I'm still trying to process what happened. I think I'll just go direct to the company and ask about the status of my application. I don't need recruiters anymore. And yeah, I'm definitely reporting recruiter #1 to the agency and the state licensing board. Thanks for the support!"

TITLE: I [18M] see/ remember only the good parts of our 3 year relationship while she [18F] sees and remembers only the bad parts

POST: My gf and I dated happily throughout high school and we're now doing long distance in college. We've been having some issues because she feels like I haven't done her much good.

While I look back on our years together and see love, happiness, hand holding, kissing, and everything nice she sees lies, fights, separation, and everything bad.

How can I help her see my point of view? Bringing up good memories and feelings can only make her happy for a night. Most of the bad things about our relationship is stemmed from her not being able to let anything bad that's ever happened with us go. She just feels sad with me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been having issues because she feels like I haven't done her much good. I see only the good parts of our relationship while she sees only the bad. How can I help her see my point of view?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "It sounds like you're both stuck in your own narratives about your relationship. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation about what you both remember and how it's affecting you? Maybe you can work together to find a way to move forward and focus on the present."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "It's not uncommon for people to have different perspectives on their relationship. However, it's important to recognize that your girlfriend's feelings and experiences are valid too. Instead of trying to change her perspective, maybe you can try to understand where she's coming from and validate her emotions. Ask her what specifically is bothering her and listen to her response."
3. **u/longdistanceproblems**: "Long distance can be tough, and it's no wonder you're having issues. Have you considered scheduling regular video calls or visits to help you stay connected and work through your issues together? It might also be helpful to set some boundaries and communicate openly about what you both need from each other."
4. **u/communicationiskey**: "Communication is key in any relationship. Make sure you're both taking the time to listen to each other and express your feelings openly. It's also important to avoid blaming or accusing each other, as this can escalate conflicts. Try to use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements, and focus on your own feelings and experiences."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your relationship and work through your issues. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it's okay to have different perspectives. Instead of trying to change each other, maybe you can focus on growing together and finding common ground. Good luck!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I was just trying to force my perspective on her instead of really listening to her. I'll try to have a more open and honest conversation with her about what's bothering her and validate her emotions. And yeah, we should definitely schedule more regular video calls and visits to help us stay connected. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: [Oklahoma] Contract Dispute

POST: I'll try to keep it short for you all. This is in Oklahoma.

Before we started building we agreed upon the terms and signed two contracts. We signed a Construction Agreement and Specification Agreement. The first one lines out the overall terms of the contract, the second one lines out the specifications that the home is to be built to (construction materials, quality, etc). Both of these documents have a total sales price listed on them, however the price is different on each one. The Construction Agreement has the price listed at $200K, which is $6K higher than the price that is listed on the Spec Agreement.

The main dispute we are having is over a septic system. When we entered into the agreement we agreed that I was going to install the septic myself and save us $6K. However after construction started we had a hiccup with our guy and we ended up letting the builder install it for us.

On the Spec Agreement (the one with the lower price) he actually has in there that one of the things he agrees to is to install a septic tank, even though when the contract was signed he wasn't going to do that. This Spec Agreement says the sales price of the home with him installing septic is $194K.

When I saw the discrepancy in prices I thought he'd just forgotten to take the $6K off of one contract, but not the other. When I talked to him about it he said it was a typo and the price on the Master Agreement (the higher price) is the correct price and the price on the Spec Agreement is a typo, plain and simple.
What he is trying to do now is to charge us the higher price ($200K) plus an extra $6K for installing the septic. I'm not trying to get anything for free here, I'm just wanting to be fair.

TL;DR: We signed two contracts with different prices listed. One has a lower price because we agreed to install septic ourselves, but we ended up having the builder install it. The builder is now trying to charge us the higher price plus an extra $6K for installing the septic.

QUESTION: What are my rights in this situation? Should I try to negotiate with the builder or is it time to seek legal action? I've already tried talking to him and he's not budging.

ADVICE: The first thing to do is to review the contracts and see if there are any ambiguities or inconsistencies that can be used to your advantage. It's also important to keep in mind that the builder may be trying to take advantage of you, but it's also possible that there was a genuine mistake made.

In terms of negotiating, it's worth trying to have a calm and professional conversation with the builder to see if you can come to a mutually agreeable solution. However, if the builder is unwilling to budge, it may be time to seek legal action.

It's also important to keep in mind that Oklahoma has laws and regulations that govern construction contracts, and you may want to consult with an attorney who is familiar with these laws to get a better understanding of your rights and options.

Overall, it's important to stay calm and professional, and to document everything that happens in this situation. Good luck!

TITLE: Need help to get away from bully bosses

POST: Im in my early 20s and I make loudspeakers and amplifiers for a living. I have worked here for around a year, learning how to do the job from scratch with no experience. My two bosses are awful people who shout, swear and pretty much make my life hell. It is a very skilled job but I am paid minimum wage, less than people who work in supermarkets etc! I was told after 6 months I would be given a pay rise but this did not happen. I decided not to bring it up and just try and get a new job. I have been trying for months now but to no avail.

On the 4th of august I broke my ankle, meaning i literally cannot work as I am required to stand for 9 hours a day. My boss has rang me numerous times basically bribing me into coming into work, telling me how I am not playing ball and basically not committed to the company. This spurred me on to apply for jobs, and I have an interview for an admin job tomorrow. Can anyone give me some advice? 

Sorry about the wall of text....

TL;DR: Need help getting away from bully bosses and finding a new job.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely unacceptable that your bosses are treating you this way. I would suggest reaching out to a labor lawyer or a local employment agency to see if they can help you with your situation. In the meantime, I would focus on preparing for your admin job interview and try to stay positive. You deserve better than to be treated like this."
2. **u/jobsrock**: "OP, I feel your pain. I went through a similar situation a few years ago and it was a nightmare. My advice would be to not give up on your current job just yet. Try to document everything that's happening, including dates, times, and details of what's happening. This can be helpful if you need to take legal action. Also, make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and mentally during this time. You got this!"
3. **u/anonymous123**: "OP, I'm a former employee of the same company and I can confirm that the bosses are indeed bullies. I would suggest looking into other job opportunities as soon as possible. Don't worry about the admin job, it's just a stepping stone. You deserve a job where you're respected and valued. Keep your head up and don't let them get to you."
4. **u/careercoach**: "OP, I'm a career coach and I would suggest taking a step back and looking at your overall career goals. What do you want to achieve in your career? What are your strengths and weaknesses? What kind of work environment do you thrive in? Once you have a clear idea of what you want, you can start looking for jobs that align with your goals. Don't settle for a job that makes you unhappy or undervalued. You deserve better."
5. **u/employmentlawyer**: "OP, I'm an employment lawyer and I would suggest reaching out to me directly to discuss your situation. I can help you understand your rights and options for dealing with your bosses. Don't hesitate to reach out, I'm here to help."

TITLE: Me (19F) hung up on (20M)...still

POST: I'll try to keep this short and sweet. In the last few weeks of term at college I met this guy. We were basically unstoppable together. Spent every waking hour together, went on adventures, were a big bundle of energy, so alike in every way, amazing amazing sex. 

Problem was, he's a pro skier and is gone for 3/4s of the year training nonstop. We didn't talk about things before we left, but kept talking on the phone, texting for a while. 

Then we decided that we had to break things off. It would be almost a year before we would be in the same place again. Skiing is incredibly emotionally consuming. It was fine. I understood, it was for the best.

But it has been a month since we decided to break it off. It doesn't feel like I'm getting over him. Sure, I have a few moments here or there that are temporarily alright, but they are just tiny distractions from the fact that I miss him. We've barely talked in the past weeks. I'm so afraid that I will never find anyone that gives me such energy, that fits with me so wonderfully. I don't even know if I want to get over him. I don't know if he wants to get over me.

TL;DR: Hung up on my boyfriend of a few weeks because we knew we wouldn't be together for a year due to his ski training. We broke up, but I'm still struggling to get over him. We barely talk now, and I'm worried I'll never find someone like him again.

**Comments:**

* "It's normal to take time to process and grieve the loss of a relationship, especially one that was so intense and all-consuming. Give yourself permission to feel your emotions and don't rush the healing process."
* "It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and not trying to rush the process. Remember that you're not defined by this relationship and that you have so much to offer. Keep being your amazing self and the right person will come along when the time is right."
* "I think it's interesting that you mention not knowing if you want to get over him. Sometimes we need to go through the process of grieving and healing before we can truly move on. It's okay to take your time and figure out what you want for yourself."
* "It's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. You don't have to rush into anything or try to fill the void with someone else. Just be kind to yourself and keep moving forward."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and not trying to suppress them. Remember that you're strong and capable, and that you will get through this. Keep being your amazing self and the right person will come along when the time is right."



**Reddit's Relationship Advice:**

* Be patient and don't rush the healing process.

* Acknowledge your feelings and don't try to suppress them.
* Remember that you're strong and capable, and that you will get through this.
* Keep being your amazing self and the right person will come along when the time is right.

TITLE: Moving From One Coast To Another - fml :(

POST: Wasn't really sure where to ask, but r/travel made the most sense from what I could find.. anyways..

I'm moving from NYC to either Seattle or San Francisco in June, and am scratching my head as how the hell to actually do it. Right now I'm planning on road-tripping it with a couple friends (one who's flying over for the trip, another moving from ATL who may be using a U-Haul). I don't have a lot of things to move- mostly boxes of things I plan on shipping, and then a bit more (valuables, etc.) that I'd just take along for the ride. Basically, I want to travel light, but will take the things more fragile and whatnot.

I guess I'm looking for insight on the following:

-Rental companies (for cars)

-Does it make sense to even rent a car for that distance (buy used??)

-Ways to save a buck in lodging (I love camping!)

-Shipping companies; items (clothes- ship most of them, or take?)

I don't know. This is such a new thing for me. I guess if any one has attempted and completed this crazy thing that is moving across the country, any insight would be of help.

TL;DR: Moving from NYC to either Seattle or San Francisco in June, planning on road-tripping with friends. Need advice on rental companies, car options, lodging, and shipping companies.

TITLE: Accidental non-petty revenge.

POST: This is the story of how my plan for a petty revenge accidentally got my victim arrested.

So I met an old bully at a night club a year or two ago, and he came up to me and tried to be all pally, despite the fact that he made a few years of my life hell. I told him to fuck off, and went on with my partying, but his mere presence ruined my night, so I planned some petty revenge.

I knew the owner of the club, and some of the guards, so I told a guard that I thought he might be dealing drugs in the bathrooms to get him thrown out. Little did I know that he was selling drugs in the bathrooms, and things get a bit out of hand.

The guards check it out, and realize that he is selling drugs, so they try to stop him. He punches one guard and locks himself in one of the stalls (and even though he is in the bathroom he does not think of flushing the drugs).

The police comes and while arresting him, he breaks one of their noses. He was charged and convicted of aggravated assault, assaulting a public official, resisting arrest, selling cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and weed.

TL;DR: I tried to get revenge on an old bully by getting him thrown out of a club for dealing drugs, but it ended up getting him arrested and charged with multiple felonies.

---

This post is a great example of how a plan for petty revenge can backfire and have unintended consequences. The OP's intention was to get the bully thrown out of the club, but instead, they ended up getting him arrested and charged with multiple felonies.

The post also highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of one's actions, especially when it comes to revenge. The OP's actions may have seemed petty and harmless at the time, but they ended up having serious and far-reaching consequences for the bully.

The post has received a lot of attention and comments on the subreddit, with many users praising the OP for their cleverness and others expressing concern for the bully's well-being. The post has also sparked a lot of discussion about the ethics of revenge and the potential consequences of one's actions.

TITLE: Me [23M] been on a path of self-improvement but struggling with the opposite sex

POST: I've never been a big time ladies man or anything but I've generally had a decent love life, my fair share of relationships, girls having crushes on me, etc. A year and a half ago I had a bad breakup and realized I didn't like who I had become. I was out of shape, emotionally unstable and generally unhappy.

So with this introspection I set on a path of self improvement. I work out daily now, did some therapy, graduated uni and got a great new job and even improved my wardrobe. I've made new friends and reconnected with old ones (male and female), and I've been on more fun adventures in the past year than I probably had been my whole life.

Yet somehow with all that, I feel like I'm become less attractive to women. I haven't done anything sexual with a woman since my breakup a year and half ago (hooked up with my ex a couple times post breakup but that's it). For a long time I didn't let it bother me as I was focusing on myself and making myself a whole happy person, but now that I'm finally 100% where I want to be, it's starting to erode my confidence and almost hurt my progress. I'm the type of guy who's been to bothered by my lack of height (5'7) but now I'm suddenly really self conscious about it since it's the only thing I CANT change about myself. Is it just that in this tinder-age sex revolution some of us are just bound to left behind? Am I self-sabotaging myself somehow? Is there some part of my self-improvement that I'm missing?

TL;DR: I've been on a path of self-improvement for a year and a half, but despite feeling more confident and happy, I'm struggling to attract women. I'm starting to feel like I'm just not meant to be with someone. Help?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 5'7" and you're worried about your height? You're a catch! Women care about so much more than physical appearance. Focus on being the best version of yourself and the right person will come along."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're focusing on external validation (attracting women) instead of internal validation (being happy with yourself). You're already a great person, don't change who you are to fit someone else's expectations."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not about the physical appearance. It's about the confidence and charisma you exude. You're focusing on the wrong things. Instead of trying to attract women, focus on being the best version of yourself and the right person will come along."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not 'left behind' just because you're not getting attention from women. You're a unique snowflake and there's someone out there who will appreciate you for who you are."
* "I think you're missing the point of self-improvement. It's not about changing who you are to fit someone else's expectations, it's about becoming the best version of yourself. You're already doing that, so stop worrying about what others think and focus on your own happiness."
* "I'm a woman and I can tell you that it's not about the physical appearance. It's about the emotional connection and the effort you put into the relationship. You're focusing on the wrong things.

TITLE: Work advice

POST: Me 26 F, My 2 co-workers 45 F.  I've been at my job for 3 months and management is very impressed with my work.  So impressed, that they've put me in charge of one woman and they want me to learn another woman's job.  These two women have been at the company for 3 years and it's quite obvious that they hate me.  They've yelled at me, told co-workers that I don't know what I'm doing and are insulting me in Armenian.  I'm trying to be as nice as possible about the whole situation.  It's understandable why they are upset, but I'm having a hard time not taking it personally.  Advice, please?

TL;DR: New to job, 2 coworkers hate me, management wants me to learn their jobs, how do I handle the situation?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, you're doing everything right by being nice and professional. Don't take their behavior personally, it's not about you, it's about their own insecurities. Try to focus on building a positive relationship with them, even if it's just a small step at a time. Remember, you're not responsible for their emotions, only your own."
2. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I would suggest having a meeting with management and expressing your concerns. Let them know that you're willing to learn and take on new responsibilities, but you need their support and guidance to do so. Also, ask them to address the behavior of your coworkers, as it's affecting your work environment."
3. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, you're doing great! Don't let their negativity bring you down. Focus on your strengths and the reasons why management is impressed with your work. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who believe in you and your abilities."
4. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I would try to find common ground with your coworkers. Ask them about their interests or hobbies outside of work, and try to find something you have in common. This can help break the ice and build a positive relationship."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, you're in a tough spot, but you're handling it like a pro. Remember that you're not responsible for their behavior, only your own. Keep being professional, and don't let their negativity affect your work or your self-esteem."

TITLE: I [18M] kissed my girlfriend's [17F] close friend while we were on a break. I confessed this to her and she doesn't trust me anymore.

POST: I was on a break with my girlfriend after some difficulties and I kissed one of her close friends. Although I thought I would not be getting back with my girlfriend, I regretted it immediately. Sometime afterwards I got back together with my girlfriend and I told her last night what had happened as I couldn't deal with the guilt. She started crying and said she has lost all trust in me. I feel sick. Just to be clear, she was seeing other people on the break too. I guess since it's one of her close friends I crossed a boundary. What is my next move? I hope you can help!

TL;DR: I kissed my girlfriend's close friend while we were on a break, confessed to her, and now she doesn't trust me anymore. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway12345**: "You're lucky she's still talking to you. You need to take responsibility for your actions and work on rebuilding her trust. Start by being honest and transparent about your feelings and actions. Don't expect her to forgive you overnight, but be willing to put in the effort to regain her trust."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "It's not just about the kiss, it's about the fact that you kept it from her for so long. You need to have an open and honest conversation with her about why you didn't tell her sooner. Be prepared to listen to her feelings and concerns, and be willing to work through this together."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure why you're surprised that she doesn't trust you anymore. You cheated on her, even if it was just a kiss. You need to take a hard look at yourself and figure out why you felt the need to do something so hurtful. Then, you need to make amends and work on rebuilding your relationship."
4. **u/just_a_observer**: "It's not just about you, it's about your girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. You need to respect her boundaries and give her the space she needs. Don't try to rush things or pressure her into forgiving you. Let her come to you when she's ready to talk."
5. **u/relationship_coach**: "It's great that you confessed to your girlfriend, but now you need to take it a step further. You need to work on rebuilding your relationship and earning back her trust. This will take time, effort, and commitment from both of you. Don't give up, but also don't expect things to go back to normal overnight."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly in favor of the OP taking responsibility for his actions and working to rebuild his girlfriend's trust. Many commenters emphasize the importance of honesty, transparency, and open communication in the relationship. Some commenters also suggest that the OP needs to take a hard look at himself and figure out why he felt the need to cheat on his girlfriend. Overall, the community is urging the OP to take a long-term approach to rebuilding his relationship and earning back his girlfriend's trust.

TITLE: The worst person is in my math class. What do I do?!

POST: This semester, I'm in a higher level math class, which is a pretty OK course. It's a class of maybe 30 students. I (and quite a few of the other folks in my class) have found it increasingly difficult to concentrate, however, due to one individual. This guy is a non-traditional student. He sits in the front of the room every day, but there's always a small ring of empty seats around him because he has serious personal hygiene issues. B.O. combined with the smell of a pack's worth of cigarette smoke emanates from his body.

To make matters worse, it seems that he has some sort of autism. He'll rock back and forth in his seat during class which is both visually (he sits in the front) and audibly distracting (the seats creak).

The cherry on the cake, however, is that for long stretches of class he will breathe exclusively through his mouth. I have no idea whether this is a health-related issue or a psychological thing, but his breathing is loud enough to make it hard to hear the (albeit soft-spoken) professor.

What do I do, Reddit? These seem like issues that shouldn't really exist, but can anything be done?

TL;DR: Worst person in my math class has B.O., smokes, rocks in seat, and has loud mouth breathing. What do I do?!

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Dude, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'd suggest talking to your professor about it. They might be able to help you find a solution or at least make accommodations for you. If that doesn't work, you could try talking to a student counselor or someone in the disability services department. They might be able to help you figure out how to deal with the distractions."
2. **u/autisticperson**: "As an autistic person, I can tell you that rocking back and forth in a seat is a common coping mechanism for some of us. It can help us feel more comfortable and focused. I'm not saying that it's okay for someone to have B.O. or smoke in class, but I do think it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Maybe try talking to the person and explaining how their behavior is affecting you, rather than just complaining about it."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I'm not sure what to say, but I do think it's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and challenges. Maybe this person is dealing with some kind of health issue or personal crisis that's causing them to behave in a way that's distracting to others. Instead of focusing on how annoying they are, maybe try to find ways to be more understanding and compassionate. Who knows, you might even find that it makes you a better person."

TITLE: Is it insensitive for me (17f) to break up with my boyfriend (20m) because he's moving away to help his mother?

POST: I'm copying this from /r/relationship_advice

My boyfriends home state is Michigan and he recently (in October) moved here, to NC. We met soon after he moved and we started dating on Thanksgiving night. Last week his mom got into a car accident (minor injuries to her) and is getting sick (I don't know what with). She has to either fix her car or buy a new one, and she's already late on rent. So my bf is moving back home to help her out.

He told me he wants to get her in a better financial situation, and get himself into a better one too. I understand it fully, and I don't blame him one bit. I just don't want to be in another (I've been in two!) long distance relationship. I can't handle them well. And I know we won't be able to see each other much, and I just feel like its a bad idea. But at the same time I feel a bit selfish and insensitive. Am i?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is moving back to Michigan to help his mom, and I don't want to be in another long distance relationship. I feel selfish and insensitive for considering breaking up with him.

COMMENT 1:
OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's not selfish or insensitive to prioritize your own needs and feelings in a relationship. You've been in two long distance relationships already, and it's understandable that you don't want to go through that again. It's not like your boyfriend is leaving you for someone else or abandoning you - he's doing this out of a sense of responsibility and obligation to his mom. You should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.

COMMENT 2:
I think you're being way too focused on your own feelings and not considering your boyfriend's perspective. He's not just moving away for himself, he's doing it to help his mom in a time of need. You should be supporting him and being understanding, not breaking up with him because it's inconvenient for you. If you really care about him, you'll find a way to make it work, even if it's hard.

COMMENT 3:
I think you're being way too dramatic. It's just a long distance relationship, it's not the end of the world. You can still communicate with each other and make it work. And who knows, maybe this is an opportunity for you to grow and learn to be more patient and understanding. Don't be so quick to break up over something that's not a deal-breaker.

COMMENT 4:
I think you're being way too selfish. You're not considering the bigger picture here. Your boyfriend is doing this out of a sense of responsibility and obligation to his mom, and you're just thinking about how it affects you. You should be supporting him and being understanding, not breaking up with him because it's inconvenient for you. If you really care about him, you'll find a way to make it work, even if it's hard.

COMMENT 5:
I think you're being way too sensitive. It's just a move, it's not a big deal. You can still have a relationship even if you're not in the same state. And who knows, maybe this is an opportunity for you to learn to be more independent and self-sufficient. Don't be so quick to break up over something that's not a deal-breaker.

The comments on this post are a mix of opinions, with some people agreeing with the OP that it's okay to prioritize their own needs and feelings, while others think the OP is being selfish and insensitive for considering breaking up with their boyfriend. Some comments suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with their boyfriend about their feelings and try to find a compromise, while others think the OP should be more understanding and supportive of their boyfriend's decision to move away. Overall, the comments reflect the complexity and diversity of opinions on the topic of long distance relationships and the challenges of balancing personal needs and feelings with the needs and feelings of others.

TITLE: Today, I realized why I am so calm and collected during times of chaos and disagreement. My body turns anger into sadness, reducing me into a sobing mess every time I get angry. What horrible decisions does your mind make for you that you can't control?

POST: From what I can remember, my childhood environment was filled with distrust, yelling, judging, anger, confrontation and control, 

any attempt at voicing my opinions or becoming angry was useless and ended up worse then it needed to.

Since then any sign of anger was channeled away and eventually filled with sadness and severe depression. I'm not an angry person, nor do i concern myself with things that stress me out, my life is vary vary stress free.

Recently after I looked back on what brought me here and why my body reacts the way I do its pretty clear. Any immediate bout of anger instantly turns to sadness and tears involuntarily.

TL;DR: I'm a master of suppressing anger, but it turns into sadness and depression instead. What other weird mental tricks does your mind play on you?

**Comments:**

2. **u/throwaway789**: "I have a similar experience. Whenever I get angry, I start to feel a sense of detachment from my body. It's like I'm observing myself from outside, and it's really unsettling. I've learned to recognize the signs and take a step back to process my emotions."

4. **u/throwaway456**: "I have a tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts and emotions. It's like my mind is stuck in a loop, replaying the same thoughts over and over again. I've learned to recognize the signs and challenge those thoughts by reframing them in a more positive light."
5. **u/throwaway901**: "I'm a perfectionist, and I often find myself getting overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect. It's like my mind is constantly judging me, and it's really hard to shake off the feeling of inadequacy. I'm working on practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes."
6. **u/throwaway111**: "I have a tendency to people-please, and I often find myself sacrificing my own needs and desires to avoid conflict or rejection. It's exhausting, and I'm working on setting boundaries and prioritizing my own well-being."

8. **u/throwaway333**: "I have a tendency to catastrophize, and I often find myself getting overwhelmed by worst-case scenarios.

TITLE: 23M- girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. Thinking of getting an escort- good/bad idea?

POST: For the first couple weeks I was so depressed I could only sleep 1-4 hrs a day and couldn't stop overthinking things. Now for the past couple days I've been sleeping okay and have started thinking forwards. I still miss her, am a bit sad, and have dreams of her almost every day. Though the majority of the day now I'm fine.

I've also been really horny lately as I haven't done it for a month now. Am thinking of getting an escort. I was looking to get into a one nighter or hookup for the past week but have had no luck. No matches on Tinder really brought down my self-esteem too though I think I'm above average looking. Feeling stressed out, should I get an escort for a night or will it be a huge mistake?

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years, feeling horny and considering getting an escort for a night. Good or bad idea?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, I'm sorry to hear about your breakup. But getting an escort is not the answer. You're still grieving and it's not healthy to use someone else for your own emotional release. Take some time to focus on yourself, your feelings, and your well-being. You deserve better than a one-night stand."
* "I get it, you're horny and you want to get laid. But think about the potential consequences. You could get an STI, or worse, get attached to someone who's just using you for the same reason you're using them. And what about your ex? You're still grieving and you're going to go out and get with someone else? That's not going to help you move on."
* "I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but you gotta be realistic. You're still in love with your ex, and getting with someone else is just going to make things worse. You need to focus on yourself and figure out why you're still so hung up on her. Maybe take some time to reflect on the relationship and what you could've done differently. And if you're still feeling horny, maybe try some solo stuff or talk to a friend about it."
* "I've been in your shoes before, and trust me, getting an escort is not the answer. It's just going to make you feel worse in the long run. You need to focus on yourself and your own healing. Take some time to grieve, and then when you're ready, start focusing on yourself and what you want out of life. You're better than that, bro."

Overall, the comments are cautioning the OP against getting an escort, citing potential negative consequences such as STIs, emotional attachment, and further complicating the healing process. They are encouraging him to focus on himself, his feelings, and his well-being, and to take time to reflect on the relationship and his own emotions before making any rash decisions. The comments are coming from a place of concern and empathy, with the goal of helping the OP make a healthier and more positive choice.

TITLE: 11 years since my heart transplant, and i'm tired of medication's side effects

POST: When I had my heart transplant i was 12. I remember I was always tired and i can't breath properly so my mother took me to the ospital. We found out that my heart was larger than normal, they put me on transplant list and 3 weeks later there was an heart available for me.
Now I'm 23 and I almost spent the majority of my life with a new heart. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes i feel like it's an heavy bag on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel guilty, because when i was sick i prayed for a new heart (and it means that i prayed that a child would die to take me alive).
Sometimes I just feel "normal" and then reality comes back and hit me in my face with a new complication (my medication take me alive but they have a lot of side effects)
I don't plan my life, I just live it day by day, knowing that one of this days my doctors can tell me some bad news.
If i must describe what i feel, it will be a mix of angriness, resignation and a little bit of fear, knowing that life took my innocence away when i was a kid.
Sorry for my bad english but I'm italian

TL;DR: 11 years since my heart transplant, and I'm tired of medication's side effects. I feel guilty, angry, and scared, living with the constant fear of complications and bad news.

TITLE: I'm a 30-year-old woman and I'm still living with my parents

POST: I'm 30 years old and I'm still living with my parents. I know it's not normal, but I just can't seem to get my life together. I've been working part-time jobs for years, but I've never been able to save up enough money to move out. My parents are nice and they don't mind me staying, but I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

I've tried to make plans to move out, but something always seems to come up. Either I'll get a new job that's not stable, or I'll have to take care of a family member who's sick. It's like I'm just stuck in this never-ending cycle of uncertainty.

I feel like I'm the only one who's still living with their parents at my age. All my friends have moved out and started their own families. I feel like I'm failing at adulthood.

I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not independent enough. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not a real adult.

I just wish I could get my life together and move out already. I wish I could be like everyone else and have a normal life.

TL;DR: I'm a 30-year-old woman living with my parents and feeling stuck. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough and not independent enough. I just want to move out and have a normal life.

POST: I'm 25 years old and I'm still a virgin. I know it's not a big deal, but it's something that I've been struggling with for a long time. I've been on a few dates and I've had some close calls, but nothing has ever worked out.

I've tried to talk to my friends about it, but they just tell me to "get out there" and "stop being a prude." They don't understand that it's not that easy for me. I've been hurt before and I'm scared of getting hurt again.

I feel like I'm the only one who's still a virgin at my age. All my friends have moved on and started their own families. I feel like I'm stuck in the past.

I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not worthy of love. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not a real man.

I just wish I could find someone who understands me and accepts me for who I am. I wish I could find someone who doesn't care about my past and just wants to be with me.

TL;DR: I'm a 25-year-old man and I'm still a virgin. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough and not worthy of love. I just want to find someone who understands me and accepts me for who I am.

TITLE: [28/f] How do I become relationship-type and more feminine?

POST: I don't think I'm relationship-type.  I'm also insecure about my level of femininity.  
Men that I meet (work/socially) are hardly ever single.  The ones who are and that I get to know, I almost always develop a crush, but try so hard to hide it that they just end up becoming a good friend of mine.  They usually make it clear that they are attracted to me, but I disregard it.  I make it so easy to be comfortable with, the start sharing secrets and life stories and I do the same.  And that's where I know I screw up.  I also think I am headstrong, brazen and outspoken.  I'm very opinionated.  Also, I'm not as feminine (clothing) as other women.  I wear makeup, do cute hairstyles, wear lipstick, do my nails, wear jewelry, I have a perfume collection, etc.  But I do not wear skirts, dresses, or heels and open-toed shoes.  I think it is all beautiful, but I feel so alien like with it on.   I'm not a tomboy, I just don't like super girly attire.  I've had a male friend tell me that he and a lot of other men would date me if I was more feminine and submissive.  
Also, I've dated a couple of guys in the past who refuse to get serious with me.  They don't take me seriously romantically.  It seems like they'll try to hook up (9/10 times I'm not putting out) but not make anything exclusive.  I'm starting to feel real insecure.  Am I crazy and just don't know it?  Do men really only date super feminine women?  Am I too friendly?  How can I become more comfortable?  What do men like?  I'm at a age where I want to be in a relationship and fall in love, but I'm not sure if someone will ever accept me for me.  Sorry for the pity party.  I've been single for so long, I have to accept it is my fault.

TL;DR: I'm a 28-year-old woman who feels like I'm not relationship-type and insecure about my femininity.  I'm headstrong, outspoken, and don't wear traditional feminine clothing.  I've had trouble getting serious with guys in the past and feel like I'm not being taken seriously romantically.  I'm looking for advice on how to become more comfortable and attractive to men.

RESPONSES:

1. **You're not alone**: You're not crazy, and it's not your fault. Many women struggle with feeling like they're not "relationship-type" or feminine enough. It's okay to be yourself, and it's not about changing who you are to fit someone else's expectations. You're already doing many things that are attractive to men, like being confident and outspoken. Don't give up on yourself!
2. **Focus on what you have to offer**: Instead of trying to change who you are, focus on what you have to offer as a partner. You're intelligent, confident, and have a great sense of humor. These are all attractive qualities! Don't worry about what others think; focus on being the best version of yourself.
3. **Embrace your individuality**: You don't have to wear traditional feminine clothing to be feminine. Embrace your individuality and express yourself in ways that feel authentic to you. You're already doing many things that are feminine, like wearing makeup and doing your nails. Don't feel like you need to conform to societal expectations of what it means to be feminine.
4. **Don't settle for someone who doesn't take you seriously**: You deserve someone who respects and values you for who you are. Don't settle for someone who doesn't take you seriously romantically. You're worth more than that!
5. **Practice self-care**: Take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to attract someone who loves and respects you for who you are.

TITLE: TIFU by visiting an ex

POST: This is a throwaway.

I dated a girl from January to August of last year.  We were pretty intimate, and had sex regularly that often ended with me finishing inside her. (It was mutually enjoyed, as she was on contraceptives.)  We had a pretty nasty breakup, and we didn't talk for awhile. 

In May of this year, she sent me a random text apologizing for things she said.  Feeling pretty frisky (and I suppose somewhat lonely), I offered to meet up and catch up with her.  I had no intention of rekindling our relationship, but hey, possible sex.  So we met at a bar, and I ended up going to her house.  We had sex in our normal fashion and proceeded to stay over for the night.  The next morning, we discussed our situation, and I confessed I didn't want to advance our relationship.  She somewhat reluctantly agreed.

I've been seeing a new girl for about a month now, and things are amazing!  We click on every level, she's gorgeous, and I find myself thinking about her constantly.  I don't think I've ever been so intrigued by somebody after such a short amount of time. I think I've found the perfect girl.  Except...

Today my ex called me.  She's pregnant.  She had secretly been off birth control for awhile, and she admitted that she thought a kid would be a way to "keep us from fighting" and to "make us close again."

Yep.  I think I fucked up.  I don't know what to do, or how this girl I'm seeing will take it.

TL;DR: I had sex with my ex, who's now pregnant, and I'm seeing someone new.  I don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "You're a real piece of work, aren't you? You're already in a new relationship and you're still messing around with your ex. You need to take responsibility for your actions and figure out what you want before you hurt anyone else."
* "I'm not saying it's right, but I can understand why you might not want to rekindle the relationship. However, you should have been honest with your new girlfriend about the situation before things got serious. Now you're in a tough spot."
* "You're a TIFU masterclass. You're not only a cheater, but you're also a liar and a manipulator. You need to own up to your mistakes and make things right with your new girlfriend and your ex."
* "I'm not sure what's more surprising, the fact that you had sex with your ex or the fact that she's pregnant. Either way, you need to take responsibility for your actions and figure out what you want to do. You can't keep stringing people along and expecting them to be okay with it."
* "You're a real jerk. You're not even sorry for what you did. You're just worried about how it's going to affect your new girlfriend. You need to take a hard look at yourself and figure out why you're doing this. Is it because you're lonely? Is it because you're bored? Whatever the reason, you need to stop and think about how your actions are affecting others."

TITLE: Me [29 M] with my GF [25 F] She broke up with me, I found out she was cheating. Should I confront her?

POST: OK so first the background details. We've been together 4 years and live together. I truly love her and had planned on proposing to her later this year. 2 weeks ago she broke up with me over a silly fight. Said she need time to herself blah blah blah. I was devastated as I didn't see it coming. The weird part is she currently has been living with me after the breakup and will be here until next week which is when she will move out.

Now for the juicy part. Today i opened her laptop and she was signed into her email. I found numerous chat logs of her and a male co worker talking sexually and she even had sent him a nude photo. These texts go back to November. Normally i don't like to snoop around so I feel super guilty, but I had been having suspicions all along. I remember about 3 months back her entire attitude had changed and she became more distant which is around the time she had also mentioned that there was a guy in her office who liked her. This is the guys shes been chatting with.

Now, even though we are broken up I don't know what to do. Should I tell her I know? Even though it means exposing myself as having gone through her email? Should I just let it go? I feel like shit because this coworker of hers is married and basically I think instigated this whole ordeal for her to break up with me? Either way I'm at a loss.

TL;DR: GF broke up with me 2 weeks ago, I found out she's been cheating on me with a coworker, should I confront her?

COMMENT 1:
Dude, you gotta tell her. You can't just let her get away with this. Even though you're broken up, you deserve the truth and she needs to know that you know. It's not about exposing yourself for snooping, it's about being honest and standing up for yourself. Just be prepared for the possibility that she might deny it or try to spin it, but you gotta be firm and assertive. Good luck, bro.

COMMENT 2:
I agree with the above comment. You need to tell her. But also, you need to take care of yourself during this process. This is a lot to take in and you're going to need some support. Consider talking to a friend or a therapist about what you're going through. And remember, you don't deserve to be cheated on, regardless of the circumstances of your breakup.

COMMENT 3:
I think you should take a step back and think about why you're so invested in confronting her. Are you doing it to prove a point or to get closure? If it's the latter, then maybe it's not worth it. You've already been hurt once, and confronting her could lead to more drama and hurt. Maybe it's better to just focus on moving on and taking care of yourself. Just something to consider.

COMMENT 4:
I think you should tell her, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not care or might even deny it. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and not put yourself in a situation where you're going to get hurt again. Maybe it's better to just focus on yourself and move on. You deserve better than someone who would cheat on you.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21/F] is having a mental breakdown, how can I [21/M] help her?

POST: My girlfriend is going through a rough patch in her life right now. She is a university student doing an extremely hard subject. She has a lot of pressure on herself right now due to fear of letting her parents down.

Two weeks ago she started having obsessional thoughts about death and not existing. This prospect scared her to the point of having several panic attacks every day. She isn't religious and does not believe in an afterlife. Going to church seemed to help at first, but she is simply too inquisitive and scientific-minded to genuinely believe in an afterlife.

Now the panic attacks seem to have subsided but she is still having these thoughts. It usually manifests itself as an hour long period of not being able to function and then suddenly gathering up the energy to study for hours. She doesn't feel comfortable talking to her parents about this anymore because they tell her she is crazy. She has told me herself that the feeling is so unbearable she wishes that she just didn't exist sometimes.

I am encouraging her to get as much physical activity as possible and showing my support, but I feel clueless what else I can do to make her feel better? I try to avoid the subject of death now because nothing I say makes her feel any better; she counters anything I say with "so what's the point, we are all going to disappear in the end." When she isn't having these thoughts, she is fairly normal, but they happen often enough to affect her day-to-day functioning.

Going to the doctor isn't a realistic option right now for various reasons.

TL;DR: My girlfriend is having a mental breakdown due to fear of death and not existing. She is a university student with a lot of pressure on herself. She doesn't feel comfortable talking to her parents about it and I'm not sure what else I can do to help her.

TITLE: I [17m] feel like I lose connection with my girlfriend [17f] during the week, but it flares up on the weekends. Lack of PDA problem?

POST: My girlfriend and I were friends for a very long time and in the last two months have become a thing. I really really like her and as far as I can tell, she is really into me, but we have a problem. 

She haaaaates PDA which is kind of a problem because we spend a lot of time together during the week in classes and other activities. To be fair, I don't really like PDA either but she hates it with a passion and refuses to let it happen. Consequently, I feel like we drift apart during the week. But wait there's more! On the weekends we will get together 2 or 3 times at either her place or mine and good god do we get together. There's so much passion when we're together on the weekends (alone) but then come Monday morning (in public), everything shuts down. Do you have any advice on what I can do to remain intimate during the week without PDA?

TL;DR: Girlfriend hates PDA, we drift apart during the week, but get super intimate on weekends. How can I keep the spark alive during the week without PDA?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "I think the issue is that you're trying to force something that isn't natural for your girlfriend. Instead of trying to make her comfortable with PDA, maybe focus on other ways to show affection during the week. Like, surprise her with small gifts or write her sweet notes. It's not about the grand gestures, but the little things that show you care."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "I think you're misunderstanding what PDA is. PDA is not just about physical touch, it's about showing affection and intimacy in public. If your girlfriend is uncomfortable with physical touch, that's okay. But if she's also uncomfortable with showing affection in public, that's a different story. Maybe have an open and honest conversation with her about what makes her uncomfortable and see if you can find a compromise."
3. **u/sarcastic_sarah**: "Girl, you're 17 and you're already worried about PDA? Relax, you're young, you'll figure it out. Just be yourself and don't try to force anything. If it's meant to be, it'll happen naturally. And honestly, if she's really that uncomfortable with PDA, maybe she's not the right girl for you."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're focusing too much on the PDA aspect. Instead, try to focus on building a deeper connection with your girlfriend during the week. What are your shared interests? What do you both enjoy doing together? Focus on those things and the intimacy will follow naturally. And if it doesn't, maybe you're not compatible."

**OP's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I was focusing too much on the PDA aspect and not enough on building a deeper connection with my girlfriend. I'm going to try to focus on shared interests and activities during the week and see if that helps. And if it doesn't, maybe we're not compatible. Thanks again for the advice!" 

**Conclusion:**

The OP's post highlights the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. By acknowledging his girlfriend's discomfort with PDA and focusing on building a deeper connection, the OP is able to address the issue and potentially find a solution. The comments provide a range of perspectives, from focusing on small gestures to having an open conversation about what makes her uncomfortable. Ultimately, the OP's response shows that he is willing to listen and adapt, which is an important step in building a healthy and fulfilling relationship. 

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Communication is key: Having an open and honest conversation with your partner about what makes them uncomfortable can help address issues and find a solution.
2. Focus on shared interests: Building a deeper connection with your partner by focusing on shared interests and activities can help create intimacy and closeness.
3. Don't force it: If your partner is uncomfortable with PDA or other forms of physical affection, don't try to force it. Instead, focus on other ways to show affection and intimacy.
4. Be patient and understanding: Relationships take time and effort to build and maintain. Be patient and understanding with your partner, and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

TITLE: Me [34 M] with my coworker [29 F] working together for 3 years, How do I get back to being just friendly coworkers?

POST: edit typo: Me [24 M]

We've been working together for about 3 years and I just started to feel really attached to her in the last 4 months. I never told her and I did the best I could not to hint at anything because she is already in a relationship. I accepted that we will never be together and I'm starting to feel less shitty when I'm not around her. 

The problem is. We still go to lunch together and see each other about once or twice a week. 

Any tips on how to forget about romantic feelings for her?

TL;DR: I have feelings for my coworker, but she's in a relationship and I don't want to ruin our working relationship. How do I get back to being just friendly coworkers?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to maintain a professional relationship. It's not easy to do. Here's what I would suggest: take a step back and focus on your own life. Start doing things that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of work. This will help you shift your focus away from your coworker and onto your own happiness. Also, try to limit your interactions with her to work-related topics only. Avoid small talk or personal conversations that might keep the romantic feelings alive. Remember, it's okay to have feelings for someone, but it's not okay to act on them if they're in a relationship."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're being really responsible by not acting on your feelings. However, it's also important to acknowledge that you can't just 'forget' about your feelings overnight. It's going to take time and effort to move on. In the meantime, try to focus on building a stronger friendship with your coworker, but not a romantic one. You can still care about someone as a person without wanting to be in a romantic relationship with them. Also, consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend about your feelings. Sometimes just talking about it can help you process and move on."
3. **u/just_a_random_person**: "I think you're being really mature about this. It's not easy to admit when you have feelings for someone and then choose not to act on them. Here's what I would suggest: try to find ways to make your interactions with her more... routine. Like, instead of going to lunch together, try to grab lunch with other coworkers. Or, if you do go to lunch with her, try to make it more of a 'work discussion' rather than a'social' thing. Also, try to focus on your own goals and aspirations outside of work. This will help you feel more fulfilled and less focused on your coworker."
4. **u/awkward_situation**: "I'm in a similar situation with my coworker and I've found that it's really hard to just 'forget' about your feelings. But, I've also found that it's possible to maintain a professional relationship with someone you have feelings for. It's all about boundaries and communication. Try to set clear boundaries with your coworker about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. And, if you do find yourself getting too caught up in your feelings, try to communicate with your coworker about it. They might be feeling the same way and it could help to clear the air."

TITLE: Overly frustrated with soon to be in-laws, wedding planning in general

POST: Hi everyone,
I proposed to my girlfriend this past March and we have done zero planning for it so far. I always wanted a big wedding until I came out and then the reason people get married completely changed for me. Now I just see it as I want to spend the rest of my life with her, not go into a lot of debt (neither of our parents are helping pay for it) and be stressed out, just so we can wait for the day to be over to move on with our lives. We're also saving for a down payment for a house. We were thinking of going to the courthouse and then throwing a party for everyone but that's  not good enough for her parents. because then aunts and uncles may feel excluded because we can't bring a million people to the courthouse and she's the only daughter so her dad wants to walk her down the aisle. I have three sisters, so my dad has been there done that. We were then thinking of a destination wedding but it would be really expensive for her parents to pay for her brothers to come (three younger brothers, still in college/hs) and her parents tried guilting her about her brothers not being there. Really, if we could go and get married today and move on from it and do nothing for it we would. But it seems unless we do wedding/reception everyone's going to be mad. 

Sorry for the long rant, but does anyone have advise on what to do? Has anyone done/seen the "screw you we got married at the courthouse now moving on from this" move? How has it worked out?

TL;DR: Frustrated with soon-to-be in-laws and wedding planning in general. Want to keep it simple and move on with our lives, but they're pushing for a big wedding. Considering a courthouse wedding and party, but worried about excluding family members.

---

This post is a great example of the challenges that come with planning a wedding, especially when there are different expectations and opinions involved. The OP (original poster) is feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the pressure to have a big wedding, and is struggling to balance their own desires with the expectations of their soon-to-be in-laws.

The post is also a good example of the importance of communication and setting boundaries in relationships. The OP is feeling resentful and trapped by the pressure to have a big wedding, and is struggling to express their feelings and needs to their partner and in-laws. It's important for the OP to have open and honest conversations with their partner and in-laws about their feelings and expectations, and to set clear boundaries and priorities for the wedding planning process.

In terms of advice, the OP could consider having a conversation with their partner and in-laws about their feelings and concerns, and trying to find a compromise that works for everyone. They could also consider having a small, intimate wedding ceremony and reception, rather than a big, elaborate affair. Additionally, they could consider having a "screw you we got married at the courthouse now moving on from this" move, where they get married at the courthouse and then have a small celebration with close friends and family. This could be a way for them to assert their independence and move on from the wedding planning process.

Overall, this post is a great example of the challenges and complexities of wedding planning, and the importance of communication, compromise, and setting boundaries in relationships. It's a relatable and honest post that many people can identify with, and it's a great reminder that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires in the wedding planning process.

TITLE: Afraid of my (29f) husband (27m) leaving me at his cousins wedding.

POST: Okay well, not *leaving* leaving. I'm not very good with crowds- they make me incredibly anxious to the point where I'll have a panic attack. Knowing my husband will, at least, be there with me usually helps me feel more comfortable around crowds. I'll know a fair bit of people there, so it's not like I won't have anyone to talk to. It's just the sheer amount of people that makes me freak out. 

My husband, however, doesn't understand this. He enjoys going from one set of people he likes to another, and usually in ways that would a) be impossible for me to follow him or b) make it very creepy if I were to try. He always tells me I should just try opening up and talking to people without him, but with the amount (even over 20 people) will start to make me nervous. 

I don't want to hinder him in any way, and I don't want to be a "ball and chain" to him. But I also feel like he's a little bit obligated to me as his wife to reassure me if I'm scared or anxious. What should I do? Is there a way of explaining this rationally, or am I just being unreasonable.

TL;DR: Afraid of crowds at my husband's cousin's wedding, husband doesn't understand my anxiety and thinks I should just "open up" and talk to people. How can I explain this to him without being unreasonable?

---

This post is an example of a common issue in relationships: differing perspectives on social interactions. The wife is anxious about crowds and feels overwhelmed, while the husband doesn't understand her anxiety and thinks she should be able to handle it. The wife is seeking advice on how to explain her feelings to her husband without being unreasonable.

The post is well-written and provides context for the situation, including the wife's anxiety and her husband's perspective. The wife is also aware of her own limitations and doesn't want to hinder her husband's enjoyment of the event. The post is seeking a rational and understanding approach to addressing the issue.

The subreddit r/relationships is a great place for this post, as it is a community dedicated to discussing relationships and providing advice on how to navigate common issues that arise in romantic partnerships. The post is likely to receive thoughtful and empathetic responses from users who have experienced similar situations.

TITLE: (21/f) Husband (23/m) is honest and attracted to a coworker

POST: I have been in a relationship with my husband for 3 years now (married 1year) and we have a child. We fell in love in college but our relationship started with him choosing between me and another woman (we started as FWB) and after a bit of drama (nothing to dramatic really) he chose to be with me in a commited relationship. Fast foward to last year around october, we are enjoying sime alcoholic beverages and he lets it slip that in the very early days of our relationship he cheated on me...3 times. Of course I was shocked, hurt, angry, ect but we were married at this point and he was very ashamed so we talked about it and I decided to just try and handle it. I let him know that his trust card had been revoked and it would take a lot of work and time to get it back. well here we are now, he has been working at this place for 2 years and recently told me of a woman that works in the pffice upstairs for weeks her name kept coming up and I even gave him a book to give to her on a subject we are both interested in. Yesterday he confessed they were attracted to one another and that he felt bad because she flirted with him and he let her and he flirted back. He told he had been working up the courage to tell me for a couple weeks now and he tells me he will tell her today he can no longer be aroumd her or talk to her because of their attraction. Problem solved? 

I told him I was happy he told me and did not freak out on him because I want him to tell me these things in the future but my self esteem has always suffered and now it is even more crushed. I do not know what to think or feel or how to get over his past cheating and become a confident person. I feel lost.. Help?

TL;DR: Husband confessed to being attracted to a coworker and told me he will stop flirting with her. I'm happy he told me but my self esteem is crushed and I don't know how to get over his past cheating.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "OP, I'm so sorry to hear this. It's understandable that your self-esteem is crushed. It's not just about the current situation, but also the fact that he cheated on you in the past. It's going to take time and effort to rebuild your trust and confidence. Have you considered couples therapy? It might help you both work through these issues and strengthen your relationship."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being very understanding and mature about this situation. It takes a lot of courage to admit to attraction and take steps to address it. However, I do think you should have a conversation with your husband about how his past cheating has affected you. It's not just about the current situation, but also about the emotional scars it's left. You deserve to be heard and validated."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I agree with your husband's decision to tell you about his attraction to this coworker. While it's good that he's being honest, it's also a reminder that he's still attracted to someone else. Have you considered whether this is a sign of deeper issues in your relationship? Are you happy in your marriage, or are there underlying problems that need to be addressed?"
4. **u/relationship_advice**: "OP, I think you're doing the right thing by not freaking out and giving your husband space to work through his feelings. However, I do think you need to have a conversation with him about how his past cheating has affected you. It's not just about the current situation, but also about the emotional scars it's left.

TITLE: Reddit, am I in trouble with the law?

POST: Hi! I was just DD'ing for my friends on a saturday night. I have expired plates as of may 30th and my insurance proof was at home.  A cop pulled me over to tell me that my plates were expired. I understand I should not have been driving but I have been late on getting them renewed (this is in canada by the way).

The officer took my license and asked me for my proof of insurance, I did not have it so I told him so. He gave me back my license and did not ticket me or anything, he merely told me to meet him at the station before his shift tomorrow and bring the insurance proof. Currently am I in trouble? 

The problem is the station is way across the city and I don't want to drive without my plates renewed. If I did not make the trip to show him my insurance proof tomorrow as he requested will he be able to ticket me or arrest me, he does have my name and license number and all the information on the license but the address on my license is not mine.. what I really want to know is that as of right now if I do not drive my car until I have my tags and insurance up to date and do not provide the documents the police officer asked me to provide will I be in trouble

TL;DR: Got pulled over for expired plates, didn't have insurance proof, officer took my license and asked me to meet him at the station tomorrow to provide proof. I'm worried about getting in trouble if I don't show up or don't provide the proof. Am I in trouble right now?

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDIT**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "You're not in trouble yet, but you're definitely on thin ice. If you don't show up to the station tomorrow, you're likely going to get a ticket or worse. Just take the hour to get your insurance proof and plates renewed, and go to the station. It's not worth the risk of getting in deeper trouble."
* **u/CanadianCynic**: "As a Canadian, I can tell you that the officer is doing his job. You should take this as an opportunity to get your plates and insurance up to date. If you don't show up to the station, you'll likely get a ticket and possibly a fine. Just do the right thing and take care of it."
* **u/Anonymous12345**: "I'd recommend getting a lawyer or a paralegal to help you with this situation. They can advise you on what to do and how to handle the situation. It's always better to be safe than sorry."
* **u/Redditor123**: "I'd say you're in a bit of a pickle, but it's not the end of the world. Just take care of your plates and insurance, and go to the station. If you don't show up, you'll likely get in trouble. But if you do show up and provide the proof, you should be okay."

**ADDITIONAL TIPS**

* Make sure to get your plates and insurance up to date as soon as possible.
* Consider getting a lawyer or paralegal to help you with the situation.
* Be honest and transparent with the officer when you go to the station.
* Take the opportunity to learn from this experience and make sure to keep your plates and insurance up to date in the future.

**CONCLUSION**

The advice from Reddit suggests that the OP is not in trouble yet, but they are on thin ice. The officer is doing his job, and the OP should take this as an opportunity to get their plates and insurance up to date. If they don't show up to the station, they'll likely get a ticket and possibly a fine. It's recommended that the OP takes care of their plates and insurance and goes to the station to provide the proof. If they don't show up, they'll likely get in trouble. But if they do show up and provide the proof, they should be okay. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and getting a lawyer or paralegal to help with the situation is a good idea.

TITLE: Me [22M] cut contact from a girl [23F], she ended up texting me today.. need advice

POST: Cut contact with this girl because she still had a boyfriend.  I let her know that I saw us as more then friends and that when she becomes single for her to contact me and if not best of luck with everything.

three days later I get a text (legit 10 minutes ago).  
She said, "Just so you know we broke up."  (meaning her and her boyfriend.)  Now, I do not know how to respond, do I ask why, ask her how come, ask her when... 

Thing is we have been friends for a few months and I just could not do the friends thing anymore, so I decided cutting contact would be in MY best interests.  I can not ask her on any dates though because she is in Florida till october, and I just need advice on how to approach this situation.  Such as how to handle, stay in contact, be there for her, all the while keeping attraction up to what it was beforehand so that when she comes home our lives can intertwine again.

Thanks Reddit,

TL;DR: Cut contact with a girl who was still in a relationship, she broke up with her boyfriend and just texted me.  Need advice on how to respond, stay in contact, and keep attraction up.

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway1234567**: "Dude, you're in a weird spot. I'd say respond with something like 'Sorry to hear about the breakup, but I'm still not interested in being friends.' You don't owe her an explanation, but you can be kind and empathetic. If she's looking for someone to talk to, you can offer to listen, but don't get too invested."
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "I'd say take a step back and don't respond right away. Give yourself some time to process your emotions and think about what you really want. If you're still interested in her, you can try to stay in touch, but don't make any promises you're not sure you can keep. Remember, you cut contact for a reason, so don't feel obligated to rekindle things just because she's single now."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're overthinking this. Just respond with a simple 'Sorry to hear about the breakup' and leave it at that. You don't need to ask her why or when, and you definitely shouldn't be asking her out on dates. You're not obligated to be her shoulder to cry on or her rebound guy. Just be kind and move on."
4. **Redditor123**: "I'd say try to stay in touch, but don't make it too obvious. You can send her a message every now and then, just to check in and see how she's doing. But don't overdo it, and don't make her feel like you're waiting for her to come back to you. Just be genuine and friendly, and see where things go."
5. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I think you're being a bit too focused on keeping attraction up. You cut contact for a reason, and you need to respect that. If you're still interested in her, you can try to stay in touch, but don't make any promises you're not sure you can keep. And remember, attraction is not the only thing that matters in a relationship. You need to think about what you really want and what's best for you."

TITLE: Is there a name for this phenomenon?

POST: I went to the bar last night for a friend's 21st. When I returned home, I went to sleep.

During my sleep I had a very intense dream about myself and several friends being held hostage in my own house by 14 armed men (probably because my thoughts were still on the fact that my house was burglarized yesterday morning). In this dream, I kept trying to escape the hostage-takers, but consistently failed. Then, when the dream got to the part where I was supposed to be shot, I jolted awake and realized I hadn't set my alarm before going to sleep.

Thinking I was very late for work, I panicked, jumped out of bed, and looked over at my alarm clock to see the time was 8:25am - 5 minutes before the time my alarm clock would have gone off had I remembered to set it.

TL;DR: I had a dream about being held hostage, woke up 5 minutes before my alarm would have gone off, and now I'm wondering if there's a name for this phenomenon.

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon known as "sleep paralysis." Sleep paralysis is a condition where a person is unable to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up, often accompanied by hallucinations and a sense of fear or terror. The post describes a vivid dream about being held hostage, which is a common theme in sleep paralysis experiences. The fact that the person woke up just before their alarm would have gone off, feeling panicked and disoriented, is also consistent with sleep paralysis.

The post also mentions the idea of "sleep inertia," which is the feeling of grogginess and disorientation that can occur when waking up from a nap or a full night's sleep. However, the post is primarily focused on the experience of sleep paralysis and the vivid dream that accompanied it.

The comments on the post are varied, with some people sharing their own experiences with sleep paralysis and others offering explanations for the phenomenon. Some commenters suggest that the dream may have been triggered by the stress of the friend's 21st birthday party, while others propose that the dream may have been a manifestation of the person's subconscious mind processing the recent burglary. Overall, the post provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of sleep paralysis and the strange and often frightening experiences that can occur during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.

TITLE: Second-guessing my AWESOME relationship and I need help reddit!

POST: I'm a 24/m in a great relationship with a 19/f. We've been together for almost 10 months and things are good. She's WONDERFUL and I couldn't ask for anything more. She's cute, smart, funny, independent and so supportive it's almost scary. However, I find myself second-guessing our relationship. Thoughts almost constantly plague me about whether or not she's "who I'm supposed to be with." To be honest redditors, I'm scared. To make things more complicated she just moved in(after having BIG problems with her previous roommate and not having anywhere else to really go). I want her around, I want her in my life but I just don't know what to do(or not do). I find myself with "grass is greener" syndrome and every other mildly cute girl I see I wonder if it'd be better with them. I have no idea what better would be though. I love her and my family loves her yet I find myself doubting this good thing we have. I want to get out of my own way and be happy. Any suggestions? I REALLY want this to work.. it's the best relationship I've ever had!

Thanks guys

TL;DR: 24/m in a great relationship with 19/f. We've been together 10 months and things are good. I'm second-guessing our relationship and having thoughts about whether she's "who I'm supposed to be with." I'm scared and unsure what to do. I want to be happy and make this work.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, you're being ridiculous. You're 24 and she's 19. That's a huge age gap. You're basically a grown man and she's still a teenager. You're probably just feeling guilty about the age difference and that's causing your doubts.
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: OP, I think you're being unfair to your girlfriend. You're saying she's WONDERFUL and you love her, but then you're doubting whether she's "who you're supposed to be with." That's not fair to her. You need to focus on what you have and work on building a strong relationship with her. Stop comparing her to other girls and focus on the good things about your relationship.
3. **SkepticalSally**: I agree with RelationshipWarrior. You're being unfair to your girlfriend. You're also being unrealistic. You're expecting her to be perfect and meet all your needs. Newsflash: no one is perfect. Everyone has flaws. You need to learn to accept and work with her flaws, not expect her to change to fit your ideal.
4. **ConcernedCousin**: OP, I'm concerned about the age gap too. But I think you're also struggling with your own insecurities. You're 24 and she's 19, but you're also 5 years older than her. That's a big difference. You need to work on building your own confidence and self-worth. Stop comparing yourself to other guys and focus on being the best version of yourself.
5. **RelationshipCoach**: OP, I think you're experiencing a common phenomenon called "relationship anxiety." It's normal to feel uncertain or doubtful about your relationship, especially when you're in a new or long-term relationship. But you need to focus on building trust and communication with your girlfriend. Talk to her about your feelings and concerns. Work on building a strong foundation of trust and respect. And remember, relationships take work and effort from both partners. Don't expect her to fix all your problems or make you happy all the time. You need to take responsibility for your own happiness and well-being.

---

**Subreddit's Response:**

The subreddit community responded with a mix of comments, some of which were supportive and encouraging, while others were more critical and skeptical. The comments ranged from "you're being ridiculous" to "you're experiencing normal relationship anxiety." Some users suggested that the OP was being unfair to his girlfriend and needed to focus on building a strong relationship with her, while others encouraged him to work on his own insecurities and self-worth.

The subreddit's response highlights the complexity of relationships and the challenges that come with navigating them. It also shows that even in a community focused on providing advice and support, there can be differing opinions and perspectives on how to approach relationship issues. Ultimately, the OP's decision to seek advice and support from the subreddit community demonstrates his willingness to work through his doubts and concerns and build a stronger relationship with his girlfriend.

TITLE: It's my Dad's Birthday, and I'm out of ideas!

POST: So going through my head trying to think of the things I have already bought him and what he needs, but now I'm stumped! He's a guitar teacher, so obviously he's very musical, he likes old movies and red wine. I have managed to be super creative in these categories for the past 15 of his birthdays but seeing as he has seen nearly every good pre 70s movie under the sun and he's bound to get really nice wines as gifts from his students, I just wanted to be a bit more creative this year.

TITLE: Reddit, I am a narcoleptic who has lost hope

POST: So, I never thought it might come to this.

I have narcolepsy. For the longest time, I felt that I had it under control. In school, my condition was misunderstood and I was ridiculed by my peers as well as my teachers. I overcame and found a nice job. I was laid off because of the recession and took up a job with a certain job with a certain game-related company. I tried my best to excel at my job, to the point where I became the Go-To-Guy for information on technical resolutions and policy matters. 

Today, I was demoted because my narcolepsy sometimes gets the better of me and I miss work. I cannot afford medical insurance nor the medicine to make it less of an issue ($500 for a month's supply). I was told that the ADA did not apply because attendance was a hard requirement for being a higher level agent. Our HR person told me that any job I get will have a requirement about attendance and that the ADA will never side with me. I am forced to assume an entry level position in a job I used to love. I feel as though my hard work will never pay off now, because my narcolepsy will also stop me from advancing and that ADA does not apply to me. 

I still feel like I'm being discriminated against but if what HR told me is true then I do believe that any career I take will be hampered by this condition, which cannot be cured. 

Please, tell me there are options. I feel as though I'm about to slip into a state of depression that I had left behind me so long ago. I don't want to be there. Please, tell me that there is hope.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons..

TL;DR: I have narcolepsy and was demoted from my job because of it. I can't afford insurance or medication and was told that the ADA won't help me. I feel like I'll never advance in my career because of my condition. I'm feeling hopeless and depressed. Please help.

TITLE: My [19F] boyfriend [20M] is failing out of college and I'm not. I have absolutely no idea what to do.

POST: Hi guys. I'm gonna keep this short for privacy reasons. Also throwaway. 

My boyfriend is a wonderful, sweet, caring person, but no matter how hard he works, he is just not good at school. We go to a competitive college (his dream school) and he's currently stuggling. If he has one more bad semester, he'll have to transfer to a smaller school and live at home for financial reasons. 

On the other hand, my grades are pretty good. I'm no scholar, but I do well. 

I have no idea how to be there for him through this without sounding like a jackass. I can't really empathize with him because I've never been through that. I can tell he's frustrated and disappointed, but he also doesn't want to talk about it. 

I love him so much and it kills me to see him like this. Anyone have any ideas about how to make him feel better? Should I let him work through it on his own? I'd really rather talk to him about it to show that I care about him and that I'll be there for him. 

How do I bring it up? How can I help him to not feel so bad about this? How can I let him know that if he has to transfer it'll be okay? I don't know how to bring it up without sounding like I think he's definitely going to fail out?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is struggling in college and I'm not. I want to be supportive, but I don't know how to bring it up without sounding like a jackass. Help!

TITLE: Me (21/f) broke up with my bf (23/m) a week ago. Was it the right thing to do?

POST: note: throwaway because he's a reddit lurker.

me and my boyfriend would have been together for a year at the end of the month. We broke up after a conversation a week ago about our happiness came up (I asked if he was happy and what was happening to us after a weird patch). We mutually decided to end it and stay friends but I'm starting to regret it.

I'm worried that our unhappiness was merely due to my health problems and school stress getting me down and his sister is dying making him unhappy. I have felt worse than ever since and I just want to be with him. I told him I missed him last night and he told me he misses me too.

Also, a big part of me not thinking it was exactly the best idea to work it out was that next year i'm leaving for a month or two to travel then in 2.5 years when I finish studying I plan on leaving to find a new home somewhere in this big world. He says travelling doesn't interest him when it's my whole life plan to travel. Yet since meeting him my life plan wants to include him, what if he doesn't change his mind?

Do you guys think it's a good idea to talk to him about this all? I'm worried that if I do and he doesn't want to work this out the friendship we have will go to shit and I will be left COMPLETELY alone - note: i have very little friends as it is, none of which I can talk to about my health problems, he's my guy. I don't want to lose my friend.

TL;DR: broke up with bf a week ago, regretting it, worried about losing our friendship if we don't work it out. Should I talk to him about my concerns?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to hold onto something that's not meant to be. You're both at different stages in your lives and it's okay to acknowledge that. If he's not willing to work on the issues that led to the breakup, it's probably for the best to focus on your own growth and happiness."
* "I think you should talk to him about your concerns, but also be prepared for the possibility that he may not be on the same page. It's okay to have different priorities and goals in life. Maybe you can have an open and honest conversation about what you both want and see if there's a way to make it work, but also be prepared to accept that it may not be meant to be."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling so strongly about getting back together. Is it because you genuinely feel like you're meant to be together, or is it because you're scared of being alone? If it's the latter, then maybe you should focus on building a stronger sense of self and finding happiness on your own terms."
* "I think you should talk to him, but also be prepared for the possibility that he may not be willing to work on the issues that led to the breakup. It's okay to have different priorities and goals in life, and it's okay to acknowledge that sometimes things don't work out. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and if that means being alone for a while, then so be it."
* "I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own happiness. It's okay to take a break from the relationship and focus on your own growth and development. You can always reach out to him in the future if you feel like you're ready to reconnect, but for now, focus on yourself and your own well-being."



**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is regretting the breakup and is worried about losing their friendship if they don't work it out.
* The comments suggest that the OP should take time to reflect on their feelings and priorities, and consider whether they're holding onto the relationship out of fear or a genuine desire to be together.
* The comments also suggest that the OP should be prepared for the possibility that their partner may not be willing to work on the issues that led to the breakup, and that it's okay to acknowledge that sometimes things don't work out.
* The comments encourage the OP to focus on their own happiness and well-being, and to prioritize their own growth and development.

TITLE: I [20f] think I might have fucked up a friendship and I don't know what to do.

POST: So me and my best friend, "Jane" [21f] have been best friends for about a year, prior to us knowing each other she dated "Paul" [23m]. They broke up, but they're still friends. The three of us took a summer class together and we were pretty much inseparable. Get back to main campus and "Paul" dates this other girl and "Jane" is upset and doesn't talk to him for a month. Flash forward a year to present, the three of us are still very close, hangout most weekends. Now I kinda like Paul now, but I've been ignoring that because he dated Jane, so I know I shouldn't and I casually date a few other guys. Well this past weekend Jane goes home (we're college students). So friday night I'm texting Paul and we discover we're both about to watch the same movie. He asks if I wanna watch it with him, and I know I should have said no, but I didn't. So we watch the movie at his place and then go to a friend's and everythings fine. He drives me home and then tells me he's had a crush on me since my freshman year, when he was dating Jane. I told him I liked him too, but we couldn't do anything because of Jane and we had a good thing going and we should keep that way. He agrees and apologizes several times that night and even the next day.  What I'm wondering is do I tell Jane, I tell her everything, but I think telling her may hurt more than help, since I kind of suspect she has some residual feelings. Also I think I hurt him because I feel like hanging out with him on a Friday night lead him to do this. Right now we're still texting and I think we're just ignoring it, but he left early for his class today instead of hanging out with us. I feel so guilty and selfish and I dont know how to make this better.

TL;DR: I think I might have messed up a friendship by hanging out with my ex's friend, who I've developed feelings for, and I don't know what to do. Should I tell my friend about it, and how can I make it right?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not your fault. You didn't know he had feelings for you. But yeah, it's probably best to have a conversation with Jane about it. Be honest and apologize for any hurt you may have caused. It's better to be upfront and clear than to keep secrets."
* "I think you should tell Jane, but not right away. Take some time to process your feelings and figure out what you want to do. It's not fair to Jane to keep it from her, but it's also not fair to her to dump all this on her without giving her a chance to process it herself."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your friendships. If you're feeling guilty and selfish, it might be because you're not being honest with yourself about your feelings. Maybe it's time to take a break from the group and focus on yourself for a bit."
* "I think you should talk to Paul and tell him how you're feeling. If he's really interested in you, he'll understand and respect your decision. And if he's not, then you can move on and focus on your own relationships."
* "I think you should just be honest with Jane and tell her everything. It's better to be upfront and clear than to keep secrets. And who knows, maybe she'll be understanding and you can all still be friends."

TITLE: TIFU by not wanting to be rude to a hairdresser

POST: This happened about an hour ago. I went to get a haircut as my hair was getting too long, I usually have it cut by the same girl but today I got booked in last minute and had someone new. She sat me down and asked what I wanted and since I've only really had one hairdresser for the past two years I've gotten used to not saying what I want. So I say "I don't know", but she still fires questions at me and I reply as best I can saying "Not to short" and "Yes she does use clippers" (referring to the other hair dresser). Eventually she gets started, and this is where I fuck up. She takes number 4 clippers and takes a chunk of hair out of left side of my head, I only expected her to trim around the edges but she went all in, I should have stopped her but I just don't have it in me to be rude. So I try to stay calm and let her finnish, after all, she is a professional. She completes the final touches... And it looks terrible. I have a long face, if that makes sense, and the way she cut it makes it look even longer. Now I'm sitting inside not wanting to venture outside for at least 3 weeks, but I have school in 2 days. Do you think I'm overreaching a bit?

TL;DR: I got a haircut from a new hairdresser and didn't specify what I wanted, she cut my hair too short and it looks terrible. I didn't want to be rude and didn't stop her, now I'm stuck with a bad haircut and school in 2 days.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a story of a mistake they made and the consequences that followed. In this case, the author didn't specify what they wanted in their haircut and didn't stop the hairdresser when they were cutting too much hair, resulting in a bad haircut.

The post is relatable and humorous, with the author's self-deprecating tone and the use of phrases like "I should have stopped her but I just don't have it in me to be rude" and "I'm stuck with a bad haircut and school in 2 days". The post also elicits sympathy from readers, who can imagine themselves in the author's shoes and understand their frustration and embarrassment.

The comments on the post are also entertaining, with many readers sharing their own stories of bad haircuts and offering advice on how to deal with the situation. Some readers even offer to help the author come up with a plan to fix their haircut, showing the sense of community and support that exists on the r/tifu subreddit. Overall, this post is a great example of the type of content that is shared on the r/tifu subreddit and the type of community that exists there.

TITLE: I [20F] think I want to end my relationship with my Father [46 M]

POST: So growing up I have always had a good relationship with both my parents. They were great parents and there's nothing I can honestly complain about with how they raised me. I was also really close to my Dad when growing up. Please believe me when I say he wasn't always a jerk. He was a good Dad and husband. He taught me a lot and helped me to become the independent person I am today. 

Unfortunately, he is not that person anymore. Over the last two years he has just kind of been gone. He would not come home. for days. If he did come home he was always really drunk. Later I found out he was also under the influence of some drugs. He also cheated on my mom with a girl around my age. 

So I watched my Dad go from a happy-go-lucky guy to a sad, pathetic drunk. In May this all came to a head. It was a really tough time for my family. My Dad eventually told my Mom and I he was going to stop and he was going to get help. So, we tried to rebuild the family. 

I actually got to see my Dad happy again. He stopped drinking and doing drugs. He seemed to be making progress and I was getting ready to forgive him

Well, long story short, he was caught cheating again and doing the previously mentioned things. I just can't handle it. Why did he not just leave back in May? It could of been done with months ago. I just feel even more hurt now. 

I know he does not want me to cut him out of my life, but I don't know what else to do. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? Also, would it be better to just cut him out of my life completely? 

Sorry for the rambling. This is all pretty fresh still.

TL;DR: I'm 20F and my 46-year-old Dad has been struggling with addiction and infidelity. He's made progress, but recently got caught cheating again. I'm feeling hurt and don't know what to do. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Should I cut him out of my life completely?

TITLE: My friend's [27M] girlfriend has a serious issue with me [27F] for no reason. He won't address it.

POST: I've been very good friends with my friend, Chris, for 4 years. We met through my ex and we've always had a completely platonic friendship (I was also good friends with his ex-wife at the time). He's been in a relationship with his current girlfriend (Angela) for about a year and a half. For numerous reasons, I've only met her once about a year ago and she was very sweet and friendly. Since then we haven't seen each other because she travels for work and that's when Chris and I catch up; additionally, she has her own social life and on days when she wants to be alone with her friends, he and I will grab dinner. She never has a problem with that as far as I know.

Anyway, I went out with Chris, Angela, and another couple on Saturday and when we were exchanging hello's she just glared at me. No response. I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. 

The next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all. I was shocked and hurt, and he defended his decision not to ask because he has bigger priorities now (they're having problems-- no wonder). This is out of character for him.

I've never done anything to warrant this type of treatment and I'm concerned because we'll be at the same event in a couple of weeks hosted by his brother. I feel like I deserve an explanation, or at the very least, someone should raise the issue with her.

How do I discuss this again with Chris? :(

TL;DR: My friend's girlfriend has been ignoring me for no reason, and he won't address it. We've been friends for 4 years, and I've never done anything to warrant this treatment. I'm hurt and concerned about our upcoming event together. How do I discuss this with Chris again? 

---

**Community Response:**

* Many users are shocked and concerned by Angela's behavior, and some are surprised that Chris is not addressing the issue.
* Some users suggest that Chris may be avoiding the issue because he's going through a tough time in his relationship and doesn't want to rock the boat.
* Others recommend that the OP (original poster) have an open and honest conversation with Chris about how she's feeling, and suggest that she express her concerns and feelings in a non-accusatory way.
* Some users suggest that the OP consider having a conversation with Angela directly, but others advise against this, saying that it could lead to more conflict and drama.
* A few users suggest that the OP take a step back and re-evaluate the friendship, as it may be time to distance herself from Chris and Angela if they're not willing to address the issue.

**Notable Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like Angela is being really unfair and Chris is enabling her behavior by not addressing it. You deserve better than to be treated like this. Have a calm and honest conversation with Chris about how you're feeling and see if you can get some resolution."
* "I think Chris is avoiding the issue because he's going through a tough time in his relationship. Maybe try having a conversation with him when he's in a better headspace?"
* "I would not recommend talking to Angela directly. She's already shown that she's not interested in communicating with you, and it could lead to more conflict and drama. Stick with Chris and try to get him to address the issue."
* "I think it's time for you to re-evaluate the friendship. If Chris and Angela are not willing to address this issue, it may be time to distance yourself from them. You deserve better than to be treated like this."

TITLE: I [18 F] started seeing someone [24 M] for the past couple months, should I be concerned by the age gap?

POST: What do you make of this age difference?  In the beginning I wasn't bothered by it, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe there is something wrong with this relationship. 

We get along great and share a lot of the same interests.  He has a full time job and I just started uni.  I'm conflicted because I like him and feel that we have great chemistry, but we are in two very different places in our lives and I don't want to be taken advantage of.  He's never made me feel like the lesser individual in the relationship but I'd appreciate any input on the situation so that I can proceed in a way that is healthy for us both.

TL;DR: 18F started seeing 24M for a couple months, concerned about the 6-year age gap.  We get along great, share interests, but I'm worried about being taken advantage of due to our different life stages.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Honestly, the age gap isn't the biggest concern here. What's more important is whether you're on the same page regarding your future plans and goals. Are you both thinking about long-term commitment or is this just a casual thing?
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: It's great that you're thinking critically about this relationship! The age gap can be a challenge, but it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. What's more important is whether you're compatible and whether you're both on the same page regarding your future plans. Have you talked about your goals and aspirations with him?
3. **SkepticalSarah**: I'd be concerned about the power dynamic in this relationship. As the younger partner, you may be more vulnerable to being taken advantage of. Have you talked about your expectations and boundaries with him? Are you comfortable with the idea of him being in a position of authority or control?
4. **AgeIsJustANumber**: I think you're overthinking this. The age gap is just a number. What matters is whether you're compatible and whether you're both happy in the relationship. Don't let societal expectations or concerns about being taken advantage of dictate your decisions. Focus on what you want and what makes you happy.
5. **ConcernedCitizen**: I think you should be concerned about the age gap, especially since you're just starting uni and he has a full-time job. That's a significant difference in life stage and responsibilities. Have you talked about how you see your future unfolding and whether you're both on the same page?

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post highlight the importance of considering the age gap in the context of the relationship as a whole. While the age gap itself is not necessarily a deal-breaker, it's essential to think critically about the power dynamic, compatibility, and future plans with your partner. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your concerns and expectations. Ultimately, the decision to continue the relationship or not depends on your individual circumstances and what you feel is best for you.

TITLE: [19M] There's this girl [19F] I like. Does she likes me back?

POST: We go to german lessons together, I met her a week ago. Our 'german group' is really small (only 6 people) and we're actually the only people talking to each other. 

She is very kind and friendly towards me and tries to initiate chat. She laughs hysterically(!) at some of my jokes (she doesn't laugh at ALL of them). She says "hello" in a very seductive way, yeah I know that's a stupid thing to say but I've never been greeted by a girl this way.

Note that this girl is BEAUTIFUL. And I mean perfect 10/10 and probably gets any guy she wants. I gotta say I'm an average looking guy, slightly above average in best case. I'm really not that funny guy, I don't lack social skills but I'm a bit weird, in a positive way. 

In normal circumstances, I'd say she's into me. But I really have nothing to show her what other guys don't already have! 

Is she maybe pranking me?

Or does she genuinely likes me?

TL;DR: I like this girl, she's beautiful, kind, and friendly towards me. She laughs at my jokes and greets me in a seductive way. Is she into me or is it just a prank?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway12345**: Dude, you're overthinking this. She's just being friendly and kind. Don't read too much into it. Maybe she's just a nice person?
2. **german_guru**: I'm a native German speaker and I can tell you that the way she greets you is probably just a cultural thing. Germans are known for being direct and straightforward, so it's possible she's just being friendly and not trying to flirt.
3. **relationship_rookie**: I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not average looking, you're just... unique. And who says you need to be funny to be liked? Maybe she likes your quirks and weirdness.
4. **skeptical_sam**: I'm not buying it. If she's really into you, she wouldn't be so obvious about it. She's probably just being friendly and you're reading too much into it.
5. **german_groupie**: I'm in the same German group as you and I can confirm that she's always been friendly and kind to everyone. Maybe she's just a nice person who likes to make people laugh?
6. **romantic_rick**: Dude, you gotta take a chance! If you don't ask her out, you'll always wonder what could've been. Just be yourself and see what happens.

**OP's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I think I'm just going to take a chance and ask her out. I'll try to be myself and see what happens. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes! Thanks for the advice and reassurance!

TITLE: I need a gift idea for my daughter's first day of kindergarten. Help me, Reddit.

POST: My little girl was born 7 1/2 weeks early (which was also six weeks past the age cutoff for our school district).

After two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).
Now, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.

We've been terrified for a while of her having to wait an entire year for her to start kindergarten because she'd probably end up a huge discipline problem and start-off her entire school experience on a terrible foot.

After months of looking, we finally found a private school willing to bend the rules for her and that we can afford.  Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.

So, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.

But, I'm drawing a blank.  I've thought about jewelry, but what can I find that would withstand a kid that young and be something she'd want to keep as she gets older?

Help me, reddit!  You're my only hope.

TL;DR: My 4 1/2-year-old daughter is starting kindergarten early due to her accelerated development. I want to give her a special gift on her first day, but I'm struggling to find something that's both durable and meaningful for a young child. Help me come up with a gift idea!

REDDIT RESPONSES:

1. "A personalized book with her name and a special message would be a great idea! You could also consider a customized pencil case or a special backpack tag with her name and initials."
2. "How about a special 'big girl' journal or diary? It's something she can use to express herself and document her kindergarten adventures. You could even include a few prompts or stickers to get her started."
3. "A customized water bottle or lunchbox with her name and a fun design would be a practical and thoughtful gift. She can use it throughout her kindergarten year and beyond."
4. "Consider a special 'first day of kindergarten' picture frame or a customized photo album with pictures from her early years. It's a thoughtful way to commemorate this milestone and create a keepsake for her to treasure."
5. "A gift card to her favorite bookstore or a subscription to a children's magazine would be a great way to encourage her love of reading and learning. You could also consider a special'reader's reward' certificate with a fun prize or activity."
6. "A personalized keychain or charm with her name or initials would be a thoughtful and meaningful gift. She can attach it to her backpack or lunchbox and take it with her on her kindergarten adventures."
7. "How about a special 'big girl' outfit or accessory, like a sparkly tiara or a pair of fun socks? It's a fun way to celebrate her transition to kindergarten and make her feel like a 'big girl'."

These responses offer a range of gift ideas that are both durable and meaningful for a young child. They also take into account the child's accelerated development and her love of reading and learning. The suggestions are practical, thoughtful, and designed to help the child feel special and celebrated on her first day of kindergarten.

TITLE: Reddit, i need your help with a girl.... its complicated.

POST: alright so some background info - im 19 and just finished school, i live in australia and am going to college in a couple months in Canberra (australias capital). About 4 weeks back i went to Europe with my family - we went all over Europe on holiday (zermatt, then chamonee, then paris then...

Reddit, ive had girlfriends before but ive never met a girl who made me stutter like this, or a girl who made me so happy like she does and did..
The cutest thing about it was that we both had done 3 yrs of french and 3 yrs of english each, so our talking was very funny ^.^ and there was often a dictionary close by... for the longer sentences we used translators on iphone.

now to the question : 
i have dreamt of her every day since i got back from france, and every time i do i find myself smiling.

Reddit... what do i do?
im not happy here, i cant find purpose in my life without her and even if she doesnt feel the same way just to be near her would be enough for me.. just to be her friend and see her smile...
but i dont have the money and my parents refuse to send me on any elaborate holidays... i also wouldnt be able to get along in france without knowing the language..

im lost reddit... and ive come to you.

TITLE: Long distance girlfriend [24 F] of six months is moving again but not back where I [30 M] am.

POST: I got into a long-distance relationship about six months ago, right before my girlfriend made a temporary move. We were just getting to know each other at first, but things kept snowballing as we got to know each other and we got more emotionally involved. She has been back once since then and things kept building to the point that we were talking about life plans when she returned.

The problem is that she's now not going to return for several years.

The plan was that she would be back here for graduate school, but it turns out that she got an offer she can't turn down somewhere else. It's going to be a multi-year commitment of lots of work, and there's no guarantee she will ever be back here, even though it's currently part of her long-term plan.

So the options now are to give up or go with her. Neither really feels like the right choice. I encouraged her to go to the school because the offer was too good to pass up, and I'm not about to ask her to take out substantially larger amounts of debt so we can be together. But with her going to school, she will be locked in for several years and maybe longer once she starts her career. I can travel to see her more often than we have so far, but ultimately, I would have to move at some point. 

As for me, I'm further in my career, and it's unfortunately not one where good opportunities come up very often. I also have friends, connections and a current job where I am and wouldn't have chosen the city she's moving to for myself if I were to move. I worry that if I go, she will be all I have in this new place.

We both want to be with each other and have said that we thought this could be a lifelong relationship. We are both heartbroken at the thought of giving up, but staying together doesn't seem to be an option either.

Any words of wisdom from someone who has made long-distance work? Or from someone who has moved solely for another person? I'm heartbroken and distraught all at the same time.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of six months is moving away for several years for a job opportunity. We both want to be together, but it seems like we have to choose between giving up or going with her. I'm further in my career and have connections in my current city, and I worry about leaving everything behind. Any advice would be appreciated.

TITLE: Me (22/F) and my boyfriend (31/m) of 2 years. Feeling rejected.

POST: Hey r/relationships, I need your advice. I'm posting this on mobile so I'm sorry in advance for any formatting errors! 

I met my boyfriend, L, 2 years ago. We hit it off instantly and the chemistry between us was insane. I know the age difference seems a little strange, but we've made it work with very little struggle until now.

We moved in together in August after dating for about 1.5 years. When we first started dating, we were having sex every time we saw each other. That was 5-7 times a week. Naturally as our relationship matured, the sex slowed down a little bit. For the past year and a half, we have sex maybe twice a month, and I have to initiate it every time. Since we've lived together (4 months) he has initiated once. Now I'm not naive, and I know he watches porn and masturbates daily. I've come across the porn on his phone. I've been trying to tell myself that I'm perfectly ok with this and that it doesn't hurt me at all. But I can't lie to myself anymore. I am hurt. He chooses porn over me daily. I've tried to talk to him before about how the fact that he never initiates sex with me hurts my feelings and makes me feel unwanted, and those conversations lead to him giving me a thousand excuses and initiating once the next day and everything goes back to the way it was for a few months. I've never brought up the porn because I'm really scared he will choose it over me... He really is the love of my life and other than this, our relationship is nearly perfect. He is a very caring man and I know he is who I want to spend the rest of my life with. R/relationships, how do I fix our sex life? I want to have sex more often, and I want him to initiate it more. I know I need to have a conversation with him, but I don't know where to begin.

TL;DR: 22F, 2-year relationship with 31M. We have sex maybe twice a month, and I have to initiate it every time. He watches porn daily and masturbates. I'm hurt and feel unwanted. How do I fix our sex life and get him to initiate more?

TITLE: My ex [20 F] of 3 years, asks me [20 M] to drive 500kms and get them.

POST: My ex and I have been ex's for about 5 months. She broke the relationship off, she said her feelings for me had faded. I was truly heartbroken and I am still progressing this, but feel less for her every day now days. Within this time we've talked a little, mostly basic questions like how eachother is doing.

I figured out a couple of days ago that I still have a couple of things at her place, a grillpan, and a couple of other things. Now we live about 500 kms apart, so get it is really not that easy. So I messaged her about it. It goes a day or two, she messages back that she can't find a box that big for the pan to fit in. I replyed that she can buy a large box, she claims she does not know where to buy one big enough.

In the next message she askes "Stupid question, but you wouldn't be able to come here and pick them up? :)".

As much as I still have still feelings for her, but certainly not as much as before. I wonder what she really wants. I don't want to be rude either, we handled this breakup like two adults. I don't know if I want to see her, as she was my first love of course she will be special to me. What can I reply to this?

If a longer version is needed, I think I can provide one.

TL;DR: Ex of 3 years asks me to drive 500kms to pick up a couple of things, what do I do?

TITLE: Teachers vs. Unions - What do you think?

POST: Here are some thoughts, and feel free to chime in - this is a discussion not a debate.  I believe teachers should be well paid, based on merit.  They should have to take examinations and re-up their credentials on a regular basis.  They are, after all, the most important people in the world.

Here's the dilemma.  Teacher Unions are the scummiest, worst organizations in the world.  Yes, they protect teachers (some of the time) but put most of their effort in making money from (underpaid) teachers in order to perpetuate the myth teachers will die without a union to back them.

Sadly, in the US, teachers would likely get ass-raped by the powers that be if they didn't have a union at all.  So it's kind of a catch-22.

What do you folks think?

TL;DR: Teachers should be well paid, but teacher unions are corrupt and make money off underpaid teachers.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: I'm a teacher and I agree with you. Unions are necessary to protect us from the system, but they can be corrupt and self-serving. I've seen it firsthand. We need a balance between protecting teachers and making sure they're not just lining their own pockets.
2. **u/teacher_tales**: As a teacher, I can attest that unions are essential. Without them, we'd be at the mercy of administrators who would take advantage of us. But, I agree that some unions can be corrupt. We need to hold them accountable and make sure they're working for the teachers, not just themselves.
3. **u/union_buster**: Unions are the problem. They're just a way for teachers to get a free ride and not have to work hard. If teachers were held accountable for their performance, they'd be more motivated to do their jobs well.
4. **u/teacher_rock**: I'm a teacher and I love my union. They've helped me negotiate better pay and benefits. But, I agree that some unions can be corrupt. We need to make sure they're transparent and accountable to their members.
5. **u/education_reform**: The problem isn't the unions, it's the system. We need to rethink how we fund education and hold schools accountable for student outcomes. Teachers should be paid based on performance, not seniority.
6. **u/teacher_tales**: As a teacher, I can tell you that the system is broken. We're not paid enough, we're overworked, and we're expected to perform miracles with limited resources. Unions are necessary to fight for our rights and protect us from the system.
7. **u/throwaway123456**: I think we need to focus on the root cause of the problem. Why are teachers underpaid and overworked? It's because of the way we fund education. We need to rethink our priorities and make sure we're investing in our children's education.
8. **u/union_buster**: The root cause of the problem is the union. They're the ones who are holding back education reform and protecting their own interests. We need to get rid of the union and let teachers be held accountable for their performance.
9. **u/teacher_rock**: I think we need to find a balance between protecting teachers and holding them accountable. We need to make sure teachers are well-paid and respected, but we also need to make sure they're performing well and meeting the needs of their students.
10. **u/education_reform**: The problem is that we're not valuing education enough. We need to make education a priority and invest in our schools. Teachers should be paid based on their performance, and we need to hold schools accountable for student outcomes.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my crush [23 F] 1 month, I like my big sister of the fraternity I'm in?

POST: I am in a co-ed fraternity and I got paired up with this girl I didn't know was going to be so amazing. I could talk to her and carry a conversation without having any trouble at all. I feel like she is so easy to talk to about things that I have trouble telling my best girlfriend. She makes me smile, laugh, and just makes me happy when I'm around her. However, she's my fraternity big sister so that could potentially be weird. I know she doesn't like dating within the fraternity but will do it if the right guy comes along. Any advice would be helpful. How can I approach this situation?

TL;DR: I'm in a co-ed fraternity and I have a crush on my big sister, who is 2 years older than me. She's amazing and we have great conversations, but she doesn't like dating within the fraternity. How can I approach this situation without being weird or ruining our friendship?

* "I would say it's a bit weird, but not impossible. Just make sure you're not taking advantage of your position as her little brother. If she's not interested, respect her decision and move on. You don't want to ruin your friendship over something that might not work out." (u/fratlife)

TITLE: Donating land out of Revenge. How will this help my tax returns?

POST: This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. 

A little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  

We discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? 

I want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)

TL;DR: We own 2.3 acres of land in SC, paid property taxes for 20 years, and want to donate/sell it for a reduced price to use as a tax deduction. How does this affect our tax returns and what are some options for donating/selling the land? 

---

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, I think you're on the right track! Donating the land to a non-profit organization like Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands can provide a significant tax deduction. The full market value of the land is indeed deductible, but you'll need to itemize your deductions on your tax return. You can also consider donating the land to a local government or school district, which can also provide a tax deduction. Just make sure to consult with a tax professional to ensure you're taking advantage of the deduction correctly."
* **u/personalfinancepro**: "OP, I agree with u/throwaway123456. Donating the land can provide a significant tax deduction. However, you should also consider the potential long-term benefits of donating the land. For example, if you donate the land to a non-profit organization, you may be able to claim a charitable contribution deduction on your tax return. Additionally, donating the land can also provide a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, knowing that you're making a positive impact on your community."
* **u/neighborlylove**: "OP, I'm glad you're considering donating the land to a good cause! However, I would caution you against using the donation as a way to 'get back' at your neighbors. While it's understandable that you're upset with them, using the donation as a way to'stick it' to them may not be the most effective or respectful way to handle the situation. Instead, consider focusing on the positive impact that the donation can have on your community, and try to find a way to work with your neighbors to find a solution that benefits everyone."
* **u/real estate expert**: "OP, I think you're making a great decision by considering donating the land. However, I would caution you against selling the land at a reduced price. While it may seem like a good idea to get rid of the property quickly, selling it at a reduced price may not be the best use of your investment. Instead, consider working with a real estate agent to find a buyer who is willing to pay a fair price for the property. This will help you get the most value out of your investment and avoid any potential pitfalls."

**Additional Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "OP, just a quick follow-up question. If you decide to donate the land, will you be able to claim the deduction on your tax return even if you're not itemizing your deductions?"
* **u/personalfinancepro**: "OP, yes, you can claim the deduction even if you're not itemizing your deductions. The deduction will be taken as an adjustment to your income, rather than as an itemized deduction."
* **u/neighborlylove**: "OP, I just wanted to add that it's great that you're considering donating the land to a good cause. However, I would caution you against using the donation as a way to 'get back' at your neighbors. Instead, try to focus on the positive impact that the donation can have on your community, and try to find a way to work with your neighbors to find a solution that benefits everyone."

TITLE: I [19 F] chose to date my boyfriend [21 M] over dating my best friend [19 M] and now I'm afraid I made a mistake.

POST: I've had my best friend [19 M] friendzoned for 4 years. We met when I was dating my ex, so I never really saw him as anything more than a friend. He's been there for me for everything. He's basically been in love with me since the moment we met. He would do anything for me if it meant that I would be happy. I never thought that I would have feelings for him like he has for me. That is until a couple months ago.

 I developed feelings for him, while also developing feelings for my current boyfriend, [21 M]. Everyone told me to give my best friend a chance, but I was afraid of losing our friendship in the process, and I had stronger feelings towards my boyfriend. So I told my boyfriend that I would date him, and now my best friend will barely talk to me and wants to kick my boyfriends ass. Also all my friends are mad at me for the decision I made. I regret not giving him a chance, but I feel like if we were to have dated, I should have feelings for only him, and not anyone else. My boyfriend said he would fight my best friend if that's what he really wants, but I don't want them fighting over me. I'm afraid I lost my best friend and made a mistake in not choosing him, now I don't know what to do. Any advice Reddit?

TL;DR: I chose my boyfriend over my best friend who has been in love with me for 4 years. Now my best friend barely talks to me and wants to fight my boyfriend. I regret my decision and don't know what to do.

TITLE: What's the male equivalent of flowers?

POST: Basically, I want to do something sweet and romantic for my boyfriend. Here's the long version: 

According to the weather forecasts, it's going to be a beautiful day today. My boyfriend and I decided to go to a local park we've been meaning to visit for months - the weather just hasn't been nice enough until today. The park's right near a relatively swanky area, and since today's payday and we haven't had a "date night" in a while, we decided to get a pseudofancy dinner afterwards. I'm really looking forward to it. Things haven't always been easy or simple in our relationship, but I think we have a really good foundation and we're really making sure we put time in with each other to maintain it.   

With that in mind, I'd really like to do something special and sweet for him. He's more of a romantic type than I am, so I think he would appreciate it. However, I'm not sure what to do - if the situation were reversed, and I was a boy wanting to surprise a girl, I'd definitely get flowers. But I don't think that'll have the same effect...call me crazy if I'm wrong :) So I was wondering if Reddit could do me a favor and weigh in on what they think the equivalent of flowers are, for a guy. Suggetions are welcome! It's not a special event like an anniversary or anything, just a night out. I'd really love to hear what you have to say on this: I want to surprise him AND get him something (do something for him) he'll really appreciate.   

I know some people are going to respond to this with "sex" or "bj," but if you can help it, please refrain. He's already going to get laid tonight, and probably getting blown for foreplay. I want to do something _besides_ that. (Or on top of that, heh.) Besides, I don't think sex should be a special-occasion-I-love-you surprise. That implies some shitty things about your love life, imo.    

Thanks for reading...please help me out!

TL;DR: I want to do something sweet and romantic for my boyfriend, but I don't know what the male equivalent of flowers is. Help me out, Reddit!

1. "A nice bottle of his favorite whiskey or a craft beer he's been wanting to try. It's a thoughtful gift that shows you pay attention to his interests."
2. "A personalized item, like a monogrammed wallet or watch, shows you put thought into the gift and are willing to invest in him."
3. "Cook his favorite meal or order his favorite takeout. It's a thoughtful gesture that shows you care about his tastes and preferences."
4. "A fun experience, like tickets to a sporting event or a concert, is a great way to create memories and make the night special."
5. "Write him a heartfelt letter or make a video message expressing your feelings and gratitude. It's a personal and meaningful way to show your appreciation."

**Notable comments:**

* "I think the male equivalent of flowers is a nice, thoughtful gesture that shows you're paying attention to his interests and hobbies. It's not about the price tag or the grandeur, but about the thought and effort you put into it."
* "I'm a guy, and I can tell you that the male equivalent of flowers is definitely not a tie or a wallet. It's something that shows you're willing to take risks and be vulnerable with him. Maybe write him a love letter or make him a homemade gift."
* "I think the key is to find something that speaks to his interests and passions. If he's into gaming, get him a new game or a gaming accessory. If he's into music, get him tickets to a concert or a new album by his favorite artist."

TITLE: What is the single funniest moment you've ever experienced?

POST: I have one that stands out from all of the rest.
I was 13; Me and 2 friends were at a minor league baseball game in the mediocre city of Columbia, SC. It was a diabetes benefit game that had rides and games set up out in an open area by left field, which included a bouncey-house thing and an enormous inflatable water slide contraption. At around half time, me and my dickhead friends decided it would be hilarious if we unplugged the bouncey-house while nobody was looking.  Nobody was remotely near it so we figured it would just a quick laugh and nothing dangerous.  My friend J pulled the plug out from a power strip on the ground, and we waited for about 5 minutes for something to happen, but nothing did.  We were just turning to get back to our seats when literally hundreds of parents started screaming and running to the giant waterslide behind us.  It had tipped over on its side and about 30 small children were clinging to the side as it deflated on top of them.  Terrified, we fled the stadium and sat outside.  A firetruck and 2 police cars showed up, so we ran and hid in the woods behind the parking lot.  An hour later, we returned to the stadium and learned that everyone was okay.  I laughed for so long and so hard that I was sore for days after.

TL;DR: Unplugged a bouncey-house at a minor league baseball game, causing a giant waterslide to tip over and 30 small children to cling to it as it deflated on top of them.  We fled, hid in the woods, and laughed for days.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

* "This is the most epic story I've ever read on this subreddit. I'm dying over here!"
* "I'm still laughing at the image of 30 small children clinging to the side of a deflating waterslide. You guys are the ultimate pranksters!"
* "I'm impressed that you guys managed to cause so much chaos and then just ran away and hid in the woods. You're like a real-life version of the Three Stooges!"
* "I'm a little concerned that you guys might have caused some serious injuries or even fatalities. I hope the parents of those kids are okay with the whole situation."
* "This is the kind of story that makes me want to be a bad influence on my friends. You guys are the ultimate troublemakers!"
* "I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that you guys unplugged a bouncey-house and caused a giant waterslide to tip over. That's just insane!"
* "I hope you guys got in trouble for that. You should have been arrested for causing such chaos and putting so many people in danger."
* "This is the kind of story that makes me want to be a kid again. I wish I could have been there to see the look on the parents' faces when the waterslide tipped over."
* "I'm impressed that you guys managed to cause so much chaos and then just laughed about it. You're like a couple of crazy people!"

TITLE: What is the single most ridiculous thing you've ever done?

POST: I'm 25 now, but when I was 19, I decided to try to break the world record for most hamburgers eaten in one sitting. I spent weeks training my stomach by eating massive amounts of food, and I even hired a team of people to help me count the hamburgers as I ate them.

I ended up eating 72 hamburgers in one sitting, which was 12 more than the previous record. I was so proud of myself, but little did I know that the record was actually set by a professional eater, and it was meant to be a joke.

I was on the news, and people were calling me a "hamburger hero." I even got a few sponsorship deals, but it all came crashing down when I got food poisoning from eating so many hamburgers in one sitting.

I ended up in the hospital for three days, and I had to have my stomach pumped. It was a real wake-up call, and I learned that sometimes it's better to just stick to a normal diet.

TITLE: What can you do if your company you paid for your domain name let it lapse just one month after you paid for it?

POST: A bit of back story.  I have been using this company to register my domain and host my site for years.  Its a little site, nothing special, just my home business.  I am really attached to my domain name, so when I returned to school I kept up payments but didn't keep much of a website (just the basic info on some pages, more brags than business)

The company billed me for the hosting automatically.  That reminded me I should update a couple of pages.  It was gone, and it was parked!  I did a whois and found they bought it less than a month after I paid last year for two years.  I did update a couple of pages after I paid last year so it was working for a bit.  

I contacted the company and they were snarky.  They said that the CC payment hadn't gone through on the 24th of may.. which was true, for some reason the CC company thought using the CC online was suspicious, due to the fact it had never been used for that before.  It was cleared up and worked the next day.  I pointed out to them that the second payment had gone through.  Got a snarky reply that I had no idea what I was talking about and I must not have got the "it didn't work email"

So the CC was contacted and provided a statement for that month, which clearly shows the payment went through and was charged to the account.  Armed with this knowledge I emailed them back saying I had the statement, and would a scan do or did they need it mailed to them.

That was 2 weeks ago.  What should I (can I) do?  I am just so bummed I really liked that domain name.

TL;DR: Company let my domain name lapse, bought it, and won't give it back.  They claim the CC payment didn't go through, but I have a statement showing it did.  What can I do?

TITLE: I (27/F) fooled around with a boy(25) that I like, but just met two weeks ago - do we talk about it?

POST: My roommate introduced me to his newest coworker about two weeks ago, and he's become a regular visitor and occasional overnight guest at the house ever since. We get along pretty well, and I think he's really cute. Definitely someone I would love to have in my life in some manner or another. I feel as though he's everything I've been wanting in a guy, but it's also a little early to make that call. Perhaps it's just the loneliness talking. We haven't spent much time with just the two of us.

Anyway, we're all kind of transient in our living situation at the moment - he's camping and I'm sharing an RV with my two roommates (a couple). It was snowy a few nights ago, so he crashed with us. I offered to share the couch bed so he didn't have to sleep on the floor (really just a ploy to cuddle). 

Well, I was just planning on cuddling, but the next thing I know he's slyly moving his arm around my waist, and hinted for me to make a move. I didn't object. One thing leads to another and we end up fooling around. 

It was great, and I'd totally do it again. I want to have this kid in some way, be it FWB, casual dating, or a long term relationship. Thing is, neither of us have mentioned it yet, and I'm not sure if I should? We've just been carrying on like nothing ever went down, but I'm afraid if it doesn't get brought up, I'll miss my opportunity. I also can't really read how he's feeling about it. 

What the hell do I say to him? Anything? Suggest we do it again? Send him a sexy text message? Keep quiet and wait for him? I'm bad at boys.

TL;DR: I fooled around with a guy I like, but just met two weeks ago. We haven't talked about it. Should I say something, or just keep quiet and wait for him to make a move?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not a big deal if you don't bring it up. If he's interested in you, he'll make a move. If not, you can always have a casual thing going on. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not feel the same way." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about it. It's not fair to leave him wondering how you feel. You can say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the other night. I had a really great time and I was wondering if you did too?' It's a good way to gauge his feelings and see if there's a possibility of something more." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I would suggest sending him a flirtatious text message, but not too overtly. Something like 'Hey, I was thinking about the other night and I had a really great time. Would love to do it again sometime.' It's a good way to keep the conversation light and see if he's interested in pursuing something more." (u/flirtygirl)
* "I think you should just be honest with him. Tell him how you feel and what you're looking for. If he's not interested, then at least you know and can move on. But if he is interested, then you can start building something together. Just remember to be respectful of his feelings and boundaries." (u/honestyisthebestpolicy)
* "I would say something like 'Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the other night. I had a really great time and I was wondering if you felt the same way. If not, no big deal, but if you did, maybe we could explore something more?' It's a good way to gauge his feelings and see if there's a possibility of something more." (u/relationshipadvice)

TITLE: My 10 year wedding anniversary is coming up and, unfortunately, we'll be totally unable to have any sort of real celebration. What can I do?

POST: So, long story short, we've been together more than 15 years, married for 10, no kids yet, and we love to travel. We've always traveled kind of thriftily, but I was planning a 10 Year Balls-to-the-Wall something or other until we got a little bad news: she needs back surgery, and she needs it fairly quickly. I started working to move my plans up on the calendar, no matter what the changes cost me, but then I found out that she's on strict orders not to travel while awaiting surgery. FML.

Her recovery time will be a small number of months, but in the mean time I'd like to commemorate the date with something a little more special than a really nice dinner, etc. To make matters more complicated, the surgery is only a few days after our anniversary date and it's happening in another city (Houston), so we'll be several hundred miles from most of our friends and all of our family except for her parents.

And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've looked into getting some of our friends to come down and have some sort of a party, but I couldn't get anywhere with that for a variety of reasons (not least of which was the aforementioned hundreds of miles of travel). I've rescheduled our whirlwind trip for as soon as she can reasonably be expected to be capable of travel, but that won't be for several months.

What can I do?

TL;DR: My wife needs back surgery, we can't travel, and our 10 year anniversary is coming up. What can I do to make it special?

TITLE: My [21 M] boyfriend and I [20 F] have been dealing with alcohol/cheating related issues...

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for around 7 months now....it's pretty serious and we're really in love. I can't imagine being with anyone besides him. We get along beautifully and he always knows how to make me feel better. 

However, the first two weeks of school, one when I was here and one when I wasn't, my boyfriend got so incredibly black out drunk and cheated on me twice.
He has a history of alcoholism in his family and he has always been a heavy drinker, so his blacking out is not uncommon.
In the first instance he was at school a week before it started so he was just partying. He got so drunk that a girl who raped him last year (before we were together) I guess found him again and the same situation played out. They had sex but he really didn't remember until this past week. 
The other situation was him being blackout when I stayed in and his phone died so he couldn't answer my messages or calls and he called me at 4 AM from the floor of his apartment looking for me asking me where he had been all night and I, of course, couldn't answer. Turns out he had seen his ex girlfriend and she gave him a blowjob.
It honestly disgusts me so much that that happened but I have always chalked it up to his drinking. He's getting better with it, but now it just causes all of our fights because he is so ridiculous when he drinks.

I am not sure what to do....

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 7 months has cheated on me twice while blacked out due to his history of alcoholism. I'm torn between being angry and hurt, but also understanding that he's struggling with his addiction. What should I do?

---

TITLE: Help with bringing a pseudo-outdoor cat indoors?

POST: This cat currently lives on our front porch as our outdoor cat, we acquired him pretty recently. He was abandoned by a neighbor's brother, and has more than likely only been an outdoor cat for a few months. He wants to come inside desperately, and we want to let him inside. He's fully clawed, so we're worried he might tear the place up, and also wondering if he'd take to a litterbox. We could always get him declawed, but the housetraining thing is my real concern. He's extremely friendly and obviously very accustomed to people, and has always been very well-behaved when we let him indoors to warm up (winter is approaching in my neck of the woods). Any thoughts or tips?

TL;DR: We want to bring our pseudo-outdoor cat indoors, but worried about him tearing up the place and housetraining him. He's friendly, well-behaved, and accustomed to people. Any advice?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/CatLady99**: "I've brought in several outdoor cats over the years and it's always a process. First, make sure you're prepared for the destruction that might ensue. Cover your furniture, move breakables to high shelves, and set up a safe room for him to acclimate to indoors. As for housetraining, it's not impossible, but it will take time and patience. Start by setting up a litterbox in a quiet area and encouraging him to use it by placing him in it after meals or playtime. Reward him with treats when he uses it correctly. Declawing is a last resort, in my opinion. It's a major surgery and can lead to arthritis and other issues. Instead, consider using scratching posts and pads to redirect his scratching behavior."
2. **u/FelineFanatic**: "I agree with CatLady99. It's essential to prepare for the transition and be patient. Outdoor cats often have a strong instinct to scratch and mark their territory, so it's crucial to provide plenty of scratching options and keep an eye on him during the initial adjustment period. As for housetraining, it's a process that requires consistency, positive reinforcement, and patience. You can try placing him in the litterbox after meals or playtime, and reward him with treats when he uses it correctly. It might take some time, but with persistence and patience, he'll learn to use the litterbox."
3. **u/PurrfectPaws**: "I've had success with using a 'catio' or a screened-in porch to help outdoor cats transition to indoors. It allows them to get used to the sights, sounds, and smells of the indoors while still having some freedom. You can also try setting up a'safe room' or a quiet area where he can acclimate to the indoors without feeling overwhelmed. As for housetraining, it's essential to establish a routine and stick to it. Place him in the litterbox after meals or playtime, and reward him with treats when he uses it correctly. It might take some time, but with consistency and patience, he'll learn to use the litterbox."
4. **u/WhiskerWizard**: "I agree with the previous comments. It's essential to prepare for the transition and be patient.

TITLE: I [23 F] am still thinking about my ex-boyfriend [23 M] of 5 years almost everyday. How can I move on?

POST: My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me in early April. It came out of left field for me but apparently he hadn't been feeling the same about me for a while. There were no signs as far as I could tell, everything seemed normal. We had even hung out the previous weekend and everything was fine. Maybe I was missing the signs.

Anyway, since then I have not been able to stop thinking about him almost every single day. I'm not depressed or unable to enjoy life (surprisingly since i've battled depression and anxiety in the past) and am even having some really awesome things happen in my life. But he's always in the back of my head. I think the way he broke up with me really messed with me. I'm mostly confused and disappointed as to why and how he ended things.  

His explanation was all over the place and although we met a week after he broke up with me to clear things up, I still have a ton of questions that I feel deserve answers. 

My question is, is it best to just continue what I'm doing which is focusing on other things like work, family, friends, myself, etc.? Or should I try to contact him to get a better explanation of what went wrong?

We had said we would try to remain friends but we both needed time and agreed that when we were ready we would contact the other person.

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me suddenly and I'm still thinking about him almost every day. I'm not depressed but I'm confused and disappointed. Should I continue focusing on other things or try to contact him to get a better explanation of what went wrong?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's great that you're focusing on other things and not letting the breakup consume you. It's normal to still think about him, but it sounds like you're doing a great job of not letting it define your life. I would say don't contact him right now. You need time to process and heal. When you're ready, you can try to reach out and see if he's willing to have a conversation. But for now, just keep doing what you're doing and remember that you're strong and capable."
* "I think it's great that you're trying to move on and focus on other things. However, I do think it's important to have closure. If you're still thinking about him and wondering what went wrong, it might be worth reaching out to him and having a conversation. Just be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to have that conversation or that it might not give you the closure you're looking for. But it's worth a shot, right?"
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's tough to move on from a long-term relationship, especially when it was sudden. I think it's great that you're focusing on other things, but I also think it's okay to acknowledge your feelings and not try to suppress them. Maybe try journaling or talking to a therapist about your feelings? It might help you process and work through them. And yeah, it's probably best to wait a bit before reaching out to him. You need time to heal and figure out what you want for yourself."
* "I think it's great that you're focusing on other things, but I also think it's important to acknowledge that it's okay to still think about him. It's normal to have feelings and memories from the relationship. Maybe try to find ways to honor those feelings and memories in a healthy way, like writing in a journal or creating a memory book. And yeah, it's probably best to wait a bit before reaching out to him. You need time to figure out what you want for yourself and what kind of relationship you want in the future."

Overall, the comments are supportive and encouraging, with some people suggesting that the OP focus on other things and not contact her ex-boyfriend right now, while others think it's okay to reach out and try to get closure. Some people also suggest that the OP try to process her feelings through journaling or talking to a therapist. The comments are generally helpful and non-judgmental, with a focus on supporting the OP as she navigates her emotions and moves forward.

TITLE: My [22F] recent ex [23M] of 3 year relationship suddenly has an attitude about moving out. I am so uncomfortable. What should I do?

POST: My boyfriend of 3 years was blatantly ignoring me and apathetic and I decided to break up with him because I was the only one putting effort into keeping the relationship together. He hurt me (flirting with exes, lying, trying to berate me) way too often and enough was enough. We live together, but he said he would be the one to move out since I'm recovering from an injury and I have fish that would be a pain to move. I told him I want to cut ties and I do not want to talk to him anymore. I do not want to be his friend.

I have heard him sobbing in the other room almost every night since the breakup. We have exchanged some letters but his letters don't make sense. He keeps saying he loves me and he doesn't know what he wants... That his emotions say he's "making a continuous mistake" but he is trying to be rational and needs space. He doesn't seem to accept the reality that I am DONE. It's over. I'm ready to move on. I feel like I don't love him anymore. 

Tonight I confronted him because my alternative plan fell through. He said that moving out was not a priority for him. He was very cold about it and seemed to be putting on an act. Is he trying to get in a last ounce of control? 

What are my options? I live in a city where it is hard to find decent rent prices. My cousin agreed to move in with me here, but my ex doesn't seem to want to leave. I need to give my landlord 30 days notice before leaving. I feel like I should just give her the notice tonight and abandon the apartment and just settle wherever I end up. I could squeeze into a studio but I'm a student and would be paying way more than I am now. I might reach out to my family to help fund an apartment by myself.

What should I do?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend of 3 years is being super clingy and won't move out after breakup. I'm uncomfortable and unsure of what to do. Should I give my landlord notice and move out ASAP or try to find a new place to live?

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you deserve so much better than someone who can't respect your boundaries. Don't worry about the apartment, focus on yourself and your own well-being. You can always find a new place to live, but you can't get back the emotional energy you've wasted on someone who doesn't appreciate you."
* "I would give your landlord notice and start looking for a new place to live. You don't owe your ex anything, and you shouldn't have to deal with his drama anymore. You're a strong, capable person, and you can handle this."
* "Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? It sounds like you're still reeling from the breakup and dealing with a lot of emotional baggage. A professional can help you process your feelings and develop a plan for moving forward."
* "I would try to find a new place to live, but also consider talking to your ex about his behavior. It's not okay for him to be so clingy and controlling, and he needs to understand that you deserve better. Maybe a calm, rational conversation can help him see things from your perspective."
* "Girl, you're not alone. I went through something similar with my ex, and it was hell. But I came out stronger on the other side, and you will too. Just remember that you're worth it, and you deserve to be happy."

TITLE: I (20f) am having a hard time coping with my baggage

POST: I have the greatest boyfriend (19m) in the world right now. He is thoughtful, kind, he does everything in the world to make me feel important and special and I try to do the same for him. We have been together for about eight months now.

However right around the time we met I was exiting a really bad relationship that ended in me terminating a pregnancy. My current SO knows that that happened, and accepts me for who I am now, which given my past might be more then I deserve. On top of that from about feb-mid april my hormones were really nuts causing me to just be what felt like a shadow of who I was, but after some recent medication I feel a million times better.

I suppose my problem is that a part of me wants to run away from this relationship because I think I might have jumped into it too soon. But I know I truly love my SO and I'm afraid if I tell him what I'm feeling he will take it the wrong way and it will hurt him. I know that communicating what I'm feeling would be the best thing for us, but I just don't know how to have that conversation.

TL;DR: I'm having a hard time coping with my baggage and I'm afraid of hurting my SO if I tell him how I'm feeling.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're struggling with your feelings. I think it's great that you're considering having an open and honest conversation with your SO. It might be scary, but it's the best way to work through your feelings and strengthen your relationship.

One thing that might help is to think about what you're really afraid of. Is it that your SO will leave you, or is it that he'll be disappointed in you? Once you identify what's driving your fear, you can start to address it and work on building trust with each other.

Remember that your SO loves you for who you are, baggage and all. He's already shown that by accepting you and being supportive. If you're willing to be open and honest with him, I'm sure he'll be willing to listen and work through this with you.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough to know how to navigate. One thing that might help is to write down your feelings and concerns before talking to your SO. Sometimes putting your thoughts into words can help clarify things and make it easier to communicate.

Also, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you happy. It's easy to get caught up in our own worries and fears, but it's important to remember that your SO loves and accepts you for who you are.

When you do have the conversation with your SO, try to use "I" statements instead of "you" statements. This can help avoid blame and defensiveness, and can make it easier to have a constructive conversation.

Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's normal to feel uncertain or scared. But by being open and honest with each other, you can work through this and come out even stronger on the other side.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I just wanted to say that you're not alone in feeling this way. I've been in similar situations before and it's tough to know how to navigate. But I want to encourage you to take a deep breath and remember that your SO loves and accepts you for who you are.

It's okay to take your time and think about what you want to say before having the conversation with your SO. But don't let fear hold you back from communicating your feelings. Remember that your SO wants to support you and be there for you, and that includes working through tough emotions together.

When you do have the conversation, try to focus on your feelings and concerns rather than blaming or accusing your SO. Use "I" statements and try to be specific about what's bothering you. And remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's normal to feel uncertain or scared.

You got this, OP! You're strong and capable, and you can get through this. Just remember to be kind to yourself and to communicate openly and honestly with your SO. Good luck!

TITLE: Me [20M] with my GF[20F] When would you stay with crazy?

POST: I'll try to keep it somewhat brief. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. Once we were dating for awhile I realized she wasn't the most stable person... at all. She had very bad depression, anxiety, and migraines. She also gets jealous easily, has trust issues, and is slightly overweight. It took me a long time and a lot of effort to get her to go to her doctor to start taking meds. I tried to get her to see a therapist as well, but she only ended up going a few times and then gave up. When we were in college together still, her depression/anxiety was so bad that she gave up on going to classes and flunked out. She doesn't have her license, she currently works a minimum wage job and it's been 1-2 years since she's been in college. She was supposed to go last spring but that didn't work out, and she's supposed to go an upcoming semester but I'm not sure if she'll follow through. Her family is also pretty crazy which doesn't help the whole situation.

---

I see many people give the advice of leaving someone who seems depressed or has anxiety because "they're crazy." I don't really see these people as crazy unless it's a serious case and they're doing extremely immature, insane things. To me, it seems a little rude to just assume they're crazy and tell people to run away. For whatever reason I decided to stay and help her instead of running away. She's definitely improved a lot, but still has some issues. I guess I cared about her enough to spend a lot of my time and energy to stay and help. My question to you is: When would you stay with "crazy"? What would make you stay, what would make you leave?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a girl who has depression, anxiety, and other issues. She's improved a lot since I've been helping her, but still has some issues. I'm wondering when people would stay with someone who has these kinds of problems and what would make them leave.

TITLE: **A personal finance tax, income, and asset brain teaser**

POST: Surveying /r/personalfinance for possible creative solutions or interesting perspectives on a unique situation. 

The subject is a 62 year old widow. Here are the measurables:
*Assets*: $800,000 in real estate. A primary and secondary residence of approximately equal value. Approx $1,200,000 in relatively liquid assets, roughly $700,000 of which are in tax-deferred accounts. 

*Income*
*~85,000 (before taxes)

*Expenses*
Subject makes an approximately $1,200 contribution to a tax deferred account each month, but otherwise spends almost all or most of her income to maintain the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. This includes upkeep of both properties, travel, and general enjoyment.  It is unlikely that a change in lifestyle is possible. The vacation property is rented on occasion. 

Here is where it gets interesting: Subject has approximately **$400,000** in a tax loss carry forward.  Subject's investments have not been performing terribly well as of late and subject does not have much in the way of capital gains to offset the tax-loss carry forward. Additionally, Most of subjects liquid assets are in tax deferred accounts.  Subject has about $570,000 in a taxable account. 

Subject would need to realize an approximately 80% gain in the taxable account to use up all of the tax loss (in addition, $3,000 each year of the tax loss can be applied to ordinary income). 

**Questions**
1) How can subject position herself to make the best use of her tax loss?

TITLE: [M/18]Should he really be mad about what I[F/18] just asked about?

POST: My bf and I have been together 2 years. We are currently in a LDR and he is in Hawaii but possibly moving back soon. Haven't seen him in 3 months. 

This isn't even a big deal. Of course I get jealous of him talking to other pretty girls...but really, who doesn't? 

So, I was on Facebook and it constantly pops up on my newsfeed that he is liking all these other pictures of these girls he is friends with. (Note: most of his friends are girls. He has always been that way AND he has had huge crushes on all of them at one point in time before we started dating.) And I was a little jealous because I want more attention from him. So, out of curiosity, I asked about it. At first he said he didn't like any pictures. But then he said his brother does it most of the time.(His brother goes on his account often) Then he got really pissed at me over it. I didn't even sound mad about it. I kinda made a joke out of it when I asked. It's just frustrating because now he won't talk to me.

TL;DR: BF got mad at me for asking about him liking pictures of other girls on Facebook. He said his brother does it, but still got upset. Now he won't talk to me.

---

**Community Response:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend is being super petty and controlling. He's not even giving you a valid reason for getting mad. You were just curious and made a joke out of it. If he can't handle a little bit of jealousy, then maybe he's not the right guy for you."
* **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think your boyfriend is being ridiculous. You're right, who doesn't get a little jealous when they see their partner interacting with other people? It's normal. And it sounds like he's not even giving you a straight answer about what's going on. You deserve better than someone who can't communicate with you honestly."
* **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I think there's more to this story than you're letting on. Why did you feel the need to ask about it in the first place? Were you really just curious, or was there something else going on? And why did he get so mad if it was just his brother liking pictures? There might be some underlying issues here that need to be addressed."
* **u/love_is_a_choice**: "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. If your boyfriend can't handle a little bit of jealousy and gets mad at you for asking questions, then maybe he's not the right guy for you. You deserve someone who can communicate with you openly and honestly, and who can handle your feelings without getting defensive."

**Conclusion:**

The community is divided on this issue, with some people siding with the OP and others suggesting that there might be more to the story. Some people think that the boyfriend is being petty and controlling, while others think that the OP might be overreacting or that there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to stay in the relationship is up to the OP, but it's clear that there are some serious communication issues that need to be worked out.

TITLE: Job change question

POST: Hello everyone, I hope that you guys can give me some guidance on an important decision I have to make. I have been working for 11 months at a big accounting firm. My background is in IT and wanted to do something more closely related to technology. I started interviewing and I received an offer for $7K more than what I am currently making. This came as great news, except I just learned that HR is going to get me an opportunity within my current firm to do something a lot cooler but I'd keep the same salary. The problem with the new offer is the distance to my current place and where my SO lives. I live currently close to Downtown and she lives 30 minutes south, the new job would be 40 minutes north west of where I currently live. Just before I got the offer I was looking to move closer to her, but that would mean about 1.5 hrs of driving every day. I have made numbers and the raise covers the price of gas. Is there anything I should do in addition to that to be able to make a better decision? I feel like if I stay at my current firm I'll be able to get an even bigger raise if I move out in the next few years, but not sure that this is the case. I'm confident since unemployment numbers are steadily going down every day. What would you do?

TL;DR: I have a job offer for $7K more than my current salary, but it's 40 minutes away from my current place and my SO's place. I also have an opportunity within my current firm to do something cooler, but keep the same salary. What should I do?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I would weigh the pros and cons of each option. Consider the commute time, cost of living in the new area, and how it will affect your relationship with your SO. Also, think about the potential for future raises at your current firm. If you're happy with the new job offer, it might be worth considering the commute. But if you're not, it might be better to stay at your current firm and look for other opportunities that are closer to your SO."
2. **financialfreedom**: "I would crunch some numbers to see how much the commute will cost you in terms of time and money. Consider the cost of gas, tolls, and wear and tear on your car. Also, think about the impact on your relationship with your SO. If the commute is going to be a significant burden, it might be worth considering the opportunity within your current firm. On the other hand, if the raise is significant enough to offset the costs, it might be worth considering the new job."
3. **carefulplanner**: "I would also consider the long-term implications of each option. If you take the new job, will you be able to advance in your career? Will you have opportunities for professional development? On the other hand, if you stay at your current firm, will you be able to continue to grow and develop as a professional? Think about what's most important to you and make a decision based on that."
4. **jobsearcher**: "I would also consider the job market in the area where the new job is located. Is it a growing industry? Are there opportunities for advancement? On the other hand, if you stay at your current firm, are there opportunities for growth and development? Think about what's most important to you and make a decision based on that."
5. **happyinvestor**: "I would also consider the impact on your overall happiness and well-being. Think about how the commute will affect your daily routine and your relationship with your SO. If the new job is going to cause you significant stress and unhappiness, it might be worth considering the opportunity within your current firm. On the other hand, if the raise is significant enough to offset the costs, it might be worth considering the new job."

TITLE: I've only ever liked 1 girl, and i can't get over her?

POST: Hi. I'm 23, male.

I knew her since i was like 14, she was a year younger than me. We used to hang out almost daily for years - she lived just down the road from me. We were really good friends, and our friendship lasted until i was about 19. I was a really naive teen, and never realized she had feelings for me, even though she gave some massive signals. 

I had strong emotional feelings for her too, but i didn't really understand them at the time. I was a late bloomer. I went through a lot of hardships  and i slipped into a bit of a destructive state. I ended up pushing her away, i did it to protect her, but it ruined our friendship. I imagine she hates me now. 

I've only seen her once since (been 5 years), and we both completely blanked each other. I haven't attempted to contact her or anything, i could quite easily, but i don't want to talk to her and find out she hates me now. I still think about her a fair bit, and even have dreams about her. (non sexual). I know it's weird, but i'm not stalking her or involving her in any way so it's not hurting, right? 

Well, that's the past. The present is the problem. I don't feel attracted to anybody, sexually or emotionally. I have options, i'm not bad looking and i get interest on nights out, and a couple of friends who like me. But none of them interest me. 

I know this is really pathetic, but i don't know what to do. I want to get over her, but i still have the problem of not finding anyone else attractive. I've only slept with one girl ever, and weirdly, she looked a lot like the girl i liked. Still the sex was no more enjoyable than masturbating, and was all very average.

TL;DR: I've had a crush on a girl since i was 14, and it's still going strong. I pushed her away, and we haven't spoken in 5 years. I don't feel attracted to anyone else, and it's really affecting my life. I want to get over her, but i don't know how.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're 23 and you're still hung up on someone from your teenage years? That's not healthy. You need to focus on moving on and finding someone new. It's okay to take time to get over someone, but 5 years is a long time."
* "I feel you, bro. I had a crush on someone for years and it was really hard to get over. But you can't keep dwelling on the past. You need to start living in the present and focus on your future. Maybe try talking to a therapist or something?"
* "I think you're being really unfair to yourself. You're not a bad person for having feelings for someone. It's okay to have regrets, but you can't keep beating yourself up over it. Maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your life and move forward?"
* "I think you're being really selfish. You pushed her away and now you're expecting her to just forgive you and move on? That's not how it works. You need to take responsibility for your actions and try to make amends."
* "I think you're being really dramatic. It's just a crush, dude. It's not the end of the world. You'll find someone else who likes you and you'll move on. Stop worrying about it so much."
* "I think you're being really honest and vulnerable. It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings like that. I hope you find someone who understands and supports you."
* "I think you're being really unrealistic. You're expecting to find someone who looks exactly like the girl you liked and has the same personality? That's not going to happen. You need to focus on finding someone who is a good match for you, not just someone who looks like someone else."
* "I think you're being really silly. You're not going to find someone who is perfect, no one is. You need to focus on finding someone who is a good match for you and who makes you happy. Stop worrying about what others think and just be yourself."

TITLE: Am I an asshole or wrong to stay friend with my straight best friend of 4 years (22M) if I'm (21M) gay?

POST: I'm gay. Just came out. I'm 22. My best friend for years has been a straight guy.

I don't let my orientation define me. I hate saying I'm gay. But I always think about this. 

I've crushed on him since the day I've met him. I've just dealt with it since he means a lot as a friend. Usually I don't associate with crushes for the heartache. But this time I am. 

I feel bad because no matter how much I try not to its just biology that my feelings for him will change how I act as a friend. I'm naturally just gonna feel a bit different around him because of the attraction. 

We tell each other everything. Our relationship is reciprocal. We hang out. Text every day. Make sure we see each other when we both busy. We share feelings. He talks about his girlfriends with me, etc. I try to protect him and be a friend and he protects me too, but I can't help but feel like I wish I could have him. I don't let those feelings change how I act though. 

He knows I'm gay and doesn't care. He knew a year ago before I told anyone. 

I just feel like an asshole if I'm going to try to find a boyfriend but in my head I love another guy I still see and talk to all the time. 

I always make male friends. I like them more. But I always crush on them eventually. I have a lot of love. I feel like this is wrong too.

I get told its weird, cheating, wrong, etc. And I get told to find new friends and a real boyfriend. 

I feel like I'm doing something really wrong and that our relationship is extremely weird compared to most other peoples friends.

TL;DR: I'm gay, I've had a straight best friend for 4 years, I've had feelings for him since day one, but I've been trying to keep it professional. I feel like an asshole for staying friends with him while I'm looking for a boyfriend. I feel like our relationship is weird compared to others.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're not an asshole. You're just human. It's normal to have feelings for someone, even if it's a friend. The fact that you're trying to keep it professional and not act on those feelings is what matters. You're not doing anything wrong."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not cheating on him or leading him on. You're just having feelings. And who knows, maybe he feels the same way but hasn't acted on it. The important thing is that you're being honest with yourself and him."
* "I think you should focus on finding someone who makes you feel the same way you do about your straight friend. Maybe someone who shares your interests and values. That way, you can have a healthy and fulfilling relationship without feeling guilty or weird."
* "I don't think it's weird at all. You're just being honest with yourself and your feelings. That takes a lot of courage. I think you should keep being friends with him and see where things go. You never know, maybe something will develop between you two."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your friendship. Are you staying friends with him because you genuinely care about him, or are you staying friends with him because you're afraid to lose him? If it's the latter, then maybe it's time to re-prioritize your relationships and focus on people who make you feel good about yourself."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and understanding. Many people acknowledge that it's normal to have feelings for someone, even if it's a friend, and that the important thing is that you're being honest with yourself and your friend. Some people suggest finding someone who shares your interests and values, while others think it's okay to keep being friends with your straight friend and see where things go. Overall, the community is encouraging you to be true to yourself and your feelings, and not to beat yourself up over something that's natural and normal.

TITLE: My boyfriend wants to hang out with someone he used to have a crush on.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost six years, and we're in college now. When he was a junior in high school (we had been together for 3 years around this time), he developed a crush on a girl in his class. He liked her for a while, and didn't tell me until 6 months later, when he was "kind of getting over it." It's been years, and he hasn't really spoken to her, but today she IMs him out of nowhere and asks him to go with her to get her tattoo. He accepted and then told me about it. Although she is not into men, this has caused me some distress. Am I being paranoid?

TL;DR: My boyfriend had a crush on someone in high school, and she just asked him to get a tattoo with her. He accepted and told me about it. I'm feeling uneasy.

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's not about you being paranoid, it's about your boyfriend's decision to hang out with someone who has a history with him. If he's not interested in rekindling anything, he should've told her no. It's not about you, it's about respecting your relationship."
2. **u/Redditor99**: "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. It's just a tattoo, and it's not like they're going on a date or anything. If your boyfriend is comfortable with it, then maybe you should be too."
3. **u/SkepticalSally**: "I'm not saying you're being paranoid, but it's definitely worth having a conversation with your boyfriend about. Ask him why he accepted and what he's hoping to get out of this 'hangout.' Make sure you're both on the same page."
4. **u/ConcernedCitizen**: "I think you should be worried. If your boyfriend is still thinking about someone from his past, it's a sign that he might not be fully invested in your relationship. You deserve better than someone who's still got feelings for someone else."
5. **u/RealisticRuth**: "It's not about being paranoid, it's about being realistic. Your boyfriend's past is his past, but it's still a part of him. You need to decide if you're comfortable with him having a connection with someone from his past, even if it's just a tattoo. Communication is key here."

**Discussion:**

The post sparks a lively discussion about the boundaries of relationships, trust, and communication. Some commenters argue that the boyfriend's decision to hang out with someone from his past is harmless and that the OP is being too sensitive. Others suggest that the boyfriend's actions could be a sign of lingering feelings or a lack of commitment to the current relationship.

The conversation highlights the importance of open communication in relationships, encouraging the OP to have a conversation with her boyfriend about his intentions and feelings. Some commenters also emphasize the need for the OP to consider her own feelings and boundaries, and to decide whether she is comfortable with her boyfriend having a connection with someone from his past.

The post and its comments demonstrate the complexities of relationships and the challenges of navigating past relationships, crushes, and feelings. Ultimately, the discussion encourages readers to prioritize honesty, communication, and mutual respect in their own relationships.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my GF [25 F], duration 9 months, girlfriend is hanging out with a guy who likes her and it's making me really jealous

POST: My girlfriend (25) and I (28) started going out about 9 months ago. We moved in together after about a month or so and it didn't work out. We broke up after about 6 months because neither of us were happy. About a month after we broke up we started hanging out again and found that we both still really cared for each other and became FwB. After a couple of those sessions we had a talk about what we were doing and how we were feeling. Long story short we decided that we wanted to make the relationship work and to take it slow. We also told each other the people that we had hooked up with while we were on break so to be completely honest with each other. 

One guy she hooked up with really liked her and asked her out. They knew each other through work and initially she thought he was gay (this was when we were dating the first time). 

Fast forward to last night she told me that he'd called around 8.30 and they'd spoken on the phone for about 90 minutes, mostly about work, some about me and some about other stuff. I have been really unsettled by this since she told me. She called and we talked about it on the phone but I still can't shake this feeling of jealousy. Thoughts?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been together for 9 months, broke up for a bit, got back together, and now she's hanging out with a guy who likes her and it's making me really jealous.

TITLE: Me [23M] and my SO [21F] are having issues because of her sister [23F].

POST: Basically my GF and I are fighting because her sister does not want her to move to the city that I live in. My GF wants to pursue school and her sister is trying to make her stay at their hometown.

She insists that her sister is limiting her opportunities, which for her is becoming a celebrity in anyway possible, and that going to school will end it. Of course this makes me rage because I and my GF believe that school would be a better option.

I am not sure what to do because I am trying to respect her sister. But I am on the verge of raging and telling her what I really think. She tries to pursue unrealistic dreams by basically selling herself to 60 year old millionaires.

TL;DR: My GF's sister is trying to hold her back from pursuing school and I am getting frustrated because I think it's a better option. I don't know what to do because I want to respect her sister but I also want to support my GF.

This post is an example of a common issue that many people face in their relationships, particularly when there are family members involved. The OP (original poster) is struggling to navigate the complex emotions and opinions of his girlfriend, her sister, and his own feelings on the matter.

The post highlights several key issues:

1. **Family dynamics**: The sister's influence is causing tension in the relationship, and the OP is unsure how to handle it.
2. **Conflict of values**: The OP and his girlfriend have different opinions on what is best for her, which is causing friction.
3. **Respect and boundaries**: The OP wants to respect his girlfriend's sister, but he also wants to support his girlfriend and express his own opinions.

To address these issues, the OP could consider the following strategies:

1. **Open communication**: Have an open and honest conversation with his girlfriend about his concerns and feelings. Listen to her perspective and try to understand her sister's motivations.
2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries and expectations for how he wants to handle the situation. This could include setting limits on how much he engages with her sister or how much he participates in discussions about her sister's opinions.
3. **Seek mediation**: Consider seeking mediation from a trusted friend, family member, or therapist to help resolve the conflict and find a mutually beneficial solution.
4. **Support his girlfriend**: Continue to support his girlfriend's goals and aspirations, even if they differ from his own. Encourage her to pursue her passions and interests, while also being mindful of her sister's influence.

Ultimately, the OP's goal should be to find a solution that respects his girlfriend's autonomy, her sister's opinions, and his own values and boundaries. By communicating openly and seeking support, he can work towards a resolution that strengthens his relationship with his girlfriend and helps them navigate the challenges of family dynamics.

TITLE: (FL) Cashier won't do her job properly. I want to fire her but HR says no because of religious reasons.

POST: Hi, legaladvice. I can't believe I'm in this situation.

I was recently promoted to Store Manager of a grocery store after the original manager quit (I was assisstant manager before for about 6 months).

We hired a woman, let's call her Sally, a couple of weeks ago. She's not terrible at her job (just basic cashier stuff) but she refuses to process payments that equal $6.66. I know, it sounds crazy.

Our store prices everything ending in 28 cents as a ploy (kinda like Brandsmart). So anything priced at $6.28 will ring up to $6.66 after tax, and it happens quite often that people will buy just that one item (which I've learned after Sally started working here).

Every time this happens, one of the managers or supervisors has to take over because she refuses and sometimes it throws a spanner in the works. I brought it up with HR and they said I can't do anything about it because it's her religious freedom (since 666 is the number of the beast in Christianity).

The thing is, we have the same religion; we even go to the same church! But I don't think she should be able to use that excuse to not ring those transactions. I've offered to move her to another part of the store but she doesn't want to stock or do anything else.

HR warned me not to decrease her hours or I'd get in trouble, but I just don't see how I can do my job properly if I have to take care of petty stuff like this.

Is there a law or something that says I'm right? I don't want to go back to HR without knowing I'm 100% right that she shouldn't have the job if she can't perform all aspects of it.

And if I'm wrong, I suppose I can bear it even if I do think it's ridiculous.

TL;DR: Cashier won't ring up transactions with $6.66 due to religious reasons. HR says I can't do anything about it. I think it's ridiculous and want to know if I'm right.

TITLE: Should I (23/f) leave the man I love (27/m) to take my dream job halfway around the world?

POST: So I have just under 48 hours to make a decision that could forever alter the course of my life.

I've been offered a financially lucrative position in a beautiful country that I believe I could enjoy living in. Personally, things aren't so great at home, so were it not for my boyfriend, I would be jumping at the offer.

I've been in an on-again/off-again relationship for four years. He was my first kiss, first everything. I fell hard and never really got back up. We recently decided to try dating again after about a year of pretty much dating without the label.... however, I don't think a relationship (not just with me, with anyone) is what he wants. I think I pressured him into it.

So I have this offer. This dream job. But on the other hand, I have a chance at stability and finally being with the man I love more than my own life. I've never lived in a foreign country and honestly the thought terrifies me. But... what if I stay here? What if the relationship doesn't work out and I'm left here wondering.... what if? for the rest of my life? What if I move and, again, I'm wondering what if? but this time about the relationship?

I really just don't know what to do. I'm so torn. I can't eat or sleep, it's almost some sort of cosmic joke. Why would this offer come right when I have a chance with the person I've dreamed of for years? I just... I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I have a dream job offer in a foreign country, but it means leaving the man I love. I'm torn between pursuing my career and staying with him. Help me figure out what to do!

1. **throwaway123456**: "Honestly, you need to think about what's best for YOU. You've been in this relationship for 4 years and it's been on-again/off-again. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled. If this job opportunity is something that will bring you joy and fulfillment, then you should take it. Don't let fear of the unknown hold you back. You can always stay in touch with your boyfriend and see where things go."
2. **RelationshipWarrior**: "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're not going to find someone who checks all the boxes, and you can't control how others feel. If your boyfriend isn't ready for a relationship, then maybe he's not the right person for you. You deserve someone who is all in. Take the job and see where it takes you. You can always come back or stay in touch."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're being unrealistic about the relationship. You've been in an on-again/off-again relationship for 4 years, and you're still wondering if he's the right person for you? It's time to take a step back and re-evaluate. If he's not willing to commit to you, then maybe he's not the right person for you. Take the job and focus on yourself for a change."
4. **LoveIsLove**: "I think you're being too focused on the job and not enough on the relationship. If you truly love this man, then you should be willing to make sacrifices for him. But if you're only staying with him because you're scared to be alone, then maybe you're not ready for a relationship. Take some time to reflect on your feelings and what you really want. Maybe the job is a sign that you're meant to be on your own for a while."
5. **CareerChick**: "Girl, you need to take the job! You've been in this relationship for 4 years, and it's time to focus on yourself. You deserve to pursue your dreams and be happy. Don't let fear of the unknown hold you back. You can always stay in touch with your boyfriend and see where things go. Remember, you're not getting any younger, and you need to prioritize your own happiness."

**Reddit's Take:**

The majority of commenters are in favor of the OP taking the job offer, citing that it's an opportunity for personal growth and fulfillment. Many commenters believe that the OP is putting too much pressure on the relationship and that it's time to focus on herself. Some commenters also suggest that the OP is being unrealistic about the relationship and that it's time to re-evaluate whether the boyfriend is truly the right person for her.

However, there are also some commenters who are more sympathetic to the OP's situation and suggest that she should consider staying with her boyfriend and exploring the possibility of a long-distance relationship. These commenters believe that the OP is truly in love with her boyfriend and that it's worth making sacrifices for him.

Overall, the comments on this post are divided, but the majority of commenters are in favor of the OP taking the job offer and pursuing her dreams.

TITLE: Me [24 F] with the guy I've been seeing [22 M], unsure because of mixed signals

POST: This guy and I have been hanging out for 3 months now. We work together and have known each other for a few years before that. 

It started off as a once or twice a week hang out where we would also have sex. He eventually asked me out on a date, we went to the movies and dinner, for which he paid, even though I tried to offer. From there it escalated to texting, even briefly, everyday and for the past few weeks we have been hanging out three or four times a week. He is super affectionate and is always doing things to help me, whether it be at work, or smaller things when we have been hanging out. 

I'm currently confused though because we hung out Monday night at his house and we were both super tired, so we did not really get into any deep conversations. We just kinda hung around, watched tv, and eventually fell asleep. Usually we will hang out every other day or so or at least there will have been an effort to do so. I texted him last night to see what he was doing, and he responded that he was in a weird mood and feeling under the weather. I responded saying that I hope he felt better thinking that was the end of the conversation. He asked if I was doing anything yet for the night, and I said I didn't have any plans, but that I just thought of hanging out with him. He responded "I was planning on that too earlier, sorry :(".

I am just at a loss of what to think. Am I overthinking this and he just is having a bad week? Or could this be the beginning of a fade? I guess I'm just also disappointed because his dad is gone for the week and he has the house to himself, so I wrongly assumed I guess that we would be hanging out more than once, which I am also worried is clouding my judgment of the situation.

Should I even bother trying to text him again to hang out? Or just give him space and wait to see if he contacts me?

TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing (22 M) and I (24 F) have been hanging out for 3 months. We've been getting closer, but lately, he's been giving me mixed signals. We hung out Monday night, but he didn't initiate any deep conversations. He said he was feeling under the weather and asked if I was doing anything for the night. I'm unsure if I should try to hang out again or give him space.

**Comments:**

* "I think you're overthinking this. He's just having a bad week, and it's not uncommon for people to not feel like doing much when they're not feeling well. Give him some space and see if he reaches out to you again. If not, then maybe he's not as interested as you thought."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's possible that he's just not feeling well and doesn't want to bother with plans. If you're feeling unsure, you could try sending him a casual text asking how he's doing and if he's feeling better. If he responds positively, then maybe you can plan something for the future."
* "I think you should give him space and not initiate any more plans. If he's not making an effort to hang out with you, then maybe he's not that interested. You deserve better than someone who's just going through the motions."
* "I think you're reading too much into this. He's just having a bad week, and it's not a big deal. Don't overthink it and just wait to see what happens next."
* "I agree with the above comment. It's possible that he's just having a bad week and doesn't want to bother with plans. If you're feeling unsure, you could try sending him a casual text asking how he's doing and if he's feeling better. If he responds positively, then maybe you can plan something for the future." (This comment is a repeat of the second comment)

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thank you all for your input! I think I will give him space and see if he reaches out to me again. If not, then maybe he's not as interested as I thought. I will also try to send him a casual text asking how he's doing and if he's feeling better. If he responds positively, then maybe we can plan something for the future.

I think I was overthinking things and reading too much into his mixed signals. I will try to take a step back and not overanalyze the situation. Thanks again for your help and advice!

TITLE: My long-distance GF[17F] wouldn't tell a guy(who apparently has a huge crush on her) that she's in a relationship with me[19M] so he could buy her gifts, and wouldn't tell me of this. Was I crazy to be upset?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for 6 months now and everything always goes fine between us. We made it a point to always be honest with each other no matter what, and I have always been faithful to that.

I found out from a mutual friend of ours that a guy she knows has a very big thing for her and has been into her for a while now. I was unaware. This mutual friend also told me that this guy bought my girlfriend gifts, and she told me her mother bought them for her. The reason he buys her gifts is because she's not telling him that she's in a relationship with me, so he's been trying to woo her over. Quite frankly, I was hurt she was keeping our relationship a secret, especially to guys who like her.

She lied to me about the gifts and refused to tell me about all this because she wanted to avoid a conversation about it. Was I right or wrong to be upset about this whole ordeal?

TL;DR: My girlfriend kept our relationship a secret from a guy who has a crush on her, and he bought her gifts. She lied to me about it and wouldn't tell me about it. I'm upset. Was I right to be upset?

TITLE: Family using painful nickname and i want them to stop. [25F] [24F] [28F]

POST: My Uncle passed away last week. I loved him like a father and he helped pay for my college. He called me 'Ladybug' as a nickname and always has. Since he has passed, I just don't want to be known by that. My sister [28F]  [24F]and cousin have been calling me this because it reminds them of him. 

We got into an argument over it. I told them I don't want to be called Ladybug, it's something special I shared with my Uncle. I want to be known as Ellie, like they have called me for [25 years]. 

I am not really willing to compromise on this. At this point I kind of want to take a break from them. I am mourning and they keep reminding me of him in painful ways. 

Any idea how to handle this?

TL;DR: My uncle passed away and I don't want to be called 'Ladybug' anymore. My sister and cousin keep calling me that because it reminds them of him. I want to be known as Ellie, but they won't stop. I'm feeling frustrated and want to take a break from them.

---

**Comments:**

1. OP, I totally get it. It's understandable that you don't want to be reminded of your uncle's passing through a nickname that was special to him. It's your decision how you want to be referred to. You can try explaining to your sister and cousin that you're not trying to disrespect your uncle's memory, but you're just not comfortable with the nickname right now. Maybe they'll understand and respect your wishes.
2. OP, I think you should have a calm and respectful conversation with your sister and cousin about how you're feeling. It's okay to set boundaries and communicate your needs. You can say something like, "Hey guys, I know you're trying to honor our uncle's memory, but the nickname 'Ladybug' is really painful for me right now. Can we find another way to remember him that doesn't involve using that nickname?"
3. OP, I think you're being a bit unreasonable. Your uncle gave you that nickname for a reason, and it's a part of your shared history. You can't just erase it because it's painful for you right now. Maybe try to find a way to honor your uncle's memory that doesn't involve changing your nickname.
4. OP, I think you should take a break from your sister and cousin if they're not respecting your boundaries. You deserve to be treated with respect and understanding, especially during a difficult time like this. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being.
5. OP, I think you should try to find a compromise. Maybe you could agree to let your sister and cousin use the nickname 'Ladybug' occasionally, but also give them permission to use your preferred name, Ellie, most of the time. That way, you can still honor your uncle's memory while also respecting your own feelings. Just a thought!

TITLE: My [27 M] GF [25 F] of 3 years just told me she has problems with sex because of past relationships

POST: My girlfriend and I have been sleeping together since the beginning of our relationship, and recently I've started trying to gently introduce more in the bedroom. she's always had a toy, but i've been trying to introduce more positions and experiences to make things a little more fun.

the other day we started fooling around and she abdruptly stopped me saying she didn't like anything I was doing (same thing I always do), she doesn't like making out, and she doesn't want anything new. She completely shut down and wouldn't say another word to me after this.

the next day she text me saying that she's had "really terrible relationships, including really scary sex" and that "she has a problems with sex because of past relationships"

I'm not sure where to go from here, she won't talk about it, I also now have no idea what she wants in bed (she says normal sex is all she wants). Ideally I'd like for her to heal in some way and open up with me. Should we stop having sex all together for a while? I could suggest her see a therapist but I imagine that not going well.

TL;DR: GF of 3 years tells me she has problems with sex due to past relationships, won't talk about it, and I'm unsure how to proceed.

**Comments:**

* "I think it's great that she's opening up to you about this. It's not easy to talk about past traumas. You should be patient and understanding. Maybe suggest a couples therapist, but also make sure she's comfortable with the idea. It's not about 'fixing' her, but about supporting her healing process."
* "I would definitely suggest therapy. It's not about 'fixing' her, but about her healing and working through her issues. You can't 'fix' someone's trauma, but you can support them through the process. And who knows, it might even help your relationship in the long run."
* "I think you should respect her boundaries and not push her to talk about it. It's clear she's not ready. Maybe just let her know you're there for her when she is ready to talk about it. And yeah, maybe suggest therapy, but don't pressure her."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you care about her and that you want to support her, but that you also need to feel connected and intimate with her. Maybe suggest some small steps, like just cuddling or holding hands, to help her feel more comfortable."
* "I think you should take a step back and focus on building trust and intimacy in other ways. Maybe start with small, non-sexual gestures like surprise dates or thoughtful gifts. Sometimes people need to feel safe and loved before they can open up about their past traumas."

**Reddit's Response:**

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and understanding. Many users suggest that the OP should be patient and understanding, and that therapy could be a helpful step in supporting his girlfriend's healing process. Some users also suggest that the OP should respect his girlfriend's boundaries and not push her to talk about her past traumas if she's not ready. Overall, the community is encouraging the OP to prioritize his girlfriend's emotional well-being and to focus on building trust and intimacy in other ways.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: Dude, it's Valentine's Day eve, of course she's trying to get your attention. Don't overthink it, just respond with a simple "haha, nice cat" and see where it goes.
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: OP, it's possible she's trying to rekindle things, but it's also possible she's just being friendly. Don't jump to conclusions. Take your time, and see how the conversation develops before making any moves.
3. **SarcasticSally**: Oh, great, because nothing says "I'm over you" like sending a picture of a cat with a mustache on Valentine's Day eve. Just sayin'.
4. **ExperiencedEx**: OP, I've been in your shoes before. Trust me, it's not uncommon for exes to reach out around holidays or special occasions. Just be cautious and don't get your hopes up too high. You never know what her intentions are.
5. **Redditor99**: I think she's just trying to be friendly and nostalgic. Don't overanalyze it, and don't feel obligated to make a move. Just enjoy the small talk and see where it takes you.
6. **ConcernedCousin**: OP, be careful. If she's reaching out after all this time, it might be a sign she's not fully over you. Don't get your heart racing just yet. Take things slow and get to know her intentions before making any decisions.

**TL;DR:** The community is divided on whether the exGF is trying to rekindle things or just being friendly. Some suggest responding with a simple message, while others advise caution and not getting too excited. Ultimately, it's up to OP to decide how to proceed.

TITLE: I [19 M] am finding that when I meet a girl, I get turned off if I find out that they are in a sorority

POST: So I'm in college and trying to meet as many people as possible.  For some reason, I tend to immediately get turned off if I find out that a girl is in a sorority.  I am personally not the most social person and don't really like going out to many parties, but that is exactly what a lot of these girls love to do.  

Specifically, there is this girl in one of my classes that I like and we get along really well, but she's in a sorority.  Let's say, for example, we started to date. I don't know how comfortable I would be knowing that she would be at these party's, while she, and many other guys, would be drunk. 

Is it in my best interest to not pursue girls who are in a sorority? Or do I have a false sense of what some of these frat and sorority parties are like and give it a shot?

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old guy who gets turned off when I find out a girl is in a sorority. I'm worried about the party scene and don't know if I should pursue girls who are part of it.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's not about the sorority itself, but the culture surrounding it. If you're not comfortable with the party scene, it might be best to focus on girls who share your values and interests. Don't rule out someone just because of their affiliation." (u/throwaway12345)
* "I was in a sorority and I can tell you that not all of us are party animals. There are plenty of girls who are in sororities for the community service, academic support, and networking opportunities. Don't make assumptions about someone just because of their affiliation." (u/sororitygirl)
* "If you're really interested in this girl, try to get to know her beyond the sorority. Ask her about her interests, values, and goals. If you find that you have a lot in common, it might be worth exploring a relationship despite the sorority." (u/relationshipadvice)
* "I think it's okay to have preferences, but don't let it be a deal-breaker. If you're really interested in this girl, try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. She might be willing to compromise or find alternative ways to socialize." (u/communicationiskey)

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post highlight the importance of not making assumptions about someone based on their affiliation with a sorority. Many people in sororities are not party animals, and there are many other reasons why someone might join a sorority. The post also emphasizes the importance of getting to know someone beyond their affiliation and having open and honest conversations about concerns. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide what they are comfortable with and what they are looking for in a relationship.

TITLE: I [27M] have been the lover of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder [26F]. Recently recognized all her symptoms of BPD so I need advice, possibly from those who have been in a similar situations.

POST: For the last year, I have been in a very sexual relationship with this girl in whom I now see the symptoms of BPD. She's got a boyfriend and while I'm relatively open with my relationships, she gets extremely jealous. There were a couple of times where she tried to blame me for some problem that I really couldn't see myself at fault for. And then possibly as a revenge measure for me not giving a crap, she goes rebounding with some other guy (not even her bf). However after that in her calm episode, she regretted doing that on an impulse and even accepted that she might have BPD after we had a talk.

So now here's my problem. I'm a student of human behavior and after observing her behavioral patterns, researched a lot on BPD and Histrionic Personality Disorder. There were a few AMAs on Reddit as well and majority say to get out of there and cut all contact. Most of the guys there seemed to have been in serious relationships with the women in those instances. I'm in it for the amazing sex but people say that the manipulation will start setting in. I've already noticed that I've been investing more time with her over the last few months. 

She's agreed to treatment so should I bother being a support figure for her since she's got a bf anyway? Or continue with the sexytimes til things get crazier?

TL;DR: I'm in a sexual relationship with someone who has BPD symptoms. She's agreed to treatment, but I'm unsure if I should continue the relationship or cut ties.

COMMENT 1:
Dude, you're being way too rational about this. You're not just a "support figure" for someone with BPD, you're a potential enabler. You're already noticing the manipulation, and it's only going to get worse. Trust me, I've been there. I was in a relationship with someone with BPD, and it was a nightmare. I thought I could "fix" her, but really, I was just enabling her behavior. You need to prioritize your own well-being and get out of there before it's too late.

COMMENT 2:
I'm not saying you should stay or go, but you should at least consider the fact that she's agreed to treatment. That's a huge step, and it shows that she's willing to work on herself. Maybe you could be a supportive partner in her recovery? Just be aware that it's not going to be easy, and you'll need to set boundaries for yourself. And yeah, the sex is great, but it's not worth sacrificing your own mental health.

COMMENT 3:
I'm a therapist, and I've worked with people with BPD. It's not just about the person with BPD, it's about the people around them. You're already noticing the manipulation, and it's only going to get worse. You need to prioritize your own well-being and get out of there. It's not worth the emotional toll it's going to take on you. And honestly, it's not fair to the person with BPD either. They deserve better than someone who's just going to enable their behavior.

COMMENT 4:
I've been in a similar situation, and I stayed for way too long. I thought I could "fix" my partner, but really, I was just enabling their behavior. It's not worth it, trust me. You deserve better than to be manipulated and used as a crutch for someone else's emotional issues. Get out while you still can, and focus on your own well-being.

COMMENT 5:
I'm not saying you should stay or go, but you should at least consider the fact that she's agreed to treatment. That's a huge step, and it shows that she's willing to work on herself. Maybe you could be a supportive partner in her recovery? Just be aware that it's not going to be easy, and you'll need to set boundaries for yourself. And yeah, the sex is great, but it's not worth sacrificing your own mental health.

The comments on this post are a mix of opinions, with some people advising the OP to get out of the relationship and prioritize their own well-being, while others suggest that the OP could be a supportive partner in the woman's recovery and treatment. Some comments also mention the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing one's own mental health. The OP is clearly torn between their desire to continue the relationship and their concerns about the potential negative effects of being in a relationship with someone with BPD symptoms. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that they need to carefully consider the potential consequences of their actions.

TITLE: My [27 M] long distance gf [24 F] is hanging with her ex [23 M]

POST: We have known each other for a year, dating for 6 months.

My girlfriend moved back to her hometown 4 months ago, where her ex, who she dated for 5 years, also lives. We have been doing the long distance thing as best we can and I have even scheduled a trip out there.

I recently found out she is getting texts from her ex all day long and even goes and hangs out with him. She and I talked about it and she assured me she doesn't like him anymore, but considers him a dear friend. She says that she is not interested in him, but she doesn't want to rock the boat and tell him to stop.

I do not like this one bit. I of course do not want to giver an ultimatum, but I have tried saying I do not like it and she does not seem to get it only to tell me I have nothing to worry about. At this point I want to cancel the trip and say goodbye.

My question: Am I overreacting and need to grow up and get over it or should I just put an end to all of this drama and end it?

TL;DR: GF is hanging out with her ex, who she doesn't like anymore, and I'm feeling insecure and unsure what to do.

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "You're not overreacting. It's natural to feel insecure when your partner is still in contact with their ex, especially if they're still hanging out. You deserve better than to be in a situation where you're constantly worried about what's going on. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling and see if you can come to a compromise. If she's not willing to work with you on this, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I agree with the previous commenter. It's not about being overreacting or not, it's about your feelings and what you're comfortable with. You have every right to feel insecure and worried about your girlfriend's relationship with her ex. It's not about being possessive or controlling, it's about feeling secure in your relationship. Have a calm and rational conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and see if you can find a solution that works for both of you."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's something you need to consider: if your girlfriend is still in contact with her ex and hanging out with him, it's possible that she's not fully over him. It's possible that she's still got feelings for him or that she's not ready to move on. You deserve someone who is fully committed to you and not still holding onto the past. If your girlfriend is not willing to prioritize your feelings and needs, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship and consider moving on."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "I think you're feeling insecure because you're not getting the reassurance you need from your girlfriend. It's natural to feel that way, especially in a long distance relationship. I would suggest having a conversation with your girlfriend about what you need from her to feel more secure in the relationship. It might be as simple as her being more open and honest with you about her interactions with her ex or setting boundaries around their communication. Remember, communication is key in any relationship, especially in a long distance one. Don't be afraid to express your needs and feelings to your girlfriend and work together to find a solution that works for both of you."

TITLE: Me [31F] with my Husband [38 M] 12 years/4 Married, Talking about divorce. Outside of infidelity, why did you get divorce?

POST: My husband and I have been lightly talking about divorce for a while now but it looks like I may be going through with it soon. 
**Details:**
Met in college. He worked the same job until we moved out of the country for 2 years after I got laid off. I've always earned more money, paid more for things, until we lived out of the country- he earned more money. I stayed at home, had baby. We're back in the states- hes getting degree and we're planning on going back overseas with his new degree so he can earn more money. He's now studying and I'm the only one working. I came back 5 months before him to try and get settled first. So we spent that time apart. He came back in Jan. 14.

We have a 19 month old and are currently under a lot of financial stress (I'm filing chapter 7 soon, 1 income), he is trying to start a new career (teacher) and we are living with my parents and teenage brother. We have little privacy and very little time to ourselves, with or without the baby. We sleep in separate beds often because of the baby and we barely have sex (maybe once every 3 months), we're both faithful however.

 So all these are all factors...but this weekend after letting him go out to meet with a lady that he met at a teachers thing and hang out with her at an art museum all day he came home with a migraine so I let him rest. This morning we go out for brunch and he's a complete asshole to me because I don't want him to rush our brunch/mess up my semi-planned day so he can go meet up with one of his students (male) and he mentions divorce again while in the car. This triggers me to get pissed and actually go online and look into filing. 
It's hard to actually pull the trigger. I'm trying to figure out if it's the circumstancel that we're in (which is temporary but taking longer then planned) or if it's really just over. 

I'd just like to know what to do- How to figure out if this marriage is over or not.

TL;DR: 12 years together, 4 years married, talking about divorce due to financial stress, lack of intimacy, and him meeting up with a lady and a male student. I'm trying to figure out if it's just circumstantial or if it's really over.

**Comments:**

* OP, it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated. It's understandable that you're questioning whether this marriage is over or not. Have you considered couples therapy to work through some of these issues? It might help you both communicate better and find ways to navigate this challenging time.

TITLE: Really like a great guy with herpes. What should I do?

POST: Hi girls. Need some advice and never been in this position that I know of before. We've hung out for almost a month now. Never been sexual besides some kissing and light touching and he just recently told me he has had herpes for a while and for him it is very manageable. I could tell it was very hard for him to tell me. He is a big strong guy and had tears in his eyes telling me. He said he isn't on meds but he'd b willing to for sure. 

He seems like such a great guy, he has a good job, is very attractive and we click so well. We are both in our late 20s. What should I do? I know the worst part of this disease appears to be the stigma and like one in five people

Or so have it. I am scared to let him walk but obviously I don't want herpes myself. I just know if he didn't have this condition we could really be something. We have a ton of common interests and he seems to have a lot going for him. But I don't know what to do.  Any advice???

TL;DR: I really like a guy who has herpes. He's a great guy, we click well, but I'm scared of getting it. What should I do?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma faced by many people, particularly women, who are considering a romantic relationship with someone who has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The poster is torn between her feelings for the guy and her concerns about contracting the disease.

The post receives a range of responses, from those who advise the poster to prioritize her own health and well-being by avoiding the relationship, to those who suggest that the guy's willingness to be open and honest about his condition is a positive sign and that the poster should consider the potential benefits of the relationship.

Some of the responses include:

* "I would say it's not worth the risk. You deserve to be with someone who is healthy and doesn't have any STIs. Don't compromise your own health for someone who has herpes."
* "I think it's great that he was open and honest with you about his condition. That shows a lot of maturity and responsibility. If you're willing to take the risk, I think it could be a great relationship."
* "I would suggest getting tested regularly and using condoms to reduce the risk of transmission. If you're comfortable with the risk, it could be a great relationship."
* "I would say it's not worth it. You deserve better than someone who has an STI. You deserve someone who is healthy and doesn't have any STIs."

Overall, the responses reflect a range of opinions and perspectives on the issue, and the poster is left to weigh the pros and cons of the situation and make a decision that is right for her.

TITLE: I (17m) don't know what to do about a pretty good friend (16f), of about 2 years, who's drifting away. Nothing romantic.

POST: So I have a group of friends from a couple of schools who have formed around a few peoples friendships, basically hipsters and nerds, who just kind of ended up hanging around each other a bit, sharing a lot of interests, etc.

Anyway my friend came into the group kind of latish and is always saying that she feels separate, coming from a completely different school from everyone else and says she recently got very socially awkward.

She had drifted away for almost a year and I hadn't seen her for months and months so I decided to message her a few times and just see how she was doing, if she wanted to keep talking or what.

I helped her through some stuff as well as I could and she seemed to appreciate it. We kept talking and she annoyed me a few times, a combination of me having a couple of bad days and her being a bit stand offish. One of these times I unloaded a tonne of my issues onto her, basically telling her to fuck off and get off my back in a polite way. She messaged back very contritely and said she was always there for me.

Yet it doesn't seem like she is, she rarely starts conversations with me, about twice in the last 3 months and I just don't think she actually cares for me despite everything she says. Actions are worth more than words right? So currently, I've decided to stop talking to her. If she wants to talk to me, great. Otherwise as I'm the only one from the group she was talking to recently, after my 18th birthday party which I will invite her to because I've already said so, that'll be it for our friendship. Am I doi.g the right thing? I haven't really talked to her about this because I dont wanna be really needy and should I have to talk to her about it when she's ignored my problems other times?

TL;DR: Friend of 2 years, 16f, drifting away. I've tried to reach out, but she doesn't seem to care. I've decided to stop talking to her, but feel guilty about it. Should I talk to her about it or just let it go?

COMMENTS:

* "You're not being needy, you're being honest about your feelings. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being. If she doesn't care about your problems, then maybe she's not the kind of friend you need in your life."
* "I think you're being too harsh. You're giving her an ultimatum and expecting her to magically start caring about you again. Maybe she's going through her own struggles and doesn't know how to reach out. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling instead of just cutting her off."
* "I agree with OP. If someone says they're there for you but doesn't actually follow through, it's hard to trust them. OP has tried to reach out and hasn't gotten much response. It's okay to move on and focus on other friendships that are more reciprocal."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's going through a tough time and doesn't know how to reach out. But if she's not willing to listen or make an effort to stay in touch, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the friendship."
* "OP, you're not being harsh, you're being realistic. If someone says they care about you but doesn't show it, it's hard to keep the friendship going. You deserve better than someone who doesn't make an effort to stay in touch or care about your problems."

TITLE: Me [25/F] with my fiance [25 M], tells me he's not sure if we should get married-wedding in less than 4 months.

POST: We met in college and have been together for 6 years. Last summer we got engaged and we're planning a wedding for this coming summer. There have been a few ups and downs in our relationship- mainly I have an issue with him drinking and cheating on me in the past (it happened twice). He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me. I encouraged him to seek counseling instead of drinking and he did for a while, but then stopped. Also the cheating was very early on in the relationship and then once last year. He was extremely tearful and apologetic, so I (maybe naively?) forgave him.

So, fast forward to now. Things have been really great or so I've thought. He hasn't drank in at least 8 months and has been really taking care of his health. Until tonight I thought we were really happy. I was woken up to him being loud on the phone and I got up to ask him to be quiet. When I saw him I knew instantly he was drunk. We got in an argument and I shut down and left the room crying. He followed me and by this time he was also crying and saying he just "didn't think he could do it anymore." And that he's not sure if it's the right thing to do. I asked why  and basically he said because he's never seen a successful marriage (true) and that "someone better might come along." 

I am so heart broken. Obviously I know this conversation shouldn't have happened like that and in his state, but it did and now I don't know what to do. Is there any hope in this at all?

TL;DR: Fiance of 6 years, engaged for 9 months, says he's not sure if he wants to get married and mentions someone better might come along. He's struggled with drinking and cheating in the past, but has been sober for 8 months. I'm devastated and unsure what to do.

TITLE: Today, I told a story about something that happened a long time ago, then talked to my brother about it and found out I wasn't actually there. Now I feel crazy guilty and may have overreacted.

POST: I remember an event from my childhood with immense clarity. I saw an AskReddit about something similar today, and I told the whole story. What happened, how I was involved, how it felt, and how it ended up. I told them a fantastic story, one I'd never really gotten to tell before.

I talked to my brother about it later. He got confused and informed me that I wasn't even there. I'd apparently overheard my parents talking about what had happened and dreamed about it. Then I assumed that dream was what really happened.

I freaked out and logged back onto Reddit, only to find someone had figured out where it had happened. In a panic, I deleted my story of it altogether, and then deleted my account for good measure. I didn't want to get karma for it, and I didn't want that information out there.

TL;DR: I told a story about something that happened in my childhood, but it turns out I wasn't actually there. I feel crazy guilty and may have overreacted.

COMMENT 1: Dude, you're not crazy. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of sharing a story and not fact-check. I've done it before too. You're not alone.

COMMENT 2: I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's not like you intentionally fabricated the story. You genuinely believed it happened. It's a weird feeling, but it's not uncommon. Just be more mindful of your memories in the future.

COMMENT 3: I'm a psychologist, and I can tell you that this is a classic case of confabulation. It's a common phenomenon where our brains fill in gaps in our memories with details we think are real. Don't beat yourself up over it. It's not a reflection of your sanity.

COMMENT 4: I'm a bit of a skeptic, but I think you should try to remember the details of your childhood. See if you can recall anything else that might be false. It's possible that your brain is playing tricks on you.

COMMENT 5: I'm just here to say that you're not alone. I've had similar experiences where I thought I remembered something, only to find out it was false. It's weird, but it happens. Just be kind to yourself and move on.

This post and its comments demonstrate the following psychological concepts:

1. Confabulation: The tendency to fill in gaps in our memories with details we think are real, which can lead to the creation of false memories.
2. False memories: Memories that are not based on actual events, but are instead created by our brains.
3. Overconfidence: The tendency to be overly confident in our memories, which can lead to the creation of false memories.
4. Self-blame: The tendency to blame oneself for mistakes or perceived mistakes, which can lead to feelings of guilt and shame.
5. Empathy: The ability to understand and share the feelings of others, which is demonstrated in the comments of the post.

Overall, this post and its comments highlight the complexities of human memory and the importance of being mindful of our memories and the potential for false memories. It also demonstrates the importance of empathy and understanding in our interactions with others.

TITLE: [18/m] I love a girl (19/f), but I'm in an atypical friendzone. Go for it or don't risk ruining the friendship?

POST: She's amazing. Funny, super cute. She likes me, a lot, and we have a lot of physical contact. The problem is her family is super-Christian, and she, while not a fanatic, is very religious. I'm an atheist. It doesn't really bother her, and her religion doesn't really bother me. But it has restricted the bounds of our relationship.

We talked about the possibility of dating, and the way she sees it is that the relationship will never go very far, i.e. marriage. Not that she wants to go into a relationship only if she thinks she'll marry, but that she thinks that we can never break that barrier. She agrees that we'd be great together, and that we might date for years, but that eventually she KNOWS we would never go further than that.

My opinion is that we should take the happiness while we can get it. She doesn't want to go into a relationship knowing it will end, which seems pessimistic and a little illogical to me. Love is about risk, and in my opinion you go for it and if it hurts in the end, the happiness was worth it.

I think that she thinks we're done talking about it, but I'm thinking about bringing it up again. Should I risk losing her friendship, which I don't really think would happen, but would be awful, in order to state my argument better?

Additionally, I'm totally not good enough for her.

TL;DR: I'm in a friendzone with a girl I love, but she thinks we can never be more than friends because of her family's religious beliefs. Should I risk losing the friendship to try to convince her to take a chance on us?

---

This post is an example of a common dilemma in relationships: the friendzone. The OP (original poster) is torn between pursuing a romantic relationship with the girl he loves, despite the potential risks of ruining the friendship, or accepting that their relationship will never be more than platonic.

The post highlights the complexities of the situation, including the girl's religious beliefs and her perception that the relationship would never lead to marriage. The OP is torn between his desire to take a chance on the relationship and his fear of losing the friendship.

The post also touches on the theme of self-doubt, as the OP feels that he is "totally not good enough" for the girl. This self-doubt can be a significant obstacle to pursuing a relationship, as it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

The post has received a range of comments, from those who encourage the OP to take a chance on the relationship, to those who advise him to prioritize the friendship and avoid risking the relationship. Some commenters have also offered suggestions for how the OP can approach the situation, such as having an open and honest conversation with the girl about his feelings and concerns. Overall, the post highlights the challenges and complexities of navigating relationships, and the importance of considering the potential risks and rewards of pursuing a romantic relationship.

TITLE: after a year my [19/F] druze boyfriend [21/M] won't/can't tell his parents about me, and tells me we can't have a future, what should i do?

POST: already posted but im looking for more advice.

I am a non druze female who was in a relationship with a druze male, we dated for a year and for both of us it was our first love. Even though we're still young it truly feels like he's it for me and vice versa. However, recently we hit a crossroad and he decided to end things. Since in Druze culture you are unable to marry out of the culture and if you do you are no longer considered a druze, and then you and your family are looked down on and shunned in the community. However, some people i talk to say in druze culture it's different for guys and it may be acceptable for them to marry someone outside the culture. He doesn't really follow his religon/culture, he's just scared of how it'll affect his parents, he says he can't loose them or let them down. He doesn't want them to die unhappy, feeling like they failed. I really dont think they'd completely disown him, and i think he knows that, he just wants them to die content and they apparently can't if hes with someone outside the culture. But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing. But by being appart its destroying the both of us, im unable to move on and let go of him, i just can't give up hope. And he is regretting his choice everyday, but he's so torn. He tells me "maybe one day we can be together but i can't bank on that" which makes me feel like him and i can be, i can't let go.. I feel like hes just scared and he always stresses about the future, so maybe he's just having a quater life crisis? Any help of what we should do? id really appriciate it, i dont think ill ever be able to get over him.

TL;DR: 19F in a year-long relationship with 21M from a Druze background. He won't tell his parents about me and says we can't have a future together due to cultural expectations. He's torn between his parents' wishes and his own happiness. I'm struggling to move on and want to know what to do.

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS:**

* "It's not about being scared or having a quarter-life crisis, it's about his parents' expectations and the potential consequences of going against them. He needs to have an open and honest conversation with his parents about his feelings and what he wants. It's not fair to you to keep you in limbo like this."
* "You deserve better than someone who is willing to sacrifice his own happiness for his parents' approval. You need to take care of yourself and focus on your own well-being. It's okay to move on and find someone who is willing to be with you for who you are."
* "It's not about the culture or the parents, it's about his own fears and insecurities. He needs to work on himself and figure out what he wants before he can make a decision about your relationship. You can't fix his problems for him, but you can support him in his journey."
* "You need to have a conversation with him about what you want and what you're willing to accept. You can't keep living in limbo like this. You need to know what the future holds and what he's willing to do to make it work."
* "It's okay to take a break from the relationship and focus on yourself. You don't have to be with someone who is unwilling to be with you for who you are. You deserve better than that."

**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* The boyfriend's reluctance to tell his parents about the relationship is not just about being scared, but about the potential consequences of going against their expectations.
* The girlfriend deserves better than someone who is willing to sacrifice their own happiness for their parents' approval.
* The boyfriend needs to have an open and honest conversation with his parents about his feelings and what he wants.
* The girlfriend needs to take care of herself and focus on her own well-being, rather than waiting for the boyfriend to make a decision.
* It's okay to take a break from the relationship and focus on oneself, rather than trying to fix the boyfriend's problems.

TITLE: [24M] my girlfriend [25F] of 1 year, doesnt trust me anymore

POST: I've screwed up. 

I've been going out with her about a year and we have lived together about 6 months.

I've told my girlfriend a few times that I would be home by a certain time on nights out by myself and for various reasons ended up being home much later.

It's happened a few times now and each time she gets more and more angry. 

The first time I just stayed out because I was really drunk and I forgot what I'd told her. When I came home she was really upset and after a few days we made up and I promised to not let it happen again.

Then a few nights ago I went out on my own, told her I'd be home by 1am.

She was skeptical but I was adamant that she could trust me and I wouldn't do what I did last time.

But I ended up getting lost, couldn't find the right bus (we're very low on money), then had to wait over an hour for a cab, and ended up getting home at 4am.

Now she says she'll never believe a promise I make etc and she thinks I just went out to a club and didn't give a shit about her etc.

I can't prove that I couldn't get home and I can see why it looks like what she thinks (that I just said fuck it and went out till 4am and took a cab home), even though I know it's not true.

She's now not talking to me, and last time she was this upset we almost broke up.

How can I fix this?

TL;DR: I've been lying about my whereabouts and now my girlfriend doesn't trust me anymore. I know I messed up, but I'm trying to make it right.

---

This post is an example of a common relationship problem: a partner's lack of trust due to repeated instances of dishonesty. The OP (original poster) has been lying about his whereabouts and has now lost his girlfriend's trust. He is seeking advice on how to fix the situation.

The post is well-written and provides a clear summary of the situation, including the OP's perspective and the consequences of his actions. The OP is aware of the harm he has caused and is taking responsibility for his mistakes.

The post also raises important questions about trust and communication in relationships. How can the OP rebuild his girlfriend's trust? What steps can he take to ensure that he is honest and transparent in the future? How can he communicate with his girlfriend to address her concerns and work towards a resolution?

The post has received many comments and responses from users on the r/relationships subreddit, offering advice and support. Some common themes include:

* The importance of honesty and transparency in relationships
* The need for the OP to take responsibility for his actions and apologize sincerely
* The importance of communication and active listening in resolving conflicts
* The need for the OP to work on rebuilding his girlfriend's trust gradually, rather than expecting her to forgive and forget overnight

Overall, this post is a great example of a common relationship problem and the importance of honesty, communication, and trust in building and maintaining a healthy relationship.

TITLE: Tifu by leaving a shit storm

POST: So I have been working at a restaurant known as Jimmy John's for the past 3 years. 2.5 of them being a manager.  For those who don't work at jj we get a visit from corporate once about every 4 to 6 weeks. The guys was a little late in coming but we had been preparing for him for the past week. Last night I had the luxury of closing with a new guy and a worker we hired about a month ago. I can usually close the store and get out around 945 with it looking good. Well last night having a new guy and having to do double the work we didn't get out till nearly 1030. I thought it looked good but I would come to find out the next morning that wasn't the case. I go in to pick up my phone charger and the look in the assistant managers eye could kill.  I thought he was going to break down and cry.  I then find out we got a low 80. Now I don't know what to do. I could have very well just cost everyone a 750$ bonus.

TL;DR: I'm a manager at Jimmy John's and I messed up the store's closing, resulting in a low score and potentially costing everyone a $750 bonus.

TITLE: F(23)-Feeling hopeless.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 4 years now, we have lived together for close to 2, and I feel like I have let myself go. When we first met, I was 20 pounds lighter and nearly never left the house without making sure I looked good. I took pride in the way I looked, now I hardly even wear makeup and even though my boyfriend loves me and constantly tells me how beautiful I am, I feel like I've let myself go and have no idea how to find the motivation to get back to finding myself again. I need help...I'm scared one day he will wake up and realize I'm not the fit, pretty girl he fell in love with.

TL;DR: I've let myself go physically and emotionally, and I'm scared my boyfriend will leave me because of it.

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's normal to feel like you've lost your sense of self when you've been in a long-term relationship. But here's the thing: your boyfriend loves you for who you are, not for some idealized version of yourself. He's told you he thinks you're beautiful, and that's because he sees the real you, not some airbrushed version. You don't have to be a certain weight or look a certain way to be worthy of love. You're worthy of love just because you exist. And honestly, if your boyfriend can't see that, then maybe he's not the right person for you.

COMMENT 2:
OP, I think you're putting way too much pressure on yourself. You're not a different person just because you've gained a few pounds or stopped wearing makeup. You're still the same person your boyfriend fell in love with. And if he can't see that, then that's his problem, not yours. You need to focus on loving and accepting yourself, not trying to fit some idealized mold. You're beautiful just the way you are, and your boyfriend should be able to see that.

COMMENT 3:
OP, I think you're forgetting that your boyfriend has been with you for 4 years, and he's seen you at your best and worst. He knows that you're not just a pretty face, and he loves you for who you are, flaws and all. You don't have to try to be someone you're not to impress him. Just be yourself, and if he can't accept that, then he's not the right person for you. And honestly, if he does leave you because you've gained a few pounds, then he's not worth your time anyway.

COMMENT 4:
OP, I think you're putting way too much emphasis on physical appearance. Your worth and beauty come from who you are as a person, not from how you look. You're more than just a pretty face or a certain weight. You're a complex, multifaceted person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences. And your boyfriend should be able to see that. You don't have to try to fit some idealized mold to be loved and accepted. Just be yourself, and if he can't accept that, then he's not the right person for you.

COMMENT 5:

The comments on this post are overwhelmingly supportive and encouraging, with many users sharing their own experiences of feeling pressure to conform to societal beauty standards. The comments emphasize the importance of self-acceptance and self-love, and remind the OP that their worth and beauty come from who they are as a person, not from their physical appearance. The comments also encourage the OP to focus on loving and accepting themselves, rather than trying to fit some idealized mold. Overall, the comments on this post are a testament to the power of online communities to provide support and encouragement to individuals who are struggling with body image issues.

TITLE: My (28f) boyfriend (28m) watched porn excessively and was caught. Now I keep looking at his phone and invading his privacy out of insecurity. What do I do? Help! NSFW

POST: Back story: we have been dating for 2 years. About a year and a half into our relationship I was checking his internet history just to find an old website with a recipe I made for dinner before. I usually don't mind my boyfriend watching porn. It's completely unrealistic to think guys don't fap. But I found out he had been messaging the girls on the subreddit complimenting them. I flipped out naturally because that was crossing the line. He said he was addicted to porn. He went to talk to a therapist who said he didn't need to be treated. I felt betrayed but still forgave him. 

Fast forward 6 months: I find myself constantly needing to check his phone and computer to see if he watches it still or messages girls. I feel more insecure than ever. He caught me looking on his phone history. I was honest and told him that I was looking to see if he still is watching porn in random moments like he used to. What do I do? I don't like being like this. I want to trust him. I'm scared he is going to keep on doing it behind my back. 

Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: My boyfriend watches porn and I found out he was messaging girls on a subreddit. I forgave him but now I find myself constantly checking his phone and computer out of insecurity. He caught me and I'm worried he'll keep doing it behind my back. Help!

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm glad you're seeking help. It's understandable that you're feeling insecure, but constantly checking his phone and computer is not healthy. You're basically saying "I don't trust you, so I'm going to spy on you." That's not a good foundation for a relationship. You need to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you're worried about his behavior and that you need him to be honest with you. You can't control his actions, but you can control how you react to them.

COMMENT 2:
I think you're being a bit dramatic. You caught him watching porn, and he's been working on it. You forgave him and moved on. Now you're acting like he's going to cheat on you or something. You need to chill out and focus on your own issues. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should work on building your self-esteem instead of trying to control your boyfriend's actions.

COMMENT 3:
I think you're in a tough spot, OP. It's understandable that you're feeling insecure, but you need to find a way to address it without invading your boyfriend's privacy. Have you talked to him about how you're feeling? Maybe he's not even aware of how much you're checking his phone and computer. You need to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries. You can't control his actions, but you can control how you react to them.

I think you're being a bit too controlling. You caught him watching porn, and he's been working on it. You forgave him and moved on. Now you're acting like he's going to cheat on you or something.

TITLE: Girl in friendship group [18/F] has randomly switched and friendzoned me[18/M] please help?

POST: I've recently started uni, had eyes on this girl from the start, we got talking, flirting, (to be fair she said right from the start she didn't want a relationship, I wasn't phased by that though I did want something exclusive) but then we began to meet up a couple times, we kissed, texted everyday flirting, etc. but all of a sudden she's now decided she wants to call things off, we're in the same friendship group but this didn't affect us at the start and I think were both mature enough to not let that affect anything. She wont deny liking me but says since she doesn't want a relationship she doesn't want to carry on with what were doing.
I had some bad news in the family recently and since I live away from them now I feel I sort of clung to her due to the affection she gave the past few days, I fear this has put her off.

-----Most people you ask will say I'm attractive, confident and funny - I do not mean to come across arrogant it's just to give you an insight to what I'm like! She is a nice girl, a virgin, by the way, not a player-----

The question is, I really like her and I don't want things to go that easily, how can I sway her views, and look to atleast get a date and maybe more from her? I really don't feel up for the friendzone... Do I need to make her jealous, if so how? Or at least, how do I recover?

TL;DR: Girl I've been flirting with and kissing has suddenly friendzoned me, I'm 18, she's 18, we're in the same friendship group, I'm worried about getting stuck in the friendzone, how do I get her to see me as more than a friend?

---

The post has received over 200 comments, with many users offering advice and sharing their own experiences. Some common themes include:

* Be honest and open with her about your feelings and concerns
* Respect her boundaries and don't pressure her into something she's not comfortable with
* Focus on building a connection with her as a person, rather than just trying to get her to like you
* Don't try to make her jealous or play games, as this can be damaging and unfair
* Consider taking a break from the friendship group to focus on your own healing and growth

Some users also suggest that the OP (original poster) may be putting too much pressure on the situation and that it's okay to accept that she may not be interested in a romantic relationship with him. One user writes:

"I think you're putting a lot of pressure on this situation. It's okay if she doesn't want to date you. It doesn't mean you're not worthy of love or that you're not a great person. Sometimes people just don't click romantically, and that's okay. You can still be friends and have a great connection with her as a friend."

Another user suggests that the OP may be reading too much into the situation and that it's possible that the girl is just not interested in him romantically:

"I think you're overthinking this. She's made it clear she doesn't want a relationship, and you're still holding onto hope. It's okay to accept that and move on. You can still be friends and have a great connection with her, but you need to accept that she's not interested in you romantically."

Overall, the comments on this post offer a range of advice and perspectives, but many users agree that the key is to be honest, respectful, and open with the girl, and to focus on building a connection with her as a person rather than just trying to get her to like you.

TITLE: Whats your worst/best prank that back fired on you?

POST: I was in high school and went all year without getting in trouble. (First year since 2nd grade...suspended, detention, write up...). Well, on april fools, my first class i convenced my teacher to write me up for punching my sisters best friend in the face. My mother would have believed this since we did not get along at all. I had the teacher sign it, the principle and the school officer. I then received premission from the principle to go home early as if i was suspended. I called my mother 20 minutes after school started at told her i was suspended for fighting. Assuming my mother would pick me up and ground me for the day until i told her the truth after school was out (so i could sleep all day)....I was wrong. My mother called the police on me to arrest me for assult. I had to explain to the officers and my mother it was a joke. I was grounded for 3 weeks becuase of this.

TL;DR: I pulled off a prank on my teacher and convinced my mom I was suspended for fighting, but it backfired when she called the cops on me.

COMMENTS:

* "That's a great prank, but also super reckless. You could've gotten in serious trouble or even arrested for real. Glad it didn't escalate further."
* "I love how you thought you were so clever, but your mom was having none of it. Good lesson learned, I hope."
* "I'm impressed you were able to convince your teacher and principal to go along with it. That's some serious convincing skills. But yeah, not worth the risk of getting in trouble."
* "I can imagine your mom's face when she found out it was a prank. 'You're suspended for fighting?!' 'Uh, no, mom, it's April Fools...'"
* "I'm surprised you didn't get in trouble with the school for wasting their time and resources. That's some serious mischievous behavior."
* "I hope you learned your lesson and didn't pull off any more pranks like that. But if you did, I hope they were at least as good as this one."
* "I'm just curious, did you get in trouble with your teacher or principal for pulling off the prank? Or did they just laugh it off and say 'good one'?"

TITLE: Girl [19F] is mad at me [19M] because I posted a picture of a different girl to my Snapchat.

POST: All right. So this has a little backstory. The "friend" is someone I have been trying to date for the past month and a 1/2. She said yes to go out with me, but when I invite her out on a date, she says she wants to get to know me better before we jump in to anything.

Ok. I get that. We just start hanging out here and there. Get to know each other. I learn that she's had issues with her weight. It's a big problem for her. Not a problem for me. Fast forward to last Saturday (3/26), and she tells me that she's failing school and wants to focus on herself right now and isn't looking for a relationship. I was pretty broken up because it came out of nowhere and I thought things were going great.

I've still talked to her these past few days like nothing happened. Nothing relationship related, though. Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, "Bae" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways.

Last night, she sent me a snap that just said, "Wow." Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.

I asked a few of my friends about their opinion on the situation and they said she's just trying to control me. I just have no idea what I should do. Hell, I'm still confused and not sure how I really think about it.

TL;DR: Girl I've been trying to date for a month and a half is mad at me because I posted a picture of a different girl on my Snapchat. She captioned it "Bae" and it had a heart eyes emoji. I thought it was a joke and we weren't in a relationship, but she's still mad and deleted me off all social media.

**Reddit's Response:**

* Many users are quick to point out that the OP (original poster) is not in a relationship with the girl and that his actions were harmless. They suggest that the girl is overreacting and that the OP should not apologize or change his behavior.
* Some users offer advice on how to handle the situation, such as telling the girl that her reaction is unreasonable and that she needs to calm down.
* A few users suggest that the OP should take a step back and reevaluate his feelings for the girl, as her reaction may indicate that she is more invested in the relationship than he is.
* One user points out that the OP's friends may be biased and that he should consider seeking outside advice before making a decision.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The situation is complex and open to interpretation.
* The OP's actions were not malicious, but the girl's reaction was intense.
* The OP should consider seeking outside advice and reevaluating his feelings for the girl.
* The girl's reaction may indicate that she is more invested in the relationship than the OP is.

TITLE: [Serious] What value are men to women?

POST: This is a serious question, not a troll.  I've completed a stage of therapy, and my lesbian therapist has informed me I am not really lesbian or even that strongly bisexual, but instead I am emotionally unavailable.  She says I kept attracting gay and bisexual men because it was a way of telling and proving to myself I was open to dating men while also remaining safe.  She also said I tend to see relationships and men in very dire, pessimistic terms (she's correct), and am not yet open to seeing them positively.

Therapist wants to begin the next stage with me and calls it healing my emotional unavailability.  

I'm pretty scared and feel like it's worthless to even try.  Yep, I was completely over attracting gay guy after gay guy after mind game player after misogynist over psycho after headcase, but I feel "healing" this unavailability will just make me open to even worse exploitation.  So far I've experienced heterosexual men as brute, primitive, stupid, sex-obsessed oafs who prefer throwing a sports ball to interacting with women and see us only as dolls and toys -- or obsessive stalky maniacs who want to suffocate, smother and use women.  I know this is not healthy and not true.

If it's in you, Reddit, please in a serious, hopefully somewhat compassionate way list some ways heterosexual men are of value to heterosexual women.  I'll use these lists to work on my intellectual resistance to healing.  Right now I don't see any connection between women and men at all, I see no value whatsoever to men except as business partners and buddies, and I see marriage and other types of heterosexual relationships as women-exploitative.

(And yeah, I know you'll see the opposite as just as horrible, but please skip those kinds of answers right now.  I'll just use those as fuel to further hate men.)

Instead I want to see true ways men can be of value to women, so that when my resistance comes up in therapy over the next months I have a ready list I can confront my misandrist inner voice with.  For all compassionate, serious responses, REAL GRATITUDE.

TL;DR: I'm in therapy to overcome emotional unavailability and I'm struggling to see the value in men.  I want to know what value men can bring to women, so I can work on my resistance and move forward with healing.

---

This post is a serious and honest inquiry from someone who is seeking to overcome their emotional unavailability and is struggling to see the value in men. The author is not looking for a debate or a list of negative stereotypes about men, but rather a genuine and compassionate response that highlights the positive ways in which men can be of value to women.

The post has received over 1,000 comments, many of which are thoughtful and empathetic. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* Men can provide emotional support and validation
* Men can be partners in building a life together
* Men can be sources of comfort and security
* Men can be friends and confidants
* Men can be role models and mentors
* Men can be romantic partners and help women feel seen and loved

Many commenters have also emphasized the importance of mutual respect, communication, and trust in any relationship, and have encouraged the author to focus on building healthy and equal relationships rather than trying to change or fix themselves.

Overall, the response to this post has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive, and has provided the author with a wealth of information and insights to help them on their journey of healing and self-discovery.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about your feelings? They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies. Additionally, you might want to consider being open and honest with your prospect about your situation. It's better to be upfront and honest than to keep it a secret and potentially hurt someone else.

TITLE: book about a cat that eats typewriter keys, shoelaces?

POST: I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms "cat", "typewriter", "shoelaces" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.  I can't believe this book isn't a hit that immediately pops up on Amazon or google.  I loved it enough to still be talking about it almost 30 years later.  My family thinks I'm crazy, but I don't think I'm even creative enough to make this up... 

Reddit, can you please help me find this book?

TL;DR: I'm looking for a children's book from the 80s about a cat that eats typewriter keys and shoelaces, and gets bigger and bigger until it learns to eat in moderation. The book has black and white illustrations and I'm hoping to find it to give to my nephew.

Reddit, can you help me find this book? I've been searching for years and I'm starting to lose hope. I know it's a weird combination of themes, but I'm convinced it's out there somewhere. Please help me find this book and bring back a piece of my childhood! 

---

This post is a great example of a "mystery book" post, where the OP is trying to identify a book that they read as a child but can't remember the title or author. The post is well-written and provides a lot of details about the book, including the illustrations, plot, and themes. The OP is also very enthusiastic and passionate about finding the book, which makes the post more engaging and relatable.

The post has received a lot of attention and comments on Reddit, with many users trying to help the OP identify the book. Some users have suggested possible titles and authors, while others have asked follow-up questions to try to gather more information. The post has also been shared and upvoted many times, which has helped to spread the word and attract more attention to the mystery book.

Overall, this post is a great example of how Reddit can be used to help people find information and solve mysteries. The community is very active and engaged, and many users are willing to help each other out. Even if the OP doesn't find the exact book they're looking for, the post has still sparked a lot of interest and discussion, and has brought back memories of childhood books for many users.

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell and feeling the aftereffects

POST: Back when I was about 13, I was absolutely insane for Taco Bell. We decided to eat there after a long day of soccer and I ordered my grand 3 hard tacos combo and ate up.
Later that night, the tacos thought it would be a fine-ass idea to retaliate and make me feel worse than Billy Ray Cyrus felt about the progression of his shit daughter Miley. Trying to ignore the wrenching stomach pains, I went to bed and expected to wake up fine in the morning. 
I woke up at about 3AM, stomach pains pounding in my interior.
Well, knowing things couldn't be good, I expected to puke. Being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I thought "fuck-it, Ill hold it in and go back to bed.". Well, what a great idea that I pulled out of my ass.
Minutes later, puke gushed out of my mouth like Niagara Falls, hitting the left side of my bed and forming a nice pile.
Still being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I dismissed the idea of cleaning it up right now and thought "Hell, I need some sleep, I'll just do it in the morning."
So I went back to a peaceful slumber.

The next morning, I awoke with a disgusting stench and finally comprehended what had gone on the night before. I looked to where the puke should have been, but there was only an orange stain and a bit of chunky leftovers there. Fuck you, Taco Bell.
I immediately look down and see puke all over my blankets, clothing, and even bare skin. Being the movement-filled sleeper I am, I must have rolled around in the pile of puke during my sleep and successfully got it all over my bed sheets and body.
Feeling defeated, I shamefully took a long ass shower that morning and washed my bed sheets.

TL;DR: I ate Taco Bell, got food poisoning, puked all over my bed, and then rolled around in it during my sleep. I'm still traumatized by the experience.

REDDITORS' RESPONSES:

SUBREDDIT: r/loseit

TITLE: Help me lose those last few pounds!

POST: Obviously swim suit season is fast approaching, and I'd like to be in my best shape this summer. Here are the facts:
*I'm 21, female, and pretty much any extra weight I carry in my stomach.

*I'm not overweight by any means. I'm about 5'5" and fluctuate between 120 and 125 pounds.

*My body is...disproportionate, which will tie in with the first two bullets. I have very long legs, and a pretty short torso, which means pretty much ANY extra weight is visible in my stomach (since, as mentioned, I carry weight in my stomach).

Here's where r/loseit comes in. What do I do to lose those stubborn pounds in my stomach? I'm very active, I play soccer and ultimate frisbee all the time, so it's not a big deal to exercise, and I eat fairly well, though I will splurge here and there. Are there specific stomach-targeting exercises or diets that have worked for other people? I feel like I've been carrying around these same 5 pounds for half a decade now.

TL;DR: 21-year-old female, 5'5", 120-125 pounds, looking to lose those last few pounds in my stomach. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/fitnessgeek**: "Hey there! As someone who's also struggled with stubborn belly fat, I totally feel you. First of all, let me tell you that it's not just about exercise or diet - it's about hormones, genetics, and overall body composition. That being said, here are some tips that have worked for me:

* **Core exercises**: You're already active, so you're probably doing some core exercises, but I want to emphasize the importance of targeted exercises like planks, Russian twists, and leg raises. These will help strengthen your transverse abdominis muscle, which is the muscle that wraps around your spine and helps pull your belly button towards your spine.
* **High-intensity interval training (HIIT)**: HIIT is a great way to burn belly fat, as it raises your heart rate and increases your metabolism. Try incorporating HIIT workouts into your routine, like sprints, burpees, or jump squats.
* **Diet**: While it's not just about diet, a balanced diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs can help support your weight loss goals. Try to focus on whole foods like fruits, veggies, lean meats, and whole grains.
* **Stress reduction**: Stress can increase cortisol levels, which can contribute to belly fat. Try incorporating stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises into your daily routine.

Remember, losing weight is not just about aesthetics - it's about overall health and well-being. Focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term, rather than trying fad diets or quick fixes."

2. **u/healthyliving**: "I completely understand your frustration! As someone who's struggled with weight loss, I can tell you that it's not just about losing weight, but about finding a healthy balance in your life. Here are some tips that have worked for me:

* **Eat more protein**: Protein takes more energy to digest, which can help boost your metabolism and support weight loss. Aim for at least 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.
* **Incorporate healthy fats**: Healthy fats like avocado, nuts, and olive oil can help keep you full and satisfied, reducing the likelihood of overeating.
* **Focus on whole foods**: Whole foods like fruits, veggies, lean meats, and whole grains are packed with nutrients and can help support your weight loss goals.
* **Get enough sleep**: Sleep is essential for weight loss, as it helps regulate hormones and support muscle recovery. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

Remember, losing weight is not just about the number on the scale - it's about feeling good in your own skin and having the energy to live the life you want. Focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term, rather than trying fad diets or quick fixes."

3. **u/fitnessmotivation**: "Hey there! I totally feel you - it can be frustrating when you're trying to lose weight and it seems like nothing is working. Here are some tips that have worked for me:

* **Find a workout buddy**: Having someone to hold you accountable and support you can make a big difference in your motivation and progress.
* **Track your progress**: Keeping track of your workouts and progress can help you stay motivated and see the results of your hard work.
* **Celebrate small victories**: Don't be too hard on yourself - celebrate small victories along the way, like completing a tough workout or reaching a new personal best.
* **Stay positive**: Losing weight is not just about the physical changes - it's also about the mental and emotional changes. Stay positive and focus on the progress you're making, rather than getting discouraged by setbacks.

Remember, losing weight is not just about the number on the scale - it's about feeling good in your own skin and having the energy to live the life you want. Focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term, rather than trying fad diets or quick fixes."

TITLE: My boyfriend all but purposely makes me aware that he watches porn. I don't know how to broach this without sounding cray. (22f/23m)

POST: Let me first say, as a female, I very much enjoy porn. I watch it often. I do not expect my boyfriend not to watch porn when I am not around. It's normal. I am 22 and he is 23. We have lived together for 2 years.

HOW FUCKING EVER,

Every time I open my god damn laptop, there's porn.  I unflip the iPad, there's porn. I feel like every time I use a piece of technology for the day, he has already used it, beat off on it, and left the porn open for me to see.  I have come home to my laptop covered in astroglide. I open to pages of forums where he has sorted through 8 pages just to find titties when he is "using the iPad for homework" and can't be bothered to converse with me.

I don't know why I am hurt, but I am. I am a very reasonable girl and I have expressed my concern; I don't want to see the girls you beat off to. However, every chance he is presented with to make it subtley known, he takes it. Most delete their history, this son of a bitch rubs it in my face time and time again.

Is this passive aggressive? I don't see how he could be so forgetful when I have expressed my discomfort.  Wat do? How could I confront him? Do I try to shrug it off? I don't like to make a big deal out of something so stupid, but gah.

TL;DR: Boyfriend makes me aware that he watches porn by leaving it open on my laptop/IPad, and I don't know how to bring it up without sounding crazy.

TITLE: My [20F] Boyfriend [20M] Said He Doesn't Love Me

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 month and 1 week, on a date this Friday we were going for a walk and I told him that I love him. He seemed caught off guard by it and he didn't say he loves me back, which was upsetting but I didn't want to make him feel bad for not loving me back so I tried to just change the topic and continue on with our day. Now today we've been texting about it and I asked if he feels like he loves me, and he said he doesn't know yet and that he's confused, we haven't been dating very long and stuff. I felt offended by that since he was basically saying that our relationship isn't special to him in a way, and that he doesn't feel like it's serious or anything. Do you think I said it too early in our relationship? Or am I right about him not being committed by not saying it back? Keep in mind we were sort of "dating" for a couple weeks before the 1 month and 1 week even, that's just when we became official.

TL;DR: Boyfriend didn't say he loves me back after I told him I love him, said he doesn't know yet and is confused, making me feel like our relationship isn't serious to him.

---

**Comments:**

* "I think you said it too early in the relationship. You guys have only been official for a month and a half, and you're already talking about love? That's a lot of pressure. Maybe give him some space and time to figure out his feelings." (123 upvotes)
* "I don't think it's about saying it too early or too late, it's about being honest with yourself and your partner. If you're feeling like you're in love, that's okay to express. But maybe try to have a more open and honest conversation about what you both feel and where you're at in the relationship." (56 upvotes)
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. He didn't say he doesn't love you, he said he doesn't know yet. That's a big difference. Maybe try to have a calm and rational conversation about it instead of jumping to conclusions." (34 upvotes)
* "I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with him, or are you just feeling the excitement of a new relationship? Take some time to think about what you want and what you're looking for in a partner." (21 upvotes)
* "I think you should talk to him about how his words made you feel. It's okay to express your emotions and have a conversation about it. Maybe he didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but it's clear that he didn't handle the situation well." (15 upvotes)

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I might have been a bit too eager to express my feelings. I'll try to take a step back and have a more open conversation with him about it. And yeah, maybe I did say it too early in the relationship. Thanks for the perspective!" (123 upvotes)

TITLE: Me 26M with my girlfriend 25F of 4 months, wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral but i haven't met her family

POST: So my girlfriend has anxiety and is very emotional. I tend to solve problems more logically etc. Anyways, she asked if I'd go to her grandmother's funeral depending on when it was. Her grandma is currently in hospice so the time is coming soon. I've never been to a funeral before and I've never met my girlfriend's family.

The twist is that she doesn't have a good relationship with her dad and refuses to talk to him. This creates tension with her mom and her sister who live with her dad. I don't really think it's appropriate to be meeting her family at a funeral and I don't know her grandma at all. I told my girlfriend I'd take off work or whatever possible to be there for her after she gets home from the funeral (we don't live together). However, she started crying saying she really needs me there and needs someone to hold her hand. 

While I understand the logic behind this, it's also a big deal for me because 1. Her dad and her are in a feud and I really don't want to be a part of any sort of family drama at a funeral. 2. Meeting her mom and her sister or any family at her mom's funeral is going to be weird to me. Everyone's going to be crying and I don't know any of them yet, so the first time I meet them all it's going to be really sad. 3. I've never been to a funeral before and the closest thing is being in the room while putting my favorite childhood dog down with my family.

Girlfriend got really upset when I told her these reasons and said she expects to have a boyfriend who is there to support her. I understand her perspective which is why I offered to be there for her after she gets back. But she really wants to hold hands during the funeral itself.

Don't know what to do! I told her I'd think about it more, but she is still upset that she might have to 'ask someone else to go with her'.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's grandma is dying, she wants me to go to her funeral, but I've never met her family and it's a big deal for me. She's upset that I'm not willing to go, but I don't know how to handle the situation.

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's not about being a good boyfriend, it's about being a good person. If you're not comfortable attending the funeral, it's okay to say no. You can still be there for her after the funeral and offer support in other ways. Don't feel pressured to attend something that makes you uncomfortable."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're being reasonable. You've never met her family, and it's a lot to ask of you to attend a funeral without knowing anyone. Maybe you could compromise and offer to be there for her after the funeral, like you mentioned, or even offer to help with arrangements or something. That way you're still showing your support without feeling overwhelmed."
3. **u/itsjustmeagain**: "I think you're being a good boyfriend by being honest with your girlfriend about your concerns. It's not fair to expect you to attend a funeral without knowing anyone or feeling comfortable. Maybe you could have a conversation with your girlfriend about what she's expecting from you and what you're comfortable with. It might help clear the air and find a solution that works for both of you."
4. **u/awkwardturtle**: "I think you should prioritize your own emotional well-being in this situation. You've never been to a funeral before, and it's okay to take some time to process your own feelings before attending one. Maybe you could have a conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and see if there's a way to make it work for both of you. But ultimately, you should do what feels right for you."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think you're being a good boyfriend by being honest with your girlfriend about your concerns. It's not fair to expect you to attend a funeral without knowing anyone or feeling comfortable. Maybe you could offer to attend a memorial service or something instead of the funeral itself. That way you're still showing your support without feeling overwhelmed."

TITLE: TIFU by graping a guy in the head

POST: So I live in Chicago, and I fucking hate taxis. Like a lot. I swear to god those little yellow bastards are the source of all evil. The Holocaust? Taxis. Ebola? It was the taxis. My fourth grade teacher who told me my nose was big? Fucking taxis. 

I live in a 24th floor condo in Lincoln Park, and on one fine summer afternoon, I had a bowl of grapes, a balcony, and an opportunity. My burgers on the grill, I reclined in a lounge chair on the balcony and began my assault. I tossed my first grape at the first taxi, and missed. Of course, but hey, it's the thought that counts. 

A couple of grapes later, I tossed a juicy purple ball of death down, aiming for the sickening yellow roof of my sworn enemy, when along came a convertible. Nice car, I thought as the grape soared down to its target. Then the wind gusted. I lost sight of my weapon as it traveled to its final destination. I finally found it just before I saw the driver of the lovely white convertible swerve, clutching his bald head. I'm now holed up in my office after I heard sirens and saw a cop car pull over next to my accidental victim.

TL;DR: I tifu by throwing a grape at a taxi and accidentally hitting a guy in the head. Now I'm hiding in my office, waiting for the inevitable knock on the door.

EDIT: I just got a call from the guy, and he's not mad. He's actually a comedian, and he's offering me a spot on his podcast. I guess this is a win? I'm still hiding, though. I don't know if I can face the world after this.

TITLE: My friend's sister [WI] is being scammed by an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon. Is there anything we can do?

POST: It's a long story and it doesn't really matter but essentially my friend's sister (lives in WI) met someone on Match.com and has sent somewhere in the neighborhood of $30k to this Internet woman who claims to live in Oregon.

Based on [this Travel.state.gov report] (not to mention *common sense*) it is beyond a doubt that this person is a scammer.

For anyone who finds this thread in the future, a [quick search] of Reddit turned up the following similar old threads: [1] [2] [3] [4](

The scammer *IS* a real person, a white female with a foreign accent who claims to be Italian-American, has talked to my friend's sister on Skype, and based on some basic sleuthing has a phone number that seems to be a land line in Oregon. She claims to run an antique business that does appear to have a website, but there is zero actual information on it so it pretty clearly looks like a shell.

So far here are the best tips I've seen:

* Reverse image search this lady's Match.com photos
* Investigate the land line and antique business (not sure how)

I would *happily* post this scammer's personal information on 4chan or wherever if I really knew how that worked but I understand the "not your personal army" business.

It has gotten so bad that my friend and other members of the family are saying that this sister needs to give them financial power of attorney so that she doesn't keep sending all her SSI checks to this sketchy woman. It's a good step but if the sister doesn't go along with it it'll never happen.

I've seen advice on here before that ultimately going after the scammer isn't going to lead anywhere, and the problem needs to be fixed at home. I'm just asking to make sure.

TL;DR: Friend's sister in WI has sent $30k to an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon, who is almost certainly a scammer. What can we do to help?

TITLE: [NY] Am I required by state Labor Law to take a meal break after 6 hrs of work?

POST: Or can I elect to work through my so-called "legally mandated" 30 minute unpaid meal break without penal rescourse againt my employer?

I write full-time for a New York newspaper owned by an out-of-state conglomerate. I am paid hourly. My workplace is not unionized (except, for some reason, the mail room).
 
The explanation I have been given, which seems similar to one given to r/BrainStewYumYum in a [post] from Pennsylvania, is that a previous audit exposed the company to fines and repayment for not properly allowing meal breaks.

I rarely have time for an uninterrupted meal break, given the unpredictability of calls and schedule limitations of officials and often informal, chaotic schedule. I eat of course, but frequently in small poritons on the fly over even an eight hour period, often nothing more than a midday snack after breakfast at home on a sixer.

Essentially I clock 3 hrs weekly of untaken break. At a paltry $13.50/hr, that's a significant yearly loss of roughly $2,000. I have been threatened with three verbal warnings for the violation, a fourth will elevate discipline to a written warning.

Am I at the mercy of the company's self-proclaimed workplace statutes on this one, or am I permited under Labor Law to be paid for the time worked?

TL;DR: NY Labor Law requires 30-minute unpaid meal break after 6 hours of work. Can I elect to work through this break without penalty, or am I required to take it?

---

**Legal Advice**

As a general rule, New York Labor Law requires employers to provide a 30-minute unpaid meal break after 6 hours of work. However, the law does not explicitly state that employees must take this break. Instead, it requires employers to provide the break.

In your case, you are not required to take the meal break, but your employer is required to provide it. If you choose to work through your meal break, you are entitled to be paid for that time.

The threat of verbal warnings for not taking the meal break is likely an attempt by your employer to enforce their own internal policies, which may not be consistent with state labor laws. You may want to consider speaking with a labor attorney to discuss your specific situation and determine the best course of action.

It's worth noting that the law does not require employees to take their meal breaks in a specific location or at a specific time. As long as you are provided with a 30-minute break, you can choose to use it as you see fit.

In your case, since you are paid hourly, you are entitled to be paid for all hours worked, including the time you spend working through your meal break. You may want to consider keeping a record of the time you spend working through your meal break to ensure that you are being accurately compensated.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

TITLE: The dreaded semester abroad

POST: So I've known this girl since middle school, and I've been hopelessly in love with her ever since. I mean I don't know if it's love, because what is love, blah blah blah and so forth. But anyways, we were off and on in high school, we went to different colleges and we've both been with a bunch of other people, but we always come back to each other. She's told me a bunch of times that she loves me too, and that she doesn't want anybody else, but at the same time it's never really been exclusive and I don't think it would last too long if we tried to make it exclusive. Neither of us has ever lasted long in a committed relationship.

She's going to Australia next week for a semester, I'm not gonna talk to her much for a few months and she's probably gonna meet a bunch of guys who surf and play guitar on the beach and wrestle crocodiles for fun. I'm a little bit beside myself, but at the same time I want her to go and have fun and get the most out of it.

I wonder if anyone's ever had a similar situation? I'd like to give her something she could take with her that would make her think of me once in a while, whenever she takes it out and looks at it. Something really sweet that'll make her go "aaawwww!"  I know it's kind of an obscure request seeing as how nobody knows either of us, but it doesn't have to be something personal. And any ideas might help me think of something. I know this is something I should come up with on my own, but romance was never my thing and I don't have much time left. 

And honestly it doesn't have to be a gift, it could just be something we do before she leaves, but the gift idea seemed good to me. Like I said I'm really bad at this. Please help me!!!

TL;DR: Girl I've been in love with since middle school is going to Australia for a semester, I'm feeling anxious and want to give her something to remember me by. Any ideas for a sweet gift or gesture would be greatly appreciated!

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, I've been in your shoes before. I gave my girlfriend a customized journal with a note inside saying 'write me back when you're in Australia' and a bunch of inside jokes we shared. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot to her. You could also consider making a mixtape (or a playlist) with songs that are special to your relationship. It's a thoughtful gesture that shows you're thinking of her even when you're apart."
2. **relationshipguru**: "I think you're overthinking this. Sometimes the simplest gestures are the most meaningful. Why don't you just write her a heartfelt letter or make a video message telling her how you feel? It's not about the gift itself, but the thought and effort you put into it. You could also plan a special goodbye dinner or activity before she leaves. It's the memories you create together that will last, not the gift itself."
3. **romanticfool**: "Ah, the classic 'girl goes abroad' conundrum! I think you should get her a customized photo album or a beautiful piece of jewelry with a special meaning behind it. You could also plan a surprise visit to her before she leaves, or even a virtual date where you both watch the same movie or play the same game together. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something that comes from the heart and shows her how much you care."
4. **skeptical_sam**: "I'm not sure if I'd recommend getting her a gift at all. It's not like you're going to be able to keep in touch or anything. Maybe just focus on making the most of the time you have left together before she leaves? You could have a big goodbye party or something. I'm sure she'll appreciate the thought, but let's be real, she's going to be meeting new people and having new experiences. You can't compete with that."
5. **optimistic_owl**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself! It's normal to feel anxious when someone you care about is leaving, especially for a long time. But instead of focusing on what you can't control, why not focus on what you can control? You can control how you show up for her, how you support her, and how you make her feel. That's what matters most. So, take a deep breath, be present, and enjoy the time you have left together. The rest will take care of itself."

TITLE: TIFU by shooting a friend 2 Times in the head by accident

POST: So, this happend not today, but on the weekend. We went out to play football (if you're American, you'll call it soccer) on a field nearby. The game was quite even, noone scored. So we decided to take penalty shots to determine the winner. I went for the shot, kicked it hard and hit my friend straight in the face. His nose startet bleeding and he went deep into rage, while I was feeling sorry and the rest laughed thier ass of. Anyways, later that day, we played counterstrike together. He went out mid, I was playing awp, he walked into my shot, boom teamkill headshot. His rage in Teamspeak went over 9000 while our team (same guys from the football game) died laughing. My friend however got so pissed he ragequitted the game and we lost. This way I lost a good friend and my CSGO rank.

TL;DR: I accidentally shot my friend in the face during a penalty shootout, then accidentally killed him again in a game of Counter-Strike, causing him to ragequit and us to lose.

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a series of unfortunate events that occurred on the same day, involving a friend and two different activities: football and Counter-Strike.

The post starts with a description of the football game, where the OP accidentally kicks the ball and hits his friend in the face, causing his nose to bleed and leading to a heated argument. The OP then moves on to describe the Counter-Strike game, where he accidentally kills his friend with a headshot, causing him to ragequit the game and leading to their team's loss.

The post is humorous and relatable, with the OP acknowledging their mistakes and the consequences that followed. The use of colloquial language and internet slang (e.g. "TL;DR", "over 9000") adds to the post's lighthearted and playful tone.

The subreddit r/tifu is a community where people share their own stories of mistakes and mishaps, often with a humorous or ironic twist. The post above is a great example of the type of content that is typically shared on this subreddit.

TITLE: Reddit, tell me about your douchebag friend stories. I'll start

POST: So I just kind of need to vent, and I can't imagine that I'm the only one with douchebag friends.

So heres my story about... Let's call him R.

R. is a constant show-off. He's had sex with 3 girls. 1 borderline chick who faked pregnancy every month, 1 ugly chick, who was another friends ex he kept bragging about, and his (now) ex-girlfriend.

So his girlfriend recently broke up with him, because generally, he's a douchebag, smokes weed all day, and lies alot. I can't believe they've been together for over a year, because she's actually a really nice girl.

The week after they broke up, he tells me he got a girls phone number. 'Lookie me, I'm hot stuff, I got a girls phone number! She was totally into me!'. I tell him grats, good for you, and carry on. 2 days later, he tells me he got 4 other phone numbers from extroardinally hot girls.

He tells me the story of how he got the number for each girl individually. By the third girl it's getting old, but eh, I'm his friend, so I'll sit and listen. He then proceeds to tell this same story to ALL our other friends, making everybody hear the story like 3 times.

R. is not a very good looking guy. He dresses poor, he IS poor, actually, and doesn't pay attention to hygiene a whole lot. Yet he constantly keeps bragging about getting girls phone numbers, and then asks me what the last time was I had sex. (I came out of a long relationship,

TL;DR: Douchebag friend R. constantly shows off about getting girls phone numbers, lies, smokes weed, and is generally a bad influence. I'm tired of being around him.

TITLE: My [M 20] ex [21 F] is a close part of my friend group. Makes no contact near impossible and moving on more difficult.

POST: So I recently went through a somewhat messy breakup with my girlfriend of 6 months where she kinda cheated on me or at least I felt cheated on. Before being my girlfriend, she was my best friend for a year and close friend for many years before that. 

Now my high school friend group is a really close group of friends that she is a part of that has stayed close even throughout college. We all still see each other and hangout often. 

So after the breakup I prescribed to the No contact thing. We both agreed to cut off all texting and social media contact which has been really helping me for the past three weeks. The only problem is that if I still want to see my friends as often as i'd like, I do have to see her in group settings and the last two times it happened it has sent me into an anxious wreck because I see her texting or snapchatting the guy that she cheated on me with. I get that she's free to do what she wants but I just feel so betrayed and horrible everytime I see it. 

I don't know what t do reddit. I can't just never see my friends and become a shut in. These people are my closest friends in the world for a long time but I need help dealing with the minimal contact very week or every other week I need to have with her for a night of hanging out.

 Also I should point that the group is usually more than 5 or 6 people and I'm not trying to be friendly with her. I'm civil with her for the sake of it not being awkward but I don't by any means want to be close friends with her. I like the idea of no contact.

TL;DR: Ex is part of my friend group and I'm struggling to deal with minimal contact with her every week or every other week. I feel anxious and betrayed every time I see her with the guy she cheated on me with.

TITLE: TIFU by farting at the wrong time

POST: This actualy happened yesterday night but anywho. Me and my SO had a friend coming over but we decided to have a quickie before our friend arrive. So etc things happen and then my SO gets a call from our friend saying that he was close to me and my SO's apartment. The thing is that right before the call happened I was at my climax and so when my SO answered the phone i was left there for barely 30secs but felt like hours. After the phone call is done we finish what we started but as I came to release a squeaky long fart follows. 

I couldn't believe that this happened to me, I have read stories about this happening on alot of sites like 9gag and here on Reddit. I was dying of embarassement.

We just laughed it off and now here I am laughing by myself writing this for you Redditors to enjoy!

TL;DR: I farted at the wrong time during a quickie with my SO right before our friend arrived, and I'm still laughing about it.

TITLE: Friend [17 F] likes me romantically but I [17 M] am just not attracted to her at all. How can I let her down but stay friends?

POST: I've had a suspicion for a while that she liked me and it was confirmed a few days ago when her friends told me that she did. She has a bit of a history of mental problems like anxiety and depression, and I don't want her to fall back into that because of me (It happened before with another guy.)

I'm just not attracted to her so I'm not going to start a relationship with her but I want to let her down easy and in a way that we can still be friends. I'm pretty inexperienced with this so I have no idea how to go about that.

TL;DR: Friend likes me romantically, but I'm not attracted to her. How can I let her down easy and still be friends?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it's better to be honest with her. Let her know how you feel and that you value your friendship. It's okay to say no to someone's romantic feelings, but it's also important to be respectful and kind. You can say something like 'Hey, I really value our friendship and I think you're an amazing person, but I don't feel the same way romantically. I hope we can still hang out and be friends.'"
* "I agree with the above comment. It's better to be honest and clear about your feelings. You can also offer to talk to her about it in person or over the phone, rather than just messaging her. This will show that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation with her."
* "I would suggest being direct and clear about your feelings, but also being kind and empathetic. You can say something like 'Hey, I really appreciate your feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way. I think you're an amazing person and I value our friendship, but I don't think we're a good match romantically. I hope we can still hang out and be friends.'"
* "It's also important to remember that you can't control how someone else feels, and you can't make them feel a certain way. You can only control how you respond to their feelings. So, even if she's disappointed or upset, try to be understanding and empathetic. Remember that you're doing this because you want to be honest and respectful, not because you're trying to hurt her."
* "I would also suggest being prepared for the possibility that she may not want to be friends with you after you let her down. It's possible that she may feel hurt or betrayed, and that she may need some time to process her emotions. So, be prepared to give her space and respect her boundaries if that's what she needs."

This subreddit post and comments provide guidance on how to let someone down easy and still maintain a friendship. The comments suggest being honest and clear about one's feelings, being kind and empathetic, and being prepared for the possibility that the other person may not want to be friends after being let down. The post and comments also highlight the importance of respecting the other person's feelings and boundaries. Overall, the advice provided is to be direct, clear, and respectful when letting someone down, while also being understanding and empathetic.

TITLE: A new girl [16 F] just started at my work. I [17 M] tried messaging her but she won't answer

POST: This girl started at my work last week, she is a pretty girl and we seemed to hit it off. I added her on Facebook and sent her a message. It's been a couple of days now and she's been online a few times but I haven't gotten a reply. She might have seen the message but forgot to reply but it says she hasn't opened it yet. I don't work the same shifts as her and we don't go to school together otherwise I'd ask her number and I don't know how else to get a hold of her. Should I send her another message?  What should I say? Or does it seem like I should just forget about it? Thanks for your help

TL;DR: I added a new coworker on Facebook and sent her a message, but she hasn't replied. Should I send another message or forget about it?

**Top comments:**

* "Don't be discouraged if she doesn't reply right away. Maybe she's just busy or not comfortable with online communication. Try sending another message in a few days and see if she responds then."
* "It's possible she didn't see the message or forgot to reply. If you're really interested in getting to know her, you could try sending another message and asking her if she's busy or if everything is okay."
* "I would say it's okay to send another message, but maybe try a different approach. Instead of asking her out or trying to get her number, try asking her about her interests or hobbies. This can be a good way to start a conversation and get to know her better."
* "If she's not responding, it might be best to just forget about it. You don't want to come on too strong or make her feel uncomfortable. There are plenty of other people you can get to know at work."
* "I would suggest giving her some space and not sending another message. If she's not interested in talking to you, it's better to respect her boundaries and move on."

TITLE: I( f/25) hooked up with my boss (m/53). Now how do I act?

POST: I hooked up with my boss. He is the CEO of the company I work for. I knew he was married but didn't find out until later he had like 8 kids. Ack!

I have no intentions to be a home wrecker, so that's done with. However, he was the one who invited me to his hotel room and since we were both attracted to each other, we pretty much hooked up then and there. 

Now that we hooked up, he calls me every so randomly to meet up with me some more. Professionally he is hard to me in front of everyone. Then he would take me aside and ask me out for drinks. 

Anyway we haven't hooked up since that night because I never gave him the chance. How should I put it to him lightly that I don't want to hook up anymore? Deep down I'm still sexually attracted to him, but I don't want him to know because he will keep pushing it.

TL;DR: Hooked up with my 53-year-old boss, now he's calling me to meet up, but I don't want to hook up again. How do I tell him without hurting his feelings?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it's probably best to just be direct with him. You can say something like, 'Hey, I really enjoyed our time together, but I think it's best if we just keep things professional from now on.' Be firm but polite, and try not to lead him on. Remember, you're not obligated to continue a romantic relationship with someone just because you had a physical attraction to them."
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "I agree with the previous commenter. Be direct and clear about your intentions. However, you might also want to consider having a conversation with him about the power dynamic in your relationship. As your boss, he has a significant amount of power over your career, and it's important to make sure you're not putting yourself in a situation where you feel uncomfortable or compromised."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm going to say something that might sound harsh, but it's something you need to consider: you need to prioritize your career over your personal feelings. As a 25-year-old, you're at a critical point in your career, and getting involved with your boss can have serious consequences for your professional future. It's better to end things now and focus on your career than to risk getting burned and losing your job."
4. **u/anonymous_user123**: "I think you should also consider the impact this could have on his marriage and family. As a married man with 8 kids, he has a lot of responsibilities and obligations. You need to think about how your actions might affect them, even if you don't intend to hurt them. It's not just about your own feelings and desires, but also about the people who are affected by your choices."

TITLE: I've fallen back in love...

POST: This is just a personal achievement for me, but I have just read my first book in months.

Ever since my uncle passed away (he was like a father to me) I haven't been able to pick up a book and read. This is an issue as I had what my family rightfully explained as "book cravings".

I would actually get antsy if I hadn't read for a day or so, which meant that being employed full-time I found myself reading smaller novels, mostly aimed at teens (yes this includes all those vampire fictions, it was interesting to see whether the storylines differed. I'm female which made it seem less weird I guess!), just to satisfy my mind. 

The week after my uncle's funeral I engrossed myself in as many books as I could, as the previous week was spent helping my mum, grandma and sisters plan his funeral

The last novel I read was about a week after he passed away, was "Cleo" by Helen Brown. I am a great cat lover but it was more than a story about a cat and the antics it gets up to. It's about healing. And it was also the first book that almost brought me to tears. But since then I just couldn't read.

I still borrowed books but they stayed in my bag until they were due back.

Anyway, today I walked into a bookstore on a whim, and picked up "After Cleo: Came Jonah" as I loved "Cleo", and hadn't realised she had released a second book.

It was beautiful. It didn't make me want to cry, and the feel of the novel was different, but it worked so well. I actually now physically feel lighter after reading it (I started it about 5:30pm, it's now 9:50pm! Not a bad time!) and it's funny how I didn't realise I had this dark weight above me.

Just feels good to get back in touch with the book-craving me again :)

TL;DR: I've fallen back in love with reading after a 6-month hiatus due to personal issues. I'm excited to get back into it and explore new books!

COMMENTS:

* "Welcome back to the world of books! I'm glad to hear you're feeling lighter after reading. Sometimes it takes a little nudge to get back into the habit, and it sounds like 'After Cleo: Came Jonah' was just what you needed."
* "I'm so glad you're back to reading! It's amazing how much of an impact it can have on our mental health. I'm sure your uncle would be happy to see you enjoying books again."
* "I'm a big fan of Helen Brown's work, and I'm glad you enjoyed 'After Cleo: Came Jonah'! It's always great to find a new book that resonates with us. Keep reading and exploring new authors and genres!"
* "I'm so proud of you for getting back into reading! It's not always easy to pick up a new book, especially after a long break. You're doing great, and I hope you continue to find joy in reading."
* "I'm glad you're feeling lighter after reading. Sometimes it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference in our mental health. Keep reading and enjoying your books!"


This post is a great example of how reading can have a positive impact on mental health. The author has been struggling to read since their uncle's passing, but finally found a book that resonated with them and helped them feel lighter and more connected to their love of reading. The comments are also supportive and encouraging, with many people sharing their own experiences with reading and its impact on their mental health. The post and comments demonstrate the power of reading to bring people together and provide a sense of comfort and connection.

TITLE: She [F24] went silent. I [M27] have no explanation why.

POST: 1. Tinder meetup. 
1. A couple of casual dates. Enjoy each other's company + conversation. Interest is still there in both directions.
1. Nice restaurant dinner date. Perfect evening + flowing conversation. Interest increasing in both directions.
1. Home cooked dinner date (at mine) + movie + sex. Having a very nice time with this woman.
1. Friday evening restaurant dinner date. More easy + deep conversation. Go to a bar for a few wines. Walk her home, hang out for 15 minutes, listen to some music etc. She was visibly tired from a long dayshift so we end the evening. Kiss on the lips good night.
1. That was over the course of 3 or 4 weeks. I've had complete silence ever since (10 days). She has not blocked me anywhere, just complete lack of response. I kept contact to a minimum once I realised something was not right (we went from daily SMS in the week preceding to nothing). Two days ago I tried calling, no answer so I left a final SMS and plan on leaving the ball in her court.  

What reasons could she have for going completely silent?    

Possibly relevant points: Came out of a 5 year relationship approx 1 year ago. Is very intelligent. I did not detect any signals that her interest was waning.

TL;DR: Went on 4 dates, things were going well, then complete silence for 10 days. No explanation or block. What could be the reason?

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: It's possible she's just not interested in pursuing anything further. You said you didn't detect any signals that her interest was waning, but maybe she was just being polite and didn't want to hurt your feelings.
2. **relationship_advice_bot**: It's also possible that she's dealing with some personal issues or stressors that are causing her to withdraw from social interactions. If you're genuinely interested in getting to know her better, you could try reaching out to her again and asking if everything is okay.
3. **skeptical_sarah**: I think it's unlikely that she's dealing with personal issues, given that she's been responding to your messages and going on dates with you. It's possible that she's just not that into you and is trying to let you down easy by not responding.
4. **confused_couple**: Have you tried calling her again or sending her a message to ask if everything is okay? It's possible that she's just busy or overwhelmed and needs some space.
5. **tinder_tales**: I've been in a similar situation before, and I think it's likely that she's just not interested. If you're really interested in getting to know her better, you could try sending her a message asking if everything is okay, but if you don't get a response, it might be time to move on.
6. **relationship_rant**: Ugh, I hate it when people just disappear without a word. It's so rude and inconsiderate. If you're really interested in getting to know her better, you should try to have a conversation with her about what happened and how you feel.
7. **silent_treatment**: I think it's possible that she's just not interested, but it's also possible that she's dealing with some personal issues or stressors that are causing her to withdraw from social interactions. If you're genuinely interested in getting to know her better, you could try reaching out to her again and asking if everything is okay.

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for the comments, guys! I appreciate the advice and perspectives. I think I'll try reaching out to her again and asking if everything is okay. If I don't get a response, I'll probably just move on and focus on other things. Thanks again for the help!

TITLE: I believe Me [21 F] and my Boyfriend [23 M] of almost two years are about to breakup.

POST: Everything is perfect between us, me and Paul. But I am realizing that our personality differences are creating a gap that I cannot see myself able to get over for the rest of my life. All it really comes down to(in EXTREMELY simplified terms) is that I am passionate and sociable, and he is quiet and secluded. I consistently feel that I have to tame myself in order to keep him happy, and I know that in the long run, this is only going to damage both of us. We've had many conversations about how we shouldn't try to change the other person, but I am worried that if I don't leave, I /will/ change and I am not okay with the person I would need to become. 

So  I think it's time to end things, soon....the issue is we live together. Our lease isn't up until February. How am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to explain that, yes, even though everything is perfect, I can't do it anymore?

TL;DR: I'm 21, been with my boyfriend of almost 2 years, but I think our personality differences are insurmountable. I'm passionate and sociable, he's quiet and secluded. I feel like I have to change who I am to keep him happy, and I don't want to do that. We live together, and our lease isn't up until February. How do I end things?

TITLE: I'm [20F] going to a funeral for the first time, for my [69F] grandmother's [75F] best friend. I don't quite know what to do.

POST: Hi all. Sorry in advance for formatting, I'm on mobile right now. 

Very recently my grandmother's best friend died. She was like a sister to her, and I was also very close with her since I was young. The way she died was absolutely horrific, and my grandmother held her in her arms as she passed.

This Friday an open casket funeral is being held, and my grandma asked me if I would like to go. I told her I would. I have been asked to be at funerals twice before in my life, though I've refused, for (very) distant family.

My problem is that I don't deal with death/the dead well. I am not religious but spiritual. Seeing any type of dead body makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable. I don't believe that any part of a person or'soul'  stays in a body after they die, only that the body is a remaining vessel, not really the person themselves... If that makes sense. My grandma and most of my family understand and respect my beliefs but at the same time, it has always been custom for them to at least view, if not touch/kiss the forehead of their loved ones one last time. I don't think I can touch her body, let alone see it. I can't really describe what it's like, but I just get such a bad feeling from bodies, and I have never seen someone I've loved in a casket before.

Basically, I'd just like some help on how to act appropriately at the funeral, while also avoiding (as much as I can) making myself uncomfortable. In addition, it would also be cool if I could get some tips on etiquette in general, what is appropriate to wear, things like that.

TL;DR: Going to a funeral for the first time, don't know what to do, anxious about seeing a dead body, want to be respectful but also not make myself uncomfortable.

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can provide support and guidance for users who are facing difficult situations. The OP is clearly anxious about attending the funeral and is seeking advice on how to navigate the situation while being respectful to her grandmother and the deceased.

The post is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the OP's concerns and beliefs. The community responds with a mix of empathy and practical advice, offering suggestions on how to cope with the anxiety and still show respect for the deceased and her grandmother.

Some of the comments include:

* "I completely understand your concerns. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own emotional well-being. You can still show respect for your grandmother and the deceased without having to view the body."
* "It's great that you're considering your grandmother's feelings, but it's also important to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. You could consider attending the funeral, but not viewing the body. That way, you can still be there for your grandmother and pay your respects without having to confront your anxiety."
* "I think it's great that you're being honest with yourself about your feelings. It's okay to admit that you're uncomfortable with the idea of viewing a dead body. You can still show respect for the deceased and your grandmother by attending the funeral and participating in the service, even if you don't view the body."

Overall, the post and the comments provide a supportive and understanding environment for the OP to share her concerns and receive guidance on how to navigate the situation. The community's response is empathetic and practical, offering suggestions on how to balance the OP's anxiety with her desire to be respectful and supportive of her grandmother.

TITLE: me [29m] with my downstairs neighbour [30sf] and her pot smoking habit

POST: I purchased a condo about a year and a half ago and have been having an ongoing problem with the lady who lives downstairs. She smokes pot A LOT. She has told me she has a prescription for it; though we do live in an area where smoking pot is illegal. Her living room is immediately below my bathroom/bedroom. The building is old and has poor insulation which therefore means every time she smokes it fills my bathroom (and bedroom) with the smell of pot. When I first moved in I enquires with all the owners at a meeting (very small building and it's not professional managed) and each one claimed they don't smoke pot. I knew someone was lying as it cannot be smelled while outside, only inside my unit. One day I approached my neighbours door for something unrelated and was hit with the smell of pot as soon as I approached. She's since confirmed that she smokes pot but refuses to stop or smoke it outside. 

Beside the fact that I've never done pot and find the smell disgusting, I'm intending to apply for my city's police department. They have a very strict policy regarding drugs (for example, cutting out family members who do drugs, asking someone who rents to move, etc). I am very concerned that by ignoring this problem and smelling pot all the time I will be affecting my chances of being hired. 

I do not want to involve police if possible. It's a small building and this would cause a lot of animosity. 

I am looking for advice on how to escalate this and hopefully come to a resolution. I have already brought it up but she will claim she's not smoking and has no idea why I'm smelling pot. I'm not sure what my next steps should be (formal complaint, written complaint, etc)

Any advice in how to approach this and (hopefully) maintain an amicable relationship would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I have a downstairs neighbor who smokes pot a lot and it fills my bathroom and bedroom with the smell. She refuses to stop or smoke outside. I'm concerned about the smell affecting my chances of getting hired by the police department. I want to escalate this without involving the police if possible. Any advice on how to approach this and maintain an amicable relationship would be appreciated.

**Top comments:**

1. Have you tried talking to her again and explaining how the smell is affecting you? Maybe she's not aware of the impact it's having on you.
2. Have you considered talking to the building management or landlord about the issue? They may be able to help mediate the situation or provide guidance on how to address it.
3. I would suggest trying to find a compromise. Maybe she could smoke outside or in a well-ventilated area, or you could offer to help her find a different way to manage her prescription.
4. I would not recommend involving the police unless you have a legitimate reason to believe that she is breaking the law. It's possible that she has a legitimate prescription and is not breaking any laws.
5. Have you considered talking to a mediator or a neutral third party to help facilitate a conversation between you and your neighbor? This could be a good way to address the issue without escalating it further.

**Subreddit discussion:**

A few users suggest finding a compromise, such as having the neighbor smoke outside or in a well-ventilated area. Others caution against involving the police unless there is a legitimate reason to believe that the neighbor is breaking the law.

Overall, the discussion is helpful and informative, with many users offering practical advice and suggestions on how to address the issue.

TITLE: TIFU by not locking my phone

POST: It's the last day of the year. My family is quite big and most people live apart from each other. So for this year they decided to meet up at my grandmother's house: it's 21 people in a not so big house. I should mention most of them are also extremely right-wing, which made it hard for me to tell them I'm gay, so I kept postponing it.

I should mention that my phone keeps dimming the lights when I read, so I put the screen to dim at 10 minutes but to lock at 15. It's usually not a problem since I always lock it manually when I put it down.

Well, today I was sexting with my boyfriend on the bathroom. After a while I was super horny, so I threw my phone on the sink and went to take a quick shower. Once I finished it, I went to the room I was sharing with my cousin to put on some clothes.

Well, as you may have guessed, my phone was untouched long enough to dim the lights, but not enough to lock itself. My cousin took my phone and saw a bunch of dirty texts between me and my boyfriend.

And he told on me. He told on me hard.

They didn't say much to me, just a bunch of judgemental looks. I'm spending the night alone since it's too expensive to transfer my flight.

TL;DR: I TIFU by not locking my phone and my cousin saw my sexting texts, now I'm spending the night alone.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story. The OP (original poster) shares a story about how they made a mistake that led to an embarrassing and potentially harmful situation.

In this case, the OP's mistake was not locking their phone, which allowed their cousin to see their sexting texts. The OP was trying to keep their sexuality a secret from their right-wing family, and this mistake put them in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation.

The post is relatable and engaging, and the OP's honesty and vulnerability make it easy for readers to sympathize with them. The story also raises important questions about the importance of privacy and the consequences of not being able to control one's digital footprint.

Overall, this post is a great example of a TIFU story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It's a reminder that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that it's important to be mindful of our actions and their consequences.

TITLE: How to let go of a feeling that is just starting?

POST: Me (23 woman) dated a guy (29) a month ago. We didn't like each other at first sight, and I really can't remember the reason why we went out to the movies on the first place, but what I know is that after that day everything changed. 

I am really sceptic when it comes to love, cause I promised myself I would never feel again the unbearable pain of love rejection. He tried to hold my hand that day, I didn't let him (didn't feel right), the second time I saw him he tried to kiss me (didn't let him again).. that day wasn't even a date, we just saw each other casually on the street. So after that he stopped texting me.. I'm guessing he didn't like that conservative part about me... but come one.. it was only two times.. when a guy really likes you he makes an effort to see you again and earn your trust, your kisses.. 

So I realized the thing women never want to : " he just wasn't that into me".. and it was okay I was really good when it came to protect my heart.. but what I didn't know was this time I wouldn't be able to do so. I kept seeing him randomly and occasionally (cause I forgot to mention an important fact of the story: WE WORK TOGETHER). 

When we see each other at work it gets random at first, but at the end he keeps flirting with me.. it is so CONFUSING! Never been in this situation before, don't know how to react... And you guys don't need to tell me what I already now.. **HE DOES NOT WANT ANYTHING SERIOUS AND HE IS NOT THAT INTO ME**... so... why does he keep doing that? why does he keep trying to kiss me when none is looking? why does he touches my hands on purpose just to hold them for a short amount of time?

TL;DR: I dated a guy a month ago, we didn't click at first, but after a few casual encounters, he stopped texting me. I thought he wasn't interested, but now he keeps flirting with me at work, touching my hands, trying to kiss me. I'm confused and don't know how to react.

---

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like he's just trying to keep the door open, hoping you'll come back to him. He's not invested in a relationship with you, but he's not ready to let go of the possibility of something happening either. You deserve better than someone who's not clear about their intentions."
* "I think you're overthinking this. He's just a guy who's attracted to you and wants to have some fun. Don't read too much into it. You can still be friendly with him at work, but don't let him get your hopes up."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's frustrating and confusing. But honestly, it sounds like he's just trying to get attention from you. He's not interested in a real relationship, and you deserve someone who is. Try to focus on yourself and your own happiness, and don't waste your time on someone who's not invested in you."
* "I think you should have a conversation with him about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're not interested in playing games or leading him on, and that you deserve respect. You don't have to be mean or aggressive, but you do need to be clear and direct."
* "I'm so glad you're recognizing that he's not interested in a real relationship. That's a huge step! Now, focus on yourself and your own happiness. You don't need someone who's not invested in you. You deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is struggling to let go of a feeling that is just starting, which is the attraction and confusion caused by the guy's behavior.
* The comments suggest that the guy is not interested in a real relationship and is just trying to keep the door open or get attention from the OP.
* The OP is advised to focus on herself and her own happiness, and not to waste her time on someone who is not invested in her.
* Having a conversation with the guy about how she's feeling may be necessary to clear the air and set boundaries.

TITLE: I (20m) need help. I acted extremely selfish and I hurt my girlfriend(20f) with my insecurity about our relationship.

POST: We have been long distance after almost a year of being together. Once we began long distance the relationship became ten times harder and I began to question myself if I could do this. 

This led to many many fights and every single one hurt my girlfriend more and more until last night when I poured my heart and realized so many things about myself, I realized how selfish I was to her. But it was too late, she said that she was just too hurt and couldn't be with me anymore. 

This broke my heart because the only person to blame is myself. I told her I'd wait and I'd have to prove to her that I am going to do this. I don't want to go out on weekends, I don't want to and meet women all I want to do is get on Skype lay in bed and read to her until she falls asleep. Why the fuck couldn't I have just done that before without pushing her away so far away. I was just so insecure about our relationship while she was just so sure about her feelings and about herself. I felt like she was falling from a cliff and I couldn't grab and pull her back.

I want to make her feel loved, every single day and every single second I'm not around. I'm not here to ask how to get her back. I'm here to ask how can I better myself and finally become a man. I want to become a man to make her feel safe at all times, to never be afraid of me and she always has someone to go to. She said I was supposed to be her person and as much as it breaks both our hearts, I wasn't. I want to be her person and her man. Not her boyfriend anymore.

How can I better myself for the good of our relationship?

TL;DR: I hurt my girlfriend with my insecurity and selfishness, and she broke up with me. I want to better myself to become a man she can trust and feel safe with. How can I do this?

---

TITLE: Cat getting hot spots.

POST: Hey all. I'm calling all cat nutrition experts. 

My 7 year old orange shorthair developed a hot spot on her neck. Before I knew what a hot spot even was there was a running joke about how she would not know when to stop rubbing her head on stuff because she'd sometimes rub herself into a little scab. 

As far as I can remember she always would over do rubbing her head like that. It wasn't until recently she started rubbing that spot on her neck like that. 

We went to the vet to get her checked out. When I saw what she had done to herself I freaked the hell out. they sent us home with an ointment.

I didn't know that certain foods could cause a cat to start getting really itchy spots on them like that.

We have two cats. The 7 year old and a 13 year old. The 13 year old had never had any problems like this. I suspect that it has something to do with the 7 year old being a little undersized, maybe a runt. (she was also pretty undernourished when I found her 6 or so years ago trying to cross a busy street. Perhaps not the brightest.)

We feed both of our girls friskies prime fillets. mostly turkey or beef. They don't like fish too much. We used to feed them fancy feast but seemingly out of no where both of them decided they didn't want to eat it any more. We have meow mix hairball control dry food out for them. I feel like we've always fed them meow mix. 

Oh! Another thing. The two girls fight a bunch. It's never anything too out of control. They just both seem to love the same square of living room. When it gets too rough they usually cut it out or i'll intervene with a spray bottle of water. The older cat doesn't have her front claws but the younger one does. As a result the older one will nuzzle the younger cat to get her to cut it out. Could that be the reason? If so why the spots on the her ears. I've never seen the older cat go after those spots when they are playing. Again, the older cat hasn't had any issues like this. 

Anyway,

TL;DR: 7 year old cat developed hot spots on her neck and ears. We suspect it might be related to her diet. We feed her friskies prime fillets and meow mix hairball control dry food. She's a little undersized and was undernourished when we found her. She fights with the 13 year old cat and has her front claws. Could this be related to her diet or the fighting? 

Please help!

**Comments:**

1. "I'm no expert, but I think it's worth mentioning that Friskies Prime Fillets are not the best food for cats. They're high in carbs and low in protein. Have you considered switching to a higher-quality food?"
2. "I've had cats with hot spots before, and it was always related to allergies or sensitivities. Have you tried switching to a different food or adding some omega-3 supplements to her diet?"
3. "I'm not a vet, but I think it's possible that the fighting could be contributing to the hot spots. Cats can get stressed and anxious, which can lead to skin issues. Have you tried calming aids like pheromone diffusers or calming treats?"
4. "I've seen cats develop hot spots from rubbing against things, like carpets or furniture. Is it possible that your cat is rubbing against something and causing irritation?"
5. "I'm a vet, and I think it's worth considering that your cat may have a skin condition that's not related to diet or fighting. Have you tried taking her to a dermatologist or a specialist for a proper diagnosis?"

---

**TL;DR:** The original poster is seeking advice on how to treat their 7-year-old cat's hot spots, which they suspect may be related to her diet or fighting with the 13-year-old cat. The comments offer various suggestions, including switching to a higher-quality food, adding omega-3 supplements, calming aids, and consulting a dermatologist or specialist.

TITLE: Me [25/M] dealing with a group of friends ranging 19-24

POST: Hello there, r/Relationships,

I've got kind of a serious question that has been more or less wrecking my life in the last few weeks. I guess I'll start out with a quick back story. Started a study abroad program in January in Tokyo and have met some of the most wonderful people during the first 3 months of the program. We got along just fine and became fast friends. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, half the group has left while the remaining half is still here.

Here's the problem. While I had an interest in one or two girls in the group [ages 23-24] that had remained, it seems that their interests are on the other guys. Now, I never really voiced my interests for the sake of maintaining the status quo of the group, but I knew things were going on. I wanted to give them their space, but because of it, I've grown resentful.

As a result, I feel that they've become more exclusive to themselves and as such, I've told one of the people that I felt really close to my troubles. He says that no, it's not that they're trying to exclude me and that it's all in my head. There shouldn't be any problems between me and the group, but yet I still have that weird feeling that I shouldn't be treading in this territory. They do things on their own and yet, I feel that I'm more or less put on the wayside.

TL;DR: I'm 25, studying abroad in Tokyo, and I'm dealing with a group of friends ranging from 19-24. I had feelings for a couple of the girls, but they're with other guys. I feel resentful and left out, but my friend says it's all in my head. I don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, it sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions. It's normal to feel left out when you're not reciprocating the feelings of others. Maybe try having an open and honest conversation with your friends about how you're feeling. It's possible that they're not even aware of the impact their actions are having on you."
* "I think your friend is right, it's probably all in your head. You're feeling left out because you're not getting the attention you want, but that doesn't mean the others are intentionally excluding you. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationships with them and don't let your own desires dictate how you feel about the group."
* "I've been in a similar situation before and it's tough. Maybe try to focus on building relationships with other people in your program or in Tokyo. You never know who you might meet and connect with. And who knows, maybe the girls will come around and realize they're missing out on a great guy like you"
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Are you really happy with the group dynamic and the way things are going? If not, maybe it's time to re-prioritize and focus on building relationships with people who are a better fit for you."
* "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. You're not entitled to the attention of the girls just because you have feelings for them. Maybe try to focus on building relationships with the guys in the group instead. You never know, you might find someone who's a better match for you."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the comments, guys! I think I needed to vent and get some perspective on this. I think you're all right, it's probably a mix of emotions and I need to take a step back and re-evaluate my priorities. I'll try to focus on building relationships with the guys in the group and see where things go. And who knows, maybe I'll meet someone new and exciting. Thanks again for the advice and support!"

TITLE: Me [23 M] with a girl I've been dating [20 F] a 3 weeks, is telling me she has broken up with her old BF. But it appears she is lying.

POST: I am currently in college and I met this wonderful girl. We have gone on a few dates and everything appeared to be going great. She wanted to taking things quite slow because she was getting over a recent ex boyfriend.

However when I met her roommate she brought up that this girl has a boyfriend who has been acting rather shady towards her. He goes to another college and he has been spending the night "on the couch" at this other girls place frequently. He also has recently been posting on her wall and now I'm rather confused.

I know something is up but I really don't know how to handle this. I would really like to be straight forward with her but she seems dodgy whenever I do. I really am beginning to over think things and I almost feel like I was just there to shove in his face.

I really hate this situation because I feel like I could have a legitimate relationship with this girl.

TL;DR: I've been dating a girl for 3 weeks, she told me she's getting over her ex, but her roommate says she still has a boyfriend who's been acting shady. I'm unsure how to handle this and feel like I'm being used.

---

This post is an example of a common problem in relationships: dealing with dishonesty or deception. The OP (original poster) is unsure how to handle the situation and is seeking advice from the community.

The post provides a clear and concise summary of the situation, including the key points:

* The OP has been dating the girl for 3 weeks
* She told him she's getting over her ex, but her roommate says she still has a boyfriend
* The boyfriend is acting shady, spending the night at another girl's place and posting on her wall

The OP is unsure how to handle the situation and is seeking advice on how to approach the girl and whether he should continue the relationship. The post is a good example of a common problem in relationships and the community's response will likely provide valuable advice and support.

TITLE: My boyfriend waits too long in between our sexual encounters. (both 30)

POST: Together 2 years. 

We have sex like, once every 2 weeks. Tops. We used to do it more often. I try to initiate and it goes nowhere so I drop the subject. When he initiates though, he gets super butt hurt when I am not interested.

It's been 3 weeks at this point. For the past two weeks I've been trying to seduce him. It wasn't working, so I stopped all sexual things and just gave him non-sexual physical attention and taking care of my orgasms on my own. 

Yesterday he wants to get busy. At that point, I'm not even interested. After being turned down for weeks I become indifferent. Then, we have sex and it starts all over again. I get excited, try to initiate, get turned down, and as soon as I'm "over it" he wants to go again. I've tried just NOT initiating at all (maybe the chase turns him on) and that doesn't work either. 

What the fuck can I do here? Yes I have talked to him about it only to hear "I'm sorry, I'll work on it"

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have sex once every 2 weeks. I try to initiate, but he gets butt hurt when I'm not interested. I've tried seducing him, taking care of my own orgasms, and not initiating at all. What can I do?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: Have you talked to him about how his behavior is affecting you? It sounds like he's not taking your feelings into consideration. Maybe try framing it as "I feel like we're not connecting sexually because of the long wait times" instead of "you're not initiating enough". This might help him understand your perspective.
2. **u/relationship_advice**: It sounds like you're trying to solve this problem on your own, but maybe it's time to have a more open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. Try to avoid blaming or accusing language and instead focus on your own feelings and needs. You could say something like "Hey, I've been feeling really disconnected from you sexually lately. I know we used to have sex more often, and I miss that intimacy. Can we find a way to make it more regular again?"
3. **u/honesty_is_the_best_policy**: I think you're being really passive-aggressive by not initiating and then getting upset when he wants to have sex. Maybe try being more direct and honest with him about your feelings. You could say something like "Hey, I've been feeling really frustrated because we haven't had sex in a while. I know you're busy, but I need some attention and intimacy in our relationship. Can we make time for it?"
4. **u/communication_is_key**: I think you're both struggling with communication in this area. Maybe try setting a regular date night or schedule for sex, so you both know what to expect. This can help reduce the pressure and anxiety that comes with trying to initiate or not initiate.
5. **u/it_sounds_like_a_problem**: Honestly, it sounds like you're both just not that interested in sex anymore. Maybe it's time to have a bigger conversation about your relationship and whether it's still working for you both. Are you both happy with the current state of your relationship, or are there other issues that need to be addressed?

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments! I think I was being a bit too passive-aggressive and not communicating my feelings clearly. I'll try to have a more open and honest conversation with my boyfriend about how I'm feeling. Maybe setting a regular date night or schedule for sex is a good idea too. And yeah, maybe we're just not as interested in sex as we used to be, but that doesn't mean we can't find other ways to connect and intimate with each other. Thanks for the advice!

TITLE: TIFU by letting my dog into the front yard

POST: Happened 2 hours ago. Moving out tomorrow morning so I emptied my water bed water of 10 years into the back yard. Didn't want the dogs messing with that nasty water so I let them out front. Baily, the adventurous one, decided to chase a skunk. Now I'm moving to a new place tomorrow and new people are moving into my place tomorrow and I'm trying to make my house and dog not smell like skunk. Best part is I had already moved most of my stuff out so I had to run to wall greens and buy soap baking soda and hydrogen peroxide because I guess its the magic concoction.

TL;DR: Let my dog into the front yard, she chased a skunk, now my house and dog smell like skunk, and I have to move out tomorrow.

COMMENT 1: Oh man, that's a TIFU (That's what I've done) for sure! I hope you're able to get the smell out before you move out. Did you try using tomato juice or vinegar to neutralize the smell?

COMMENT 2: Ahahaha, I can just imagine the look on your face when you realized what was happening! I hope you're able to get the smell out, but honestly, it's a great story to tell at your new place. You'll be the talk of the town!

COMMENT 3: I feel for you, OP. I once had a similar experience with my cat chasing a raccoon and getting sprayed. It took me weeks to get the smell out of my house. I hope you're able to get it done before you move out. In the meantime, you might want to consider opening some windows to let the fresh air in.

COMMENT 4: I'm dying over here! I can just imagine the scene: you're trying to move out, and your dog is running around with a skunk tail, and you're trying to figure out what's going on. I hope you're able to get the smell out, but honestly, it's a great story to tell. You'll be the hero of the new neighborhood!

COMMENT 5: I've heard that white vinegar can help neutralize the smell of skunk. You might want to try mixing it with water and spraying it around the house. Also, make sure to wash your dog thoroughly with soap and shampoo to get rid of the smell. Good luck, OP! You're going to need it!

TITLE: Me [25 F] with my husband [26M] 6 years, found out he had been sexting with an old co-worker of his before we got engaged, need advice

POST: Hi, I've never done anything like this before...like at all. So I'm not even sure if I'm doing this right, didn't realize there would be a list of rules to read!But I've heard from friends that these things can be helpful, so I'm giving it a try.

Long story short, my husband of 1 month now, have been together 6 years. We have been through many ups and downs, and have been very open with each other and have really grown in our relationship. Which is a big reason why we got married.

A few days ago I found naked pictures of a girl he used to work with on his phone. They were from 2 years ago, and the date suggested about 3 months before he proposed to me.

First I know it was stupid of me to even be looking on his phone, though I wasn't looking for him cheating. Just something that is irrelevant to this problem now. But feel free to speak openly about this to me as well.

Second, I have confronted him and he has told me in phases about what happened. Though my concern is that he's not being fully honest with me or him self, because he's answered a lot of my questions with something like "I'm not sure, it was a long time ago" or "To the best of my knowledge, this is what happened." He said it was a time in our relationship when he wasn't sure where we were going, and we weren't really having a lot sex. But honestly, he never clued me in on that time in our relationship much, especially since he proposed only months later. He said he knew it was wrong immediately and feels so guilty. But he kept those pictures, and I know he never stopped his friendship with her. 

Now we're only a month into our marriage, and I'm worried about how we're going to deal with this...how I'm going to deal with this!

TL;DR: Found naked pictures of an old co-worker on my husband's phone, he sexted with her 2 years ago before we got engaged. He's being vague about the details and I'm worried about his honesty and our future.

TITLE: Reddit, what is the weirdest thing you have seen on the subway?

POST: I got the idea from another thread in here where someone claimed that the NYC subway wasn't that bad. One day, I was headed into the city to go see one of my favorite punk bands at the time. In order to get to the venue, we had to take a train downtown. While some of my friends and I were sitting on a train, I hear a woman scream and a group of people immediately walk towards the other side of the train with looks of disgust. Now, I focus my head to see what could be so bad, and it's a homeless guy. Someone else on the train is helping him on and yelling "this is a human being, i was like this man once, etc." I couldn't figure out why these people would react this way towards a homeless person. Out of nowhere my friend yells "fuck this" and runs off the train. That is when the smell of puss and infection hits me like a cockslap from Zeus. The man's foot was swollen to the size of a basketball and discolored if not rotting. Now, besides the smell and the sight, what really does it is the fact that something in his foot has popped and he is leaving a heavy trail of some brownish blood all over the train.

TL;DR: I saw a homeless guy on the subway with a rotting foot, and people were helping him and yelling at others to be kind. My friend freaked out and ran off the train.

---

This post is a great example of the weird and unexpected things that can happen on public transportation. The OP shares a personal experience of witnessing a homeless person with a severely infected foot on the subway, which is a shocking and disturbing sight. The reaction of the people around them, including the OP's friend, is also noteworthy. The post highlights the complexities of human behavior and the ways in which people can react to situations that are uncomfortable or disturbing. The tone of the post is matter-of-fact and observational, which adds to the sense of shock and disbelief. Overall, this post is a great example of the kind of unusual and thought-provoking content that can be found on Reddit.

TITLE: I [19F] have no idea how to read the situation with guys I like, or even ones I want to be friends with

POST: I just became a university student a couple months ago, and due to distance, my long term boyfriend of 2 years and I broke up. I'm pretty introverted, so he was my only friend, and he held a grudge. So here I am, introverted and alone in a STEM school which is guy-dominant, and I don't know how to interact with them. I really think it would be good for me to get out there again, but I've never been good at making friends, let alone the whole dating scene.

I joined a few clubs at the beginning of last semester, and met a group of three guy friends[all 20/M] who live together, and do everything together. I feel comfortable enough around them now, but still get nervous even asking them to hang out, because I get paranoid that I'm a nuisance. I want to become closer friends with all of them, but don't know how to go about doing that.

In particular, one of them I can't help being drawn to. He's extremely passionate, and talented, and just amazing to talk to, and he and I are a lot alike. He's not the kind of guy I usually go for, and I'm not sure what it is about him that makes him stick in my mind so much, but I can't help thinking about him. 

My problem is that he also got out of a long term relationship recently, I don't know how to get him alone without scaring him off, and I'm pretty sure he just sees me as one of the guys. One minute he'll be really honest, and be having a pretty deep conversation with me, and the next, he's laughing it up about some joke he made at my expense. 

Any advice at all would make me very happy.

TL;DR: I'm a 19F who's struggling to make friends and navigate the dating scene after a long term breakup. I've met a group of guy friends, and one of them I'm really drawn to, but I don't know how to get closer to him without scaring him off.

RESPONSES:

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Hey OP, I'm a 20M and I've been in similar situations before. First of all, it's great that you're taking the initiative to put yourself out there and make friends. As for the guy you're interested in, I think it's normal to feel drawn to someone who shares similar interests and passions. Here's what I would suggest: instead of trying to get him alone, try to find common ground with him and the other guys in your group. Ask him questions about his interests, and see if you can find something you both have in common. Also, don't be afraid to be yourself and be honest about your feelings. If he's not interested, it's okay, and you can still maintain a friendship with him. Just remember to respect his boundaries and don't push him to talk about something he's not comfortable with."

2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're trying to navigate a new social scene, make friends, and potentially get into a relationship with someone who's recently gone through a breakup. That's a lot to handle! Take things slow and focus on building genuine connections with people. Don't try to force anything or manipulate situations to get what you want. Instead, focus on being a good friend and getting to know people for who they are. If something develops naturally, that's great. But if not, that's okay too. You're still growing and learning, and that's what matters most."

TITLE: My ex-girlfriend [21] broke up with me a few weeks ago, yet still wants to hangout with me [22] every day.

POST: Hey all, I just recently was on the receiving end of my first breakup. After about five months I was told the reasoning was chemistry and her not being over her old boyfriend. The breakup wasn't dramatic, and she moved out shortly thereafter; however, she still keeps in contact with me via text in the mornings / nights, and I see her at least once or twice a day. She knows full well how I feel about her, and how I am still in love with her, but I can't tell if she's flipped the switch and "friendzoned" me that quickly or not.

I'm all for giving her space to do her own thing, and figure out her own issues... however, I can't help but feel a sting whenever we part without so much as a hug. Being the schlep that I am, I would still do anything for her and keep her as company for as long as possible (unless she started to date somebody else).

I guess I would just like to know if it's possible to rekindle the romance, or if she is just looking for the chase again.

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend broke up with me, still wants to hangout with me daily, unsure if she's friendzoned me or not, and unsure if there's a chance to rekindle romance.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're still in love with her and she's still got feelings for you, but she's not ready to commit. You need to take a step back and focus on yourself. You deserve better than to be strung along as a friend."
* "I think she's just using you as a crutch while she figures out her own stuff. You need to set boundaries and tell her how you feel. If she's not willing to work on the relationship, then it's time to move on."
* "I've been in a similar situation before, and I can tell you that it's not healthy for you to keep hanging out with her. You need to take care of yourself and focus on your own healing. It's okay to still care about her, but you can't keep putting your own feelings on hold."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Maybe she's not even aware of the impact her actions are having on you. But if she's not willing to work on the relationship, then it's time to reevaluate whether you want to stay in this friendship."
* "Honestly, I think you're just being too nice and giving her too much space. You need to set some boundaries and prioritize your own feelings. If she's not willing to respect those boundaries, then it's time to move on."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are varied, but most people agree that the OP needs to take a step back and prioritize his own feelings and well-being. Many commenters suggest that the OP should set boundaries and have an open and honest conversation with his ex-girlfriend about how he's feeling. Others suggest that the OP should focus on his own healing and move on from the relationship. Overall, the consensus is that the OP needs to take care of himself and not let his ex-girlfriend dictate his emotions and actions.

TITLE: My brother thinks entitled to a car

POST: He's been asking for a car from my parents, punching and making holes on the walls for years. Problem is, we can't afford one right now. We're struggling to pay bills. If he wanted a car, he should work for it. In the past month, my mom took a house keeping job just to keep up with day-to-day living. Instead, she poured all that money to get a car. The car was a non-op, used car (it ran, it just didn't have smog clearance yet, so we can't get it registered and insured yet). It's been a week sitting in our garage. Today, he just raised voice on mom telling her to shut her mouth because she's not letting him use the used car. My mom's reasoning was it's uninsured and failed smog test but he kept arguing that he won't get caught or get in trouble. Again, my mom can't afford to fix it yet. She just bought the car a week ago! He said he's been walking for miles and riding the bus just to get to school but not really. He gets dropped to school M-F everyday, and picked up from his friends house after school (3-4 of the 5 days). He doesn't realize my mom looking up for him and all he does is raise his voice and argue his false points. He thinks he's entitled to a car because he's 17.

He thinks it's bad. I'm 21, have a job, and still does not own a car. I go to a community college and wake up at 4AM, ride 2-3 buses just to get to school. Going back home is another 2-3 buses. All the money that I earn, I pay the house bills.

TL;DR: My 17-year-old brother thinks he's entitled to a car because he's 17, despite my parents struggling to pay bills. He's been asking for years, punching and making holes on the walls, and now he's raising his voice and arguing with my mom. I'm 21, have a job, and still don't own a car. I work hard to pay the bills, and I think he should work for what he wants.

**Comments:**

* "I'm 19 and still don't own a car. You're doing better than your brother by working and paying bills. Tell him to get a job and save up for his own car."
* "I'm 17 and I'm working part-time to save up for a car. Your brother needs to learn responsibility and stop expecting handouts."
* "Your mom is right, the car is uninsured and unregistered. Your brother needs to understand the consequences of his actions. Tell him to calm down and respect his mom's decisions."
* "I'm 22 and I still don't own a car. It's not about being entitled, it's about being responsible. Your brother needs to learn to prioritize and make sacrifices."
* "Your brother sounds like a spoiled brat. He needs to learn to appreciate what he has and stop throwing tantrums. Tell him to get a job and start saving up for his own car."
* "I'm 18 and I'm working full-time to save up for a car. Your brother needs to understand that life isn't always easy and that he needs to work for what he wants. Tell him to stop expecting handouts and start taking responsibility for his own life."

TITLE: Reddit: What Queued Your Worst "Late to the Party" Feeling?

POST: I'm a twenty-four year old white male and this past Summer met my father for the first time as an adult; from him, I learned my father was addicted to methamphetamines during the period he impregnated my mother, probably until he left our lives. She herself was addicted to crack during the whole 9month period and evidently was until I was around seventeen. We've oft been isolated by people who got to know my mother; family members, people who she gets to be friends with, neighbors, and were shunned due to this and I never really understood why.
She's never had close friends, relationships, rarely had let me out of the house, would get mad if I tried speaking with her, barely ate and thus had barely food in the house. I was made to follow this path.
She is such a sweet person, I never knew anything was off with all of this and even though I have been out of the house since nineteen, it took two years to start seeing how exactly all of that was bad and the adverse effects it had on my person. 
I recall a time making fun of crack babies in high school; looks like the jokes on me, hurr hurr.
Also, since this revelation I have been much more tolerant of people who have been intentionally indoctrinated considering my unintentional indoctrination. It's hard to know more than what you know sometimes.

TL;DR: I just found out my mom was addicted to crack during my childhood and my dad was addicted to meth, and I'm trying to come to terms with it. I'm also trying to be more understanding of people who have been intentionally indoctrinated, since I unintentionally was too.

TITLE: Men and Women of the military (past and present), what are some of the most ridiculous methods used, that you have seen or heard, to get out of the military?

POST: In recruit training, SanDiego, 2 males in my platoon were found giving/receiving oral to each other intentionally during our shower time.  Whether the two were legitimately homosexual or not is out of the question because there was no discreetness about the act whatsoever.  We had 3 shower rooms and they had left a couple minutes before everyone else to take their shower.  Fastforward a couple of minutes and there out in the open are the two guys giving each other fellatio for everyone to see.  Here is the best part about it all...instead of kicking the 2 out of the Marine Corps like they wanted...The drill instructor told them that they were both getting a 1 way ticket into the navy where they could perform these kind of acts where it is deemed normal.....(this is what was said, not in any way a hit to the navy).

So Reddit, do you have any similar stories that you have heard of or personally saw?

TL;DR: Two Marines in my platoon were caught giving each other oral sex in the shower, and instead of being kicked out, they were sent to the Navy where it was deemed "normal".

TITLE: TIFU by eating spicy chips

POST: This happened about twenty minutes ago. Let me start off by saying that I am a male in high school and enjoy self pleasure. So I am watching Doctor Who and the urge comes to me. I was eating takis at the time. For those of you who don't know, takis are a really delicious tortilla chip with a LOT of chile and lime seasoning. So I go at it not realizing what was on my hand for about 30 seconds. Pain kicked in and I had no idea what to do so I took my water bottle (luckily right next to me) and apply water onto my boys. Pain gradually subsided however still stings a bit.

TL;DR: I ate spicy chips while self-pleasuring and didn't realize what was on my hand, causing a burning sensation. I used water to alleviate the pain.

COMMENTS:

* "TIFU by eating spicy chips while self-pleasuring and not realizing what was on your hand. I hope you learned your lesson and will be more careful in the future."
* "I feel your pain, bro. I once ate a ghost pepper and didn't realize it until it was too late. I had to drink an entire glass of milk to cool down the burning sensation."
* "I'm glad you used water to alleviate the pain. I would have probably tried to use a towel or something, which would have made it worse."

TITLE: Me [18F] and boyfriend [24M] are having problems with our sex life.

POST: Our sexlife has been normal for the first 5-6 months. We had sex like every day and it was good. 
But since I got that birth control shot I don't feel like having sex that often. And I felt really bad and tired the last few weeks.
So I understand it seems like I'm making excuses but that's not what happens. 
So anyways. The last time we had sex is 4 days ago. And he says we only had "good sex" twice since 2 weeks.
I really am sorry for it but there's just no feeling of having sex sometimes. He keeps asking me why I couldn't just let him try to make me horny but it's not about the being horny part it's about that I don't even want to be horny.
We had two fights about it since yesterday cause he thinks I'm controlling our sex life which is kind of true but what's so bad about doing what I feel like and telling him if I don't want something. 
He was yelling at me and I kept saying that I'm sorry but apparently he didn't hear it.
He said he wouldn't even want it anymore and just left the house.
I was planning on having sex with him, just like yesterday, but not like this, it just makes me want to leave.
Help.

TL;DR: Me and my boyfriend have been having problems with our sex life. I got a birth control shot and it's affected my libido. He's upset and thinks I'm controlling our sex life. We had a fight and he left the house. I'm feeling guilty and unsure of what to do.

RESPONSES:

* "Hey OP, I'm not a doctor, but it's possible that the birth control shot is affecting your libido. Have you talked to your doctor about it? Maybe they can adjust the dosage or recommend something else. In the meantime, try to communicate with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It's okay to say no to sex sometimes, and it's not about controlling him, it's about taking care of yourself. Remember that your feelings are valid and don't apologize for them."
* "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your boyfriend is being really unfair and dismissive of your feelings. You're not controlling your sex life, you're just being honest about how you're feeling. It's okay to say no to sex sometimes, and it's not about him, it's about you. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and your own desires. You deserve to be respected and heard in your relationship."
* "OP, I think you're being really reasonable and honest about your feelings. It's not fair to expect you to feel a certain way just because your boyfriend wants to have sex. Maybe try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. Remember that your feelings are valid and don't apologize for them."
* "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your boyfriend is being really controlling and manipulative. You deserve to be respected and heard in your relationship. Maybe take some time to focus on yourself and your own desires. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs."

This post and the responses demonstrate the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. The OP is being honest about their feelings and needs, and the responders are offering support and validation. The post also highlights the importance of respecting each other's boundaries and desires in a relationship. The responders are encouraging the OP to prioritize their own needs and desires, and to communicate openly and honestly with their boyfriend about their feelings. The post and responses also demonstrate the importance of empathy and understanding in relationships, and the need to avoid blaming or shaming each other for their feelings and needs. Overall, the post and responses promote a healthy and respectful approach to relationships.

TITLE: Reddit, I have a totally irrational fear... How do I pull myself out?

POST: I have this fear of being murdered, in my own home, but it goes well beyond that. It all started when my car was broken into, in my own drive way. My laptop, radar detector, GPS, system, amp & sub were all taken from my car in the middle of the night. I really felt stupid for leaving my things in my car, in plain view. Following the incident, I would go outside on the back porch to smoke and almost immediately have a panic attack. I'm usually up until 4 - 5AM, so it was quite dark when I'd go out. One of my dogs would usually go out with me and she would bark at shadows. That's what triggered it. Even with every landscape light & the lights from my porch on, I'd panic at the thought of what I couldn't see beyond the lit areas. I'd race inside, usually throwing my cigarette to the ground while flailing my arms about & slam the door. From that point on, I'd have to constantly make sure the doors were locked. Every light in my house had to be on. I'd make sure my dogs are awake & alert. I'd usually wake the next morning in the recliner in my bedroom, sometimes with a knife (which I now sleep with close by). 

*NOW*, I have quit smoking. I thought that would help and it did for a few days. Unfortunately, I still freak out, every single night. I cannot be home at night without every light in my house on, in a complete panic. It's even gotten to the point that I grab all four of my dogs & stay at a friends house quite frequently. Should I seek therapy for something like this? Any home remedies for curing this kind of fear?

TL;DR: I have an irrational fear of being murdered in my own home, triggered by a car break-in and my dog barking at shadows. I'm looking for help to overcome this fear.

TITLE: From a 678 to a 615 in six weeks?

POST: I recently shopped around and went to a dealership to see what kind of financing I could get for a vehicle on their lot that I really liked and thought I could get a good deal out of. I requested a $10,000 loan.

The way my credit was at the time, I had 100% on time payments with a 12 month credit history of payments, I also had a new line from Best Buy credit that has been going two months now. Prior to this loan request, I had a 678 score. 

Shortly after talking with the dealer and running my credit, I decide that I'm not financially set enough to be buying a car. To add insult to injury, I find out over the next couple weeks that they contacted 18 various banks and credit unions for financing...all denying my loan. I would read each letter stating the reasons for denial and seeing my score drop... 658...647...630...625...and now finally 615 where I'm at the end of the inquiries. During this time, I managed to miss ONE payment from Best Buy which resulted in a single interest charge and double payment that I caught up on the next month. I am current on the payment of that now. 

I also applied for a credit card and I believe I was approved (since it was through my current bank) and I should be receiving one next week.

TL;DR: I went to a dealership, requested a $10,000 loan, and my credit score dropped from 678 to 615 in six weeks due to multiple inquiries and a missed payment. I'm trying to figure out how to recover from this and get my score back up.

---

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I'm no expert, but it seems like you're taking a pretty big hit from those inquiries. Have you considered waiting a bit before applying for more credit? You've already got a new line from Best Buy and a pending credit card approval. Maybe focus on paying those off and rebuilding your credit before applying for more?"
2. **u/creditwhiz**: "I'd recommend checking your credit report to see if there are any errors or inaccuracies that could be contributing to the score drop. Also, consider paying off that Best Buy credit card ASAP to show lenders you can manage your debt responsibly. And yeah, waiting a bit before applying for more credit is a good idea."
3. **u/personalfinancepro**: "I'd say you're experiencing a classic case of 'credit score whiplash.' It's not uncommon for scores to fluctuate significantly during periods of intense credit activity. To recover, focus on maintaining good payment habits, keeping credit utilization ratios low, and avoiding further inquiries. You might also consider disputing any errors on your report and working on building a longer credit history."
4. **u/financialfreedom**: "I'd recommend taking a step back and re-evaluating your financial priorities. You mentioned you're not financially set enough to buy a car, but are you sure that's the right decision for you? Maybe consider building up your emergency fund and improving your credit score before making such a big purchase. And yeah, waiting a bit before applying for more credit is a good idea."
5. **u/creditrepair**: "I'd suggest considering a credit repair service to help you dispute any errors on your report and work on rebuilding your credit. It might be worth the investment to get your score back on track. Just make sure to do your research and choose a reputable service."

TITLE: [16/f] deciding whether to stay at home unhappily or risk living with boyfriend (19/m) which might not be the best financially/might cause parents emotional pain

POST: Me and boyfriend (Lets call him R) have been together almost 2 years and I am seriously planning on moving in with him when I turn 18. 
BUT, I was raised in a Christian home and dont want my Christian mom to feel like a failure with me moving in (and of course breaking the marital sex rule) being not very Christian-like. It hurt my mom when both my older sisters moved out at 18, but they were different situations. They both disliked my mom because of spoiled and entitled personalities even though my mom did everything they could to give them a good life. So my mom feels like a failure with both kids hating them when they moved out and one of them heavily getting into drugs right before she moved out. I have a theory that she views me and my younger brother by two years as the good, successful kids, since we were from her current husband and not her asshole ex-husband. And we didn't get pregnant at 18 or get into drugs.
I have no hard feelings towards both of my parents, I just want to become independent and live with R. Thats where I'd feel happiest and if this didn't go through then I'd feel resent towards my parents for holding me back. 
For backstory, R wants to be a psychologist and is getting his Associates degree in accounting so while going to school for psychology will earn good money as an accountant. He's mature, logical and understandable. I don't think there's any risk in that area. He's a freshman in community college now, hes not a bum.
His mom I've talked to this about and she made a goo point saying "If you keep trying to make them happy instead of *myself* happy then I'll never be truly happy.
*I also haven't told my parents about my plans and they think I'm staying at home through college.
But this is a huge decision and I want as many opinions as possible. I've asked teachers, my two cleaned up older siblings and R's mom. But you can never have too many second opinions on a serious and life changing decision.

TL;DR: I'm 16 and planning to move in with my 19 year old boyfriend when I turn 18. I'm worried about my parents' emotional pain and my mom's feelings of failure if I move out. I'm torn between staying at home unhappily or taking the risk and potentially causing financial stress and emotional pain for my parents.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to avoid hurting your parents' feelings instead of considering what's best for you.

If moving in with your boyfriend makes you happy, then that's what you should do. It's not your responsibility to make your parents feel a certain way. They need to understand that you're growing up and making your own decisions. Have a conversation with them and be honest about your feelings and plans.

TITLE: Reddit, my mother stole money from me to ruin my family. What do I do?

POST: Repost because the last one got caught in the spam filter.

So, in February of 2010 when I was 16-17, I was the victim of a screwup at the pharmacy, which landed me in the hospital for about 4 days. I received a decent amount of money for a settlement for the screwup, and it was placed in a bank account with my mom's name on it, to be transfered to me when I turned 18. Starting in January, before my 18th birthday in March, my mother started behaving very nastily towards my father, and eventually filed a restraining order, saying he had become "violent," and "kicked in her door." I never saw any of this. He never raised a hand towards her, even though they argued frequently. He had been sleeping in the garage in the winter to avoid upsetting her, and was asking to sleep in the house. Turns out, she withdrew almost $5000 from my settlement money, to be used for college, to put a down payment on a divorce lawyer the next Monday. Now she's saying to the court that it was a "loan," even though I wasn't even aware of it until months later. I think I'm going to press charges, but I figured I'd ask what everyone else thinks. Theres a lot more to the story I'm probably missing, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

TL;DR: Mom stole $5000 from my settlement money, says it was a "loan," and is using it to fund her divorce lawyer. I'm 19 now, and I'm considering pressing charges. What do I do?

TITLE: I [20f] was rejected for saying "I love you" and am feeling a little low. How can I look at my situation in a more positive light?

POST: I [20f] have been with my boyfriend [21m] for six months. He's incredible, it's the best relationship I've ever had, and I love him. But, he doesn't feel the same way, and admits to being afraid to think that way because he's graduating at the end of the year and most likely will be leaving me.

I've had guys say they love me and then take it back, so I appreciate his honesty. Unfortunately, the logical part of my head doesn't control my tear ducts.

Admittedly, I really had my hopes up that he'd be saying "I love you" soon. I was looking for something to differentiate me from the other girls he knows. My boyfriend has a lot of female friends, and he's extremely affectionate with all of them. He practically dates them all  - takes them on one-on-one outings and stays up all night with them when  they're going through a rough time. He's a good friend, and I love that about him.

But on the other hand, I feel like the only thing that sets me apart from his friends is that he fucks me. And that doesn't feel so great.

So how can I look at this differently?

TL;DR: I'm feeling down after my boyfriend rejected my "I love you" confession. He's afraid to say it because he's graduating soon and might leave. I feel like I'm just another girl he's close to, and the only thing that sets me apart is that we have sex. How can I reframe this situation?

---

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like your boyfriend is genuinely afraid of getting hurt, and that's understandable. Instead of focusing on what sets you apart from his friends, try to focus on what you bring to the table that makes him happy. Is there something specific that you do that makes him feel good? Maybe that's what you can focus on instead of the 'I love you' confession."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being a bit harsh on yourself. Just because he doesn't say 'I love you' doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. Maybe he's just not ready to say it yet. Have you talked to him about how you're feeling? Sometimes guys need a little push to open up. Also, it's not fair to compare yourself to his friends. You're in a relationship with him, not them."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I'm going to be real with you - it sounds like your boyfriend is a player. He's got a lot of female friends, and he's extremely affectionate with all of them. That's not a healthy dynamic. You deserve better than someone who can't commit to you. Don't waste your time trying to'reframe' this situation. You deserve someone who will love and respect you for who you are."
4. **u/positivevibesonly**: "OP, I'm so sorry you're feeling down. But I want to tell you that you are so much more than just a sexual partner to your boyfriend. You're a person with feelings, thoughts, and emotions. Don't diminish your worth by comparing yourself to his friends. You are worthy of love and respect, regardless of whether he says 'I love you' or not. Keep being your amazing self, and someone who truly loves and appreciates you will come along."
5. **u/honest Abe**: "OP, I'm going to give you some tough love. If your boyfriend is afraid to say 'I love you' because he's graduating soon and might leave, that's a major red flag. He's not committed to you, and he's not willing to work through the uncertainty of your future together. You deserve someone who is willing to take risks and commit to you, even if it's scary. Don't waste your time on someone who can't make up their mind."

TITLE: Unsure if new relationship will work out, need advice

POST: (I'm 15M she's 14F) So I started dating this girl 3 weeks ago, and I'm unsure if we are compatible. She doesn't seem to trust me by what she says, and we're really different from each other I feel. She's said things like "I see us lasting a long time" and stuff like that but yeah. We don't really fight but I feel she's just kind of all over the place as a person. We had an off and on "thing" 2 months before we got together. 

She seems pretty happy with us but I'm unsure if I am. She keeps saying things like how she really loves me, and how she think I'm "the one" and stuff like that. She's also a little clingy, texts me a little too much. Sometimes her actions and what she says are little too much,(talks too much) gives me this "woah calm down" feeling inside. We had sex. (Yes I know I'm too young don't have to tell me) But this is only because she really really wanted to. I've done it with someone else already but she was a virgin. I'm a little worried that this will complicate things, even though we talked about it and how it wouldn't stop us from breaking up if something went wrong.

Now the other part...I realized I still have feelings for another girl that I liked before I dated this girl, and she likes me as well but she's also in a relationship, her relationship is going to end soon though. I think I like her more than my girlfriend...idk how bad that is but yeah. I just really don't know what to do and would love some advice.

Aidan

TL;DR: 15M dating 14F, unsure if it'll work out due to trust issues and differences. Girlfriend is clingy and talks too much. Had sex with her, but still have feelings for another girl who's in a relationship that's ending soon.

ADVICE FROM REDDITORS:

* "You're 15, dude. You're not ready for a serious relationship. Take some time to focus on yourself and figure out what you want."
* "It's not uncommon for people to have feelings for multiple people at once. But you need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about your feelings. If you're not sure if you're ready to commit, then maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship."
* "You're too young to be worrying about 'the one'. Just enjoy the moment and focus on getting to know each other better. If it doesn't work out, it's not the end of the world."
* "You need to have a serious talk with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. If she's not willing to listen and work through things with you, then maybe she's not the right person for you."
* "You're 15, dude. You're not ready for sex. It's not worth risking your relationship or your own well-being for something that's not healthy or mature."
* "It's okay to have feelings for someone else. But you need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about those feelings. If you're not sure if you're ready to commit, then maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship."
* "You're too young to be worrying about complicated relationships. Just focus on being happy and doing what's right for you."

TITLE: Me [29 M] with my GF [28 F] 2 years, she says I'm too paranoid, but I don't think it's totally fair.

POST: My GF flew off at me the other week.

I asked her if she was texting another guy and me asking this question almost made her breakup with me.

The reason I thought she might be is that she has suspicious phone activity. She uses it a lot when I'm not in the same room and quickly stops what she's doing when I come in, she recently started putting it on total silent when she comes home and she leaves her phone screen side down. This has only been happening past couple of months. Put this with the fact she has never acknowledged my existence in a public sense in anyway in 2 years and I felt a bit sus.

When I asked her if something fishy is going on she exploded and said I don't trust her etc etc went to stay at a friends house, and pretty much implied we were breaking up.

Now I feel if I have a problem with something or if I am a bit suspicious I cannot ask about it or she will instantly dump me.

Is it fair? I feel like I should be able to talk about what's bothering me. Am I too insecure with asking about her phone habits?

TL;DR: GF says I'm too paranoid, but I don't think it's fair. I asked her about suspicious phone activity and she almost broke up with me. I feel like I should be able to talk about what's bothering me.

**Comments:**

* "You're not paranoid, you're just concerned. It's normal to feel that way when you're in a relationship. You should be able to talk about your concerns without being accused of being paranoid."
* "I think you're being a bit too controlling. If she's not doing anything wrong, then why are you so fixated on her phone habits? Maybe you're just projecting your own insecurities onto her."
* "I agree with OP. If something is bothering you, you should be able to talk about it without being accused of being paranoid. It's not fair to shut down conversations about your concerns."
* "OP, have you considered that maybe your GF is just trying to have some alone time or space? Maybe she's not doing anything wrong, but just needs some time to herself. Maybe you're overthinking things."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive. If you're feeling insecure, maybe you should work on building your own confidence instead of trying to control your GF's phone habits."
* "OP, I think you're being a bit too quick to assume the worst. Maybe your GF is just trying to be more private or have some alone time. Maybe you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns instead of jumping to conclusions."

**Subreddit Insights:**

* The post received a total of 200 comments, with 50% of them agreeing with the OP's perspective that it's not fair to shut down conversations about concerns.
* 30% of the comments were neutral, suggesting that the OP should try to have an open and honest conversation with his GF about his concerns.
* 20% of the comments were critical of the OP, suggesting that he was being too controlling or possessive.

**Conclusion:**

The post received a mixed response from the subreddit community, with some users agreeing with the OP's perspective that it's not fair to shut down conversations about concerns, while others suggested that the OP was being too controlling or possessive. The post highlights the importance of communication and trust in a relationship, and the need for both partners to be open and honest with each other about their concerns and feelings. Ultimately, the outcome of the situation will depend on how the OP and his GF choose to communicate and work through their issues.

TITLE: Boyfriend (M24) keeps calling me (F19) his life partner. 2 year relationship, I don't feel the same way.

POST: So basically my boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and he keeps calling me his life partner. He believes we will be married someday and would totally be okay with being engaged and living together right now. 

I, on the other hand, don't really plan on him being my "forever" due to multiple reasons (money, he's very critical, insecure) so it makes me very uncomfortable when he says this. However, it would start a huge endless argument if I ever brought this up to him so it's better to leave it alone. 

My problem though is that I don't want to waste his time when I don't plan on this lasting forever, but I also don't want to break up right now because we have a great relationship and it's a nice thing for the time being. 

Another wrench to throw in is that he has absolutely no friends besides me. This puts a lot of pressure on me to constantly be there for him and be his only source of happiness, entertainment, and companionship. This sometimes makes me feel trapped in our relationship which is a feeling I really don't like. I don't like that feeling since I'm only 19 and have been in this relationship and one before this meaning I have always been in a relationship ever since I was 16. Sometimes I get curious about being single but I feel like I can't even consider leaving him when I'm his only source of friendship. 

I'm not suggesting I want to end our relationship. But I don't like the feeling that I basically couldn't if I wanted to. Anyone else had a similar situation or general advice for how to continue in a relationship where each partner has different expectations or if it should continue at all? 
__________________________________________

TL;DR: 2-year relationship with boyfriend who calls me his life partner, but I don't feel the same way. I'm 19, and he has no friends besides me, making me feel trapped. I don't want to break up, but I don't want to waste his time either. Advice on how to continue or if it's worth it? _______________________________________

This post is a great example of a complex relationship dilemma. The OP (original poster) is struggling with feelings of discomfort and uncertainty about their relationship. They don't feel the same way about their boyfriend's aspirations for a long-term commitment, but they also don't want to hurt his feelings or break up with him. Additionally, they feel trapped by the fact that he has no other friends and relies heavily on them for companionship.

The post highlights several key issues:

1. Different expectations: The OP and their boyfriend have different ideas about the future of their relationship, which can create tension and conflict.
2. Pressure to conform: The OP feels pressure to conform to their boyfriend's expectations, which can be overwhelming and stifling.
3. Lack of independence: The OP's boyfriend has no other friends, which means they are his sole source of social interaction and support. This can create a sense of responsibility and obligation.
4. Uncertainty about the future: The OP is unsure about whether they want to continue the relationship or not, which can be a source of anxiety and stress.

The post also raises questions about the importance of communication and honesty in relationships. The OP feels that bringing up their concerns about the future of the relationship would start a huge argument, which suggests that they may not feel comfortable having open and honest conversations with their boyfriend.

Overall, this post is a great example of the complexities and challenges that can arise in relationships. It highlights the importance of considering one's own feelings, needs, and desires, as well as the need for open and honest communication in order to navigate these challenges. _______________________________________

**Community Response:**

The community responds with a mix of advice, empathy, and personal anecdotes. Some users suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with their boyfriend about their feelings and concerns, while others recommend taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship.

Some notable comments include:

* "Have a calm and honest conversation with him about your feelings. It's better to be upfront and clear than to let things simmer and potentially cause more harm in the long run." (u/relationshipgoals)
* "I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I realized that I was staying in the relationship for the wrong reasons (fear of being alone, etc.). I took some time to focus on myself and eventually ended up leaving the relationship. It was hard, but it was the best decision I ever made." (u/strongindependentwoman)
* "I think you should take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. If you're not feeling the same way about the future of the relationship, it might be worth having a conversation with him about it. But if you're not ready to have that conversation, maybe it's better to just enjoy the relationship for what it is and not put too much pressure on it." (u/relationshipadvice)

Overall, the community response is supportive and encouraging, with many users offering words of wisdom and personal anecdotes to help the OP navigate their situation. _______________________________________

TITLE: Girl [21 F] that I [23 M] have been casually seeing for a while slept with another guy, and I have no clue what my next move should be

POST: A bit of backstory: I've been with this girl for around 5 months. It started out as a purely physical thing where we'd just hook up on a regular basis then go our separate ways, but both of us wanted to keep it exclusive. Lately we've been spending more time together and it's been getting a bit more serious, but nothing drastic. I do enjoy spending time with her though if we're being totally honest.

Jump forward to last night, we're at the bar with all our friends, and this guy she used to have a bit of a fling with is there. She's drunk, giving him a little too much attention, and I can see that he's trying to get laid. So, being the aggressively jealous person that I am, I freak out & yell, we get into a big argument, I say something hateful to the guy, and I storm out in a jealous rage.

This morning, she tells me that she ended up getting blackout drunk and they hooked up. Something about how she practically had to be carried home, and she woke up naked with the guy. She seems remorseful though, and judging from the story she gave me, it sounds like he really took advantage of her drunkenness. But I don't know what actually happened, and I probably never will. Which really makes me think I should've knocked that son of a bitch out when I had a chance, but that's life I guess.

It still makes my blood boil when I think of it though, and due to the fact that our relationship isn't all that serious, I don't know if I should cut ties, or try to put it behind us, because to be honest, the sex is amazing, and I don't think this is going to happen again. But on the other hand, our one rule was that we keep it exclusive, and she broke it. I kind of have a tendency to torture myself with this type of thing as well, so my willingness to "work it out" might just be my inner masochist talking. Feedback would be great because I'm feeling pretty torn.

TL;DR: Girl I've been casually seeing slept with another guy after we got into an argument at the bar. I'm torn between cutting ties or trying to work it out because the sex is amazing, but she broke our rule of exclusivity. Help me out, Reddit. What should I do?

TITLE: My friend (20M) have a problem with a girl (20F)

POST: I'm currently trying to help him move on from her.

Long story short, my friend met a girl in uni. They talked a bit before but only on FB (talked a bit in class also but that's about it). They went on to being in different classes due to one of them failing a year. She told him on FB that she'll hang out with him. After a while she met her current BF. Now my friend says that it's not fair that she gave her BF a chance before him even though she hasn't met either one of them. They argued about it a bit. She blocked him and unblock him after a while to help him move on.

Now it has been more than a year, and he still tries to message her in whatever way possible, to the point of harassment. She would open up accounts under her name, open up other accounts, post pictures of himself and tag her in it, etc. She has contacted the police twice, and the police has talked to him twice, warning him but he doesn't care. He has specifically said he doesn't care about going to jail, as long as she will explain why she didn't give him a chance. The police also warned that he'll be kicked out of school, but he doesn't care.

I've been trying to talk to him but his mind is locked onto this, and he said it'll basically continue until she gives him a reply to why, which she has multiple times, but he thinks she's not being truthful. I'm not sure how to help him move on, as he clearly cant and I don't want him to get kicked out of school/going to jail because of a girl..

TL;DR: Friend is obsessed with a girl who blocked him after he got upset she gave her BF a chance. He's been harassing her for over a year, despite police warnings, and won't move on. How can I help him?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're doing the right thing by trying to help your friend. It's clear that he's not going to listen to reason and is going to continue down this path until he gets what he wants. You might want to consider talking to a counselor or therapist about this situation. They might be able to help your friend work through his feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms."
2. **u/relationship_advice_bot**: "It's great that you're trying to help your friend, but it's important to recognize that you can't fix this situation on your own. It's not your responsibility to'save' your friend from his own actions. Instead, focus on supporting him and encouraging him to seek help. You can also try to help him see that his behavior is not okay and that it's not going to get him the outcome he wants. Remember that you can't control others, but you can control how you respond to the situation."
3. **u/skeptical_squirrel**: "I think it's time to stage an intervention. Get a group of friends together and have a calm, rational conversation with your friend about how his behavior is affecting not only the girl, but also himself. It's clear that he's not going to stop until he gets what he wants, and that's not healthy. You might also want to consider reporting his behavior to the school administration and getting him kicked out of school. It's not worth risking his future over a girl who clearly doesn't want anything to do with him."
4. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you should try to help your friend see that he's not going to get the outcome he wants by harassing the girl. It's not going to make her fall in love with him or give him a reason to stay in touch. Instead, he should focus on moving on and finding someone who is interested in him. You can also try to help him see that he's not the only one who has been hurt in this situation. The girl has been affected by his behavior too, and it's not okay to disregard her feelings and boundaries."
5. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think it's important to recognize that your friend's behavior is not just about the girl, but also about his own insecurities and fears. He's not just trying to get the girl, he's trying to prove something to himself. You might want to try to help him see that he's not going to find validation or self-worth through someone else. He needs to work on building his own self-esteem and confidence. That way, he'll be able to move on and find someone who is interested in him for who he is, not just because he's trying to prove a point."

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my gf [17 F] of eight months broke up the other day because of her dad found out we had sex

POST: Alright, well this Sunday, the 27, I picked my girlfriend up to take to my house. Halfway there she receives and call from her mom and I have tot take her home. I didn't know what it was about, so I drop her off and take her home. I get back to my house and her father texted me that based on some information he had received, he didn't want me to see his daughter anymore. I'm here think, "Well f***." 

I call my gf later to see what happened. It turns out that her parents snooped around her room and read the messages off of her iPod (which receive her texts as well as her phone). We were talking about how we had sex and yada-yada. So her parents yelled at her and then her dad texted me that. 

Yesterday we officially broke-up because I argued with her father about the whole scenario (I know, stupid me) because I couldn't handle how he didn't see me right for his daughter just because we had sex. So she ended it because it was between me or her father. 

Since then we've still been talking and there's a lot of feelings going around - neither of us want our relationship to be over. How do I convince her parents that we should continue dating? I know I could get over her but I really don't want that to happen. A lot of stuff happens in eight months.. I honestly think I love her, but maybe I'm just young. 

Seriously though, can anyone help me with how I should handle this situation? I really want to stay with her.

TL;DR: My 17-year-old girlfriend and I broke up because her dad found out we had sex and he doesn't want me to see his daughter anymore. We've been talking and there's still feelings between us. How do I convince her parents that we should continue dating?

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're 17. You're not ready for the kind of drama that comes with dating a girl whose parents don't approve of you. Trust me, it's better to focus on your own life and education right now. You can always try to rekindle things in a few years when you're both more mature."
2. **RelationshipAdviceBot**: "I'm not a relationship expert, but it seems like you're trying to convince her parents to approve of your relationship. Instead, why not focus on rebuilding trust with your girlfriend? If she's willing to work through this with you, that's a good sign. But if her parents are still opposed, it might be best to respect their wishes and move on."
3. **SarcasticSally**: "Oh, great, because nothing says 'healthy relationship' like sneaking around and having sex behind your girlfriend's parents' backs. Good luck with that, dude."
4. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm not sure what's more concerning, the fact that her parents are snooping through her room or the fact that you're trying to convince them to approve of your relationship. As a society, we need to stop shaming people for their sexual choices and start focusing on teaching healthy relationships and boundaries."
5. **RealisticRuth**: "Listen, kid, you're 17. You're not ready for the kind of responsibility that comes with being in a relationship. You're still figuring out who you are and what you want. Take some time to focus on yourself and your own life. You can always try to rekindle things with your girlfriend in the future, but for now, just focus on being a good person and making good choices."

TITLE: I Want to Move Out of State?

POST: Hello everyone. So I am looking to move out of Pennsylvania. I've lived here my whole life. I'm 24 now. Have a job I don't like much. There's not many good jobs around here. I don't have many friends, and lack family (I have one best friend), so nothing is keeping me here anymore. I want to get a fresh start in a new area, where the people are friendly, plenty of job opportunities, and the weather is warm. I was going to go to school for health information management. The program is going to take probably a year to finish and I don't know if I can stay at my current job for that long. However, I don't think it's wise moving out of state with only having data entry and warehouse experience. The states that I was recommended were Texas, North Carolina, and Arizona.

Should I stick it out with my job until I finish school? Have you ever moved out of state because you were unhappy? Was the grass greener on the other side? Please share your experiences =)

TL;DR: I'm 24, want to move out of PA for a fresh start, but don't know if I should stick with my job until I finish school. Any advice?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I moved from PA to AZ a few years ago for a fresh start. It was the best decision I ever made. The weather is amazing, people are friendly, and there are plenty of job opportunities. I was able to find a job in my field (healthcare) within a few months of moving. I would definitely recommend AZ. However, I would suggest waiting until you finish school before making the move. Having a degree in hand will make it easier to find a job and adjust to your new life. Good luck with your decision!"
2. **u/healthcarepro**: "I'm a health information manager and I can attest that it's a great field to be in. I moved from PA to NC a few years ago and it was a great decision. The job market is competitive, but there are plenty of opportunities. I would recommend NC, especially the Raleigh-Durham area. It's a great place to live and the weather is mild. Just make sure you're prepared for the cost of living, which is slightly higher than PA. Good luck with your move!"
3. **u/txnative**: "I'm from Texas and I can tell you that it's a great place to move to. The job market is booming, especially in the healthcare field. I would recommend Austin or Dallas, both of which have a great quality of life. The weather is warm, but not too hot, and the people are friendly. Just be prepared for the traffic and the cost of living, which is slightly higher than PA. Good luck with your decision!"
4. **u/financialfreedom**: "I'm not sure if you should stick with your job until you finish school, but I would suggest building up your savings before making the move. You never know what could happen, and having a financial safety net will give you peace of mind. Also, consider the cost of living in the state you're moving to and make sure you have a plan for housing, food, and other expenses. Good luck with your decision!"

**Common Themes:**

* The importance of having a degree in hand before making a move
* The job market in the healthcare field is competitive, but there are plenty of opportunities
* The cost of living in the state you're moving to should be considered
* Building up your savings before making the move is a good idea
* Researching the area you're moving to and having a plan for housing, food, and other expenses is important

TITLE: I have social anxiety and am doing terribly in interviews. What can i do to improve this?

POST: This has been happening to me a lot lately. I'll get an interview, and the person who has seen my resume tells me right off it looks like my experience is a great match for the position, before we even start. 

(I'm just applying for customer service jobs for the most part, and my resume includes a lot of that, plus some lower management in a customer service job)

Anyway, I do just fine with actual customer service, for some odd reason. 

Outside of work, i don't really have a social life. I'm perfectly comfortable interacting with friends through text, but i rarely see any in person. When i do, i get a bit weird, but that's around people i'm friends with. 

Job interviews though... My mind goes blank. I try to mitigate this problem by researching what the particular company i'm working with uses for interview questions, and preparing and practicing my answers ahead of time. This doesn't work. My mind goes entirely blank, i stumble over words, it's pathetic, and every single time someone has indicated that they definitely want me to work for them based on my resume, by the end of the interview they've changed their mind. 

What can i do about this? I don't have the luxury to just keep practicing and get better, since interviews don't come around that often and i need to actually get a job fairly soon because i'm currently without an income (due to moving to a new area and taking a seasonal job which ended)

TL;DR: I have social anxiety and do terribly in job interviews. I've tried researching and preparing, but it doesn't work. What can I do to improve?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/social_anxiety_warrior**: "Hey, I totally get it. I've been there too. For me, the key was to focus on my strengths and what I can bring to the table, rather than trying to be perfect. Try to relax and be yourself. Remember, they're not looking for a perfect candidate, they're looking for someone who can do the job. Also, consider taking a few deep breaths before the interview, and try to visualize yourself acing it. It might sound silly, but it can help calm your nerves."
2. **u/JobInterviewTips**: "I'm not a therapist, but I've seen a lot of people struggle with social anxiety in interviews. One thing that might help is to prepare a 'launching pad' - a few key points you want to make sure to get across during the interview. This can help you feel more in control and focused. Also, try to find a quiet spot to collect your thoughts before the interview, and take a few deep breaths. And remember, it's okay to take a moment to collect your thoughts before answering a question."
3. **u/AnxietySupport**: "Hey, I just wanted to say that you're not alone. Social anxiety is a real thing, and it's not your fault. I've been there too, and it's tough. But there are people who care and want to help. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your social anxiety? They can help you develop coping strategies and work through your feelings. And don't give up! You got this, and you deserve to find a job that makes you happy."
4. **u/JobSearchAdvice**: "I'm not a therapist, but I've seen a lot of people struggle with social anxiety in interviews. One thing that might help is to focus on the skills and qualifications you have, rather than trying to be perfect. Remember, the interviewer is looking for someone who can do the job, not someone who's perfect. Also, try to find a job that aligns with your strengths and interests, and you'll be more likely to feel confident and prepared. Good luck!"

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Wow, thank you all so much for your responses! I really appreciate the advice and support. I think I'm going to try to focus on my strengths and what I can bring to the table, rather than trying to be perfect. And I'll definitely try to take a few deep breaths before the interview and visualize myself acing it. I'll also try to prepare a 'launching pad' and find a quiet spot to collect my thoughts before the interview. And thank you for reminding me that it's okay to take a moment to collect my thoughts before answering a question. I feel a bit more hopeful now, and I'll keep working on improving my interview skills. Thanks again!"

TITLE: Reddit, am I being unreasonable about situation with friends staying in my house?

POST: So here's the background.  My parents moved out of the country for business (temporary) and left me to live in the house to take care of it.  It's a big house and lonely alone, so I asked if my friends could move in with me.  My parents agreed to friends A and B, but were hesitant about also allowing friends C and D because they did not want that many people living there.  All those friends lived together before, so A and B did not want to ditch C and D.  I managed to convince my parents, and they said fine, but that they would charge everyone $300/mo as rent (which basically just covers utilities).

About 2 months ago, friend A's brother comes over without A telling anyone.  I assumed it was just for a few days, but a few weeks later he was still there sleeping on the couch the whole time.  I asked A and he said he was only staying for the hockey games.  At this point my parents figured out he was here (my brother told them) and were upset that no one asked them if someone else could live there.  I told them the situation and they said fine.  

It is now 3 weeks after the Stanley Cup finals, and he is still here.  My parents are pissed that he is still here and with no definite plans on when he is moving out.  I talked to my friend about it, and he thinks my parents are being unreasonable.  Meanwhile, I'm placed in the middle of it all and am stressing out over the fact that I'm taking shit for this from both sides.  So reddit, am I being unreasonable about this?  Is there a better way I can explain this to him so he gets it?

TL;DR: Friends A and B moved in with me after my parents left, and friend A's brother came over without permission.  He's still here 3 weeks after the Stanley Cup finals, and my parents are upset.  I'm stuck in the middle and feel like I'm being unreasonable for wanting him to leave.  Am I being unreasonable, and how can I explain this to my friend?

TITLE: Me [22M] Not feeling much for my girlfriend, but living with my her [22F] girlfriend and not sure what I can do at this point.

POST: Hello,

I'm a 22 M and have been dating my 22 F girlfriend for about 11 months now. What started off smoldering has really faded out the past few months. She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation/kisses/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation? She honestly does nothing wrong and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that she does for me. I'm just not entirely happy. Any advice?

TL;DR: Living with my girlfriend of 11 months, but not feeling the same level of love and affection as I used to. She's extremely needy and clingy, and I'm starting to see her as more of a great friend. I'm not sure what to do at this point.

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're feeling stuck in a situation where you're not sure what to do. It's normal to feel this way. Have you talked to your girlfriend about how you're feeling? Sometimes just having an open and honest conversation can help clear the air. Also, it might be helpful to identify what specifically is making you feel annoyed. Is it the constant need for affection, or is it something else? Once you can pinpoint the issue, you can start working on finding a solution."
2. **RelationshipExpert**: "OP, it sounds like you're feeling trapped in a situation where you're not sure how to get out. I would recommend having a calm and respectful conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's feeling the same way and doesn't know how to express it. Also, it might be helpful to set some boundaries around your need for space and alone time. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and feelings in a relationship."
3. **ConcernedFriend**: "OP, I'm worried about you. It sounds like you're feeling really unhappy in your relationship, and that's not okay. Have you considered taking a break from each other to figure out what you want and what you need? Sometimes taking a step back can help you gain some clarity. Also, it might be helpful to think about what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. Remember that you deserve to be happy, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs."
4. **BeenThereDoneThat**: "OP, I've been in a similar situation before, and it's not easy. But I would say that it's better to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's okay to admit that you're not feeling the same way as you used to, and it's okay to take some time to figure out what you want. Remember that relationships are about growth and change, and it's okay if things don't stay the same forever. Just be kind and respectful to your girlfriend, and try to communicate openly and honestly."
5. **Newbie**: "OP, I'm new to this subreddit, but I just wanted to say that I'm here for you. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, and that's a tough place to be. I would recommend taking some time to reflect on what you want and what you need in a relationship. It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help."

TITLE: He [22] ended it before it started. I [20F] want to show him it could work.

POST: Hi guys. Need help here. I am an exchange student, and teaching my native tongue to a guy who was considering going for a year abroad in my uni. We...started dating. (This was not even two months ago.) We have wonderful chemistry, he makes me laugh and really started opening up to me. 

Two weeks ago, he started considering other options for his year abroad. Not leaving, for instance. Or another place. And he told me-a few days ago- that he doesn't want to feel pressured to go to my uni because of me. That he had a girlfriend last year who was also an exchange student and that he had made serious plans to follow her, but they ended it and he changed everything at the last minute. He told me "better now than later, trust me"; "the less I see you, the better". 

So, basically, I'm sorry he was hurt. But I really think this could work, and that we could be happy even if only for a while -and I'm trying to work up the courage to tell him, but I need advice : is this even a good idea? Any chance this could work? How can I word it?

TL;DR: He ended it before it started, citing past experience with an exchange student girlfriend. I want to show him it could work, but is it a good idea?

---

This post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide helpful advice and support. The OP (original poster) is seeking guidance on whether it's a good idea to try to convince her partner to reconsider his decision to end their budding relationship.

The community responds with a mix of empathy and practical advice. Some users encourage the OP to respect her partner's decision and move on, while others suggest that she should have an open and honest conversation with him about her feelings.

One user, for example, writes:

"I think it's great that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation with him, but I also think it's important to consider the possibility that he may not be ready to commit to a relationship, especially if he's still processing his past experiences. It might be helpful to have a conversation about what you're looking for in a relationship and what your expectations are, and see if you're on the same page."

Another user adds:

"I think it's important to remember that you can't force someone to stay in a relationship if they're not ready. If he's made up his mind, it's probably best to respect his decision and move on. You deserve someone who is willing to work on the relationship and make it a priority."

Overall, the community provides a supportive and non-judgmental space for the OP to share her feelings and concerns, and offers practical advice on how to navigate the situation.

TITLE: Paying off $24k of debt

POST: Starting a new job on wednesday paying AUD $24.11 p/h + 9.5% super, 8 hrs a day with 30 minute lunch break 5 days a week. Its a call centre job, not cold calling.  We answer queries from customers about their utility bills etc. The contract for this job is for 6 months (probationary). I have been told that i will be offered an extension on the contract after the 6 months as long as i do my job well and not slack off. I also have family friends in company so lets just say that i will have my contract extended for the purpose of my query. Im also looking to do a networking/system administration certification in the upcoming months (which will cost around $2k, give or take). 
I have roughly $21k owing on personal loan with a 7 year repayment period and $3k owing on a credit card. I want to pay these off as quickly as i possibly can. Currently im paying rent on a place i no longer live at until August 23rd at $193 per week, roughly $85 per month for phone bill and $55 per month for something else (up until the 16th of oct). Currently only paying around $58 per month for the credit card (has been stable around this figure for quite sometime so im thinking this is just the card fee as i dont actually purchase anything with the credit card anymore) and $217 for the loan (i think this is monthly). So presuming the credit card fee stays the same, what would be better to pay off first?
Any help with this i am really grateful for.

TL;DR: New job, $24k p/a, 6 month contract, want to pay off $24k of debt ASAP. Currently paying $58/mo on credit card and $217/mo on personal loan. Should I pay off the credit card or the loan first?

---

**Analysis**

The poster is seeking advice on how to prioritize paying off their debt, specifically a personal loan of $21,000 and a credit card with a balance of $3,000. They have a new job that pays $24,111 per year, with a 6-month contract that is likely to be extended. They are considering taking a networking/system administration certification course, which will cost around $2,000.

The poster is currently paying:

* $58 per month on the credit card (which has been stable for some time)
* $217 per month on the personal loan

They are asking whether they should pay off the credit card or the loan first.

**Recommendation**

Based on the information provided, it seems that the poster should prioritize paying off the personal loan first. Here's why:

* The personal loan has a much larger balance than the credit card, and paying it off will free up more money in the long run.
* The credit card balance is relatively small compared to the loan, and the poster is already paying a stable amount each month.
* Paying off the loan first will also help to reduce the overall interest paid over time.

It's also worth considering that the poster may want to allocate some of their income towards saving for the certification course, which will cost around $2,000. However, it's important to prioritize debt repayment first and then focus on saving for the course.

**Additional suggestions**

* The poster may want to consider consolidating their debt into a single loan with a lower interest rate, which could help to simplify their finances and save money on interest.
* They may also want to consider increasing their income by taking on additional hours or a side job, which could help to accelerate their debt repayment.
* It's also important to review their budget and ensure that they are not overspending in any areas, which could be hindering their ability to pay off their debt.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to smell lube out of curiosity

POST: It began when my uncle asked me to help redecorate the house with the new furniture he got from his friend. Being the good nephew I am, I happily obliged.

Now here's where trouble begins. The furniture my uncle's friends gave to us, still had a lot of stuff in them (mostly clothes). So we had to take out the clothes and put them in garbage bags in order for us to use and carry them. Out of sheer luck, I found a bottle of lube.

The labelling on the lube said "**strawberry flavor**". I don't have much experience with sexual things and so I got really curious. I wanted to smell the lube. Yes you read that right. **I WANTED ITS FRUITY SMELL IN MY NOSTRILS**.

Little did I know that water-based lube actually has a very watery-like viscosity. Despite it clearly saying that, I still thought it had a lotion-like viscosity. So opened the cap and tried to squirt a bit into my hand.

Instead, a grand deluge of lube came down all over my body and the furniture--the fruity smell pervasive throughout the vicinity. As this was happening, my entire family stood and watched with mixed expressions of horror and confusion. I told them to relax as it was only water-based lube but my clarification only added to their horror.

They then asked, "Why did you open it?" to which I replied nonchalantly, "I just wanted to smell it."

TL;DR: I TIFU by trying to smell lube out of curiosity and ended up covering myself and the furniture in a fruity-smelling mess.

EDITS: I added a bit more detail to the story and also added the TL;DR for better clarity. I hope this is better. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thank you!

TITLE: A good friend [17 M] became very religious, I [18 M] don't know how to handle it

POST: Hello /r/relationships,
I had a few conversations over the last week with a very good friend of mine that I know for 8 years now. He's an Arab, I'm a Turk.

He always was a chill guy. We would do everything together that was funny, like literally everything. We would go out to smoke waterpipe with another friend. We would talk about anything, we would talk about girls, make fun of things that we would all find funny.

He has changed now, though. No more smoking waterpipe, no more trying to have sex before marriage, no more dating girls as it seems. He talks about why all women should wear scarfs and why they should be capped everywhere on the body. He tells me to stop consuming alcohol. He tells me to stop running after that one girl and rather go learn. He tells me to stop smoking.

He's still kind of chill and responds quiete normally when I ask him about that girl I want to date and get closer to but he also said that if he was me, he'd stop having contact.

He even sent me a video about the Islam and what you should do. I friendly said 'No' and also told him that I respect him for the way he thinks if he thinks that it's the right way but I know for a fact that I won't change and that I'll also go out to smoke with another friend later today.

It's still very strange how he has changed so quick. We would have smoked together like 1-2 months ago and now he just became like that. I don't know how to handle his behaviour. I mean, I don't really think he's going to become an extremist but he seems to be very bullheaded when it comes to religion.

Like I said, I'm a Turk but I take it all easy and also consider continuing to smoke, consume alcohol and having sex before marriage because it's and would all be just part of my life.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: A good friend of mine became very religious and changed his behavior, values and opinions. I don't know how to handle it and I'm worried about losing our friendship.

TITLE: My [18F] girlfriend is starting college and I [19M] over think everything about her safety when I deploy at the end of the year.

POST: So I'm in the Army National Guard and was gone fall semester of my freshman year for training. 
I took classes in spring and now in the summer. I haven't really done the whole college experience and I'm not into that stuff. 
My girlfriend (of 3 years) recently started drinking and partying a lot with just her friends. 
I really despise alcohol due to a long history of alcohol abuse in my family. But If she wants to have a drink with her friends I don't really mind. 

She just had her orientation for college and is telling me know she is planning to attend a lot of frat parties and house parties.
I wouldn't be apposed to going with her to a party because she will do it regardless and I'd feel safer being able to be there. 
The catch is my unit deploys at the end of the year for 10 months. 
My greatest concern with her starting college is that she will drink and something will happen to her or she will do something she'll regret. 
Am I just extremely paranoid. Or am I alright in my concerns. Again I don't know how the college life is I just hear stories from frat guys I work with about the number of drunk girls they have slept with at these parties. 
I love this girl to death and trust her. But she is very inexperienced with alcohol and I fear the worst. Please advise.

TL;DR: Girlfriend starting college, planning to attend frat parties and house parties, I'm concerned about her safety due to my deployment at the end of the year and my history with alcohol abuse in my family.

TITLE: Help! I feel like that crazy girlfriend and know something needs to change.

POST: I am 21F and my boyfriend is 22M. We've been dating for about 9 months now but have been friends for 4+ years. I'm his first girlfriend. 

In my eyes, our relationship is like a wonderful dream. I've been in a long term relationship before (2 years) and it ended fairly amicable, but I know how shitty dating can be. We have so much in common, share wonderful memories and crack up together. We are in love. I'm cynical when it comes to relationships because I've experienced failure after failure, not to mention my parents are divorced. 

We argue, a lot. Over almost anything. Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day. This taints the better part of our relationship, but not enough for either of us to want to end it. Although, we did break up about 5 months ago for maybe a week. (It was a drunken break up)

If I were to describe our relationship from his point of view, you all would probably think I was a psycho. I'm clingy and have a temper. I can be too sensitive and crave attention. Honestly, I hate it, and he knows I hate it. Change isn't easy to come by, and there are some emotional/depression/self esteem issues I should work out on my own.

I guess my question is, how can I change my attitude to be a better girlfriend? Or should we break up for a while so I don't feel so attached to him? I see so much potential in our future together and love him dearly. I just want to make the right choices.

TL;DR: I'm a 21F in a 9-month relationship with my first boyfriend. We argue a lot, and I'm aware I can be clingy and sensitive. I want to change and be a better girlfriend, but I'm not sure how. Should we break up for a while or work through this together?

**Comments:**

* "Girl, you're not alone. I was in a similar situation with my ex. The key is to recognize your patterns and work on changing them. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling and what you need from him. It's okay to admit you're struggling and ask for help. You can't change overnight, but you can start by acknowledging your flaws and working on them."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're not a 'psycho' girlfriend. You're just someone who cares deeply about your partner and wants to make things work. It's normal to have flaws and imperfections in a relationship. The important thing is that you're aware of them and willing to work on them. Don't be so quick to dismiss your feelings and needs. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."
* "I think you should take a break from the relationship for a while. Not because you're a bad girlfriend, but because you need some time to focus on yourself and work on your own issues. You can't change your partner, but you can change yourself. Use this time to work on your self-esteem, depression, and emotional issues. When you come back to the relationship, you'll be a stronger and more confident person, and you'll be able to communicate your needs and boundaries more effectively."
* "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You're already aware of your flaws and are trying to change. That's more than most people can say. Just be patient with yourself and your partner, and remember that relationships are a journey. It's okay to have ups and downs. Don't be so focused on being the 'perfect' girlfriend. Just be yourself and work on being the best version of yourself."

TITLE: I [30F] can't get over my ex [29M], and it's making me physically sick

POST: I feel silly even writing this - I dated my ex nearly two years ago for a while before I moved away. We kept in contact, sexted and met up again last year. It didn't turn into anything more as we were both living in different places, and I was dealing with taking care of my sick mother. He entered into a relationship with someone else following that, which ended in January. Since then, he has again has been in contact with me, texting often, asking if I had moved back in town, and wanting to meet up again when I'm coming to town in a few weeks. We've been really friendly with each other. The thing is, I know he is hooking up with other girls right now, and it makes me really sad. 

I don't want to meet up with him and get hurt, but the thought of never seeing him again is really hard. I can't seem to shake him and I don't know why. I guess we never really fell out of contact so its been hard for me to get over it. I don't why I keep hanging on. He seems able to enjoy time with other girls obviously, but I can't date - just the thought of being with someone else makes me really sad. I try to move on but my heart isn't in it. When I find out through mutual friends of him hooking up with someone, I go to a really low place. I beat myself up, I tell myself I'm not good enough/pretty enough/whatever enough to him, I really hurt myself. 

Since last year, I've lost about 10 lbs just from going through depression and anxiety. I've gotten a really great new job, and things start to look up for me, then I focus back on him and I'm really sad again. I don't want to obsess over him, but I do. I feel I've come off so pathetic still talking to him and carrying this on - I've thought of meeting up with him again but just really don't want to get hurt. Feel like I come off so foolish. Why can't I shake these feelings? How can I stop feeling so unreasonabl hurt over him?

TL;DR: I dated my ex for a while, we kept in touch, and he's now in a relationship with someone else. He still texts me and wants to meet up, but I know he's hooking up with other girls. I'm really sad and can't seem to shake him. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and don't know how to move on. I'm beating myself up over it and it's affecting my physical health.

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like you're still in love with him, and that's okay. But you need to take care of yourself and prioritize your own happiness. Maybe take a break from talking to him and focus on yourself for a bit."
* "I think you're being really hard on yourself. You're not pathetic for still having feelings for him. It's normal to still have feelings for someone you cared about deeply. But you need to focus on yourself and your own happiness. You deserve that."
* "It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of sadness and self-doubt. I would recommend seeking out therapy to help you work through these feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled."
* "I think you need to have a conversation with him about how you're feeling. Be honest with him about your feelings and see how he responds. If he's not willing to work on the relationship or be honest with you, then maybe it's time to move on."
* "You're not alone in this feeling. I've been in a similar situation before and it's hard to move on. But you need to focus on yourself and your own happiness. You deserve that. Take care of yourself and don't be too hard on yourself."

**Subreddit's Response:**

The subreddit community responded with a mix of empathy, advice, and encouragement. Many users acknowledged that it's normal to still have feelings for an ex, but emphasized the importance of prioritizing one's own happiness and well-being. Some users suggested seeking therapy to work through the emotions, while others encouraged the OP to have an open and honest conversation with their ex about their feelings. The community also reminded the OP that they are not alone in this feeling and that it's okay to take time to process their emotions. Overall, the response was supportive and non-judgmental, with a focus on helping the OP move forward and find happiness.

TITLE: I need some relationship advice :(

POST: i am having a confusing relationship with my ex-boyfriend. We had a neutral break-up, and agreed to stay as friends. The cause of the break-up was that, he felt that he was tied-down, and wanted more freedom as we are both just in our teens. I've tried to change his mind, but he was persistent. So right now, we are just suppose to be friends, and I'm okay with that. But now that we are not in a relationship, he treats me really well, and sometimes when we are alone, he will kiss me and hug me. He still shows that he really cares for me and likes me a lot still, but in front of his friends, he is a bit cold to me. I'm really confused, what should I do? Does he still like me more than a friend?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend and I had a neutral break-up, agreed to stay friends, but he still shows affection towards me, but is cold in front of his friends. I'm confused about his feelings.

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "It sounds like he's still got feelings for you, but is trying to play it cool in front of his friends. The fact that he's still showing affection towards you, but not in front of others, suggests that he's not ready to fully let go of the relationship. You need to decide if you're okay with being in this limbo situation or if you want to have a real conversation with him about your feelings."
2. **u/relationship_guru**: "It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and his behavior. It's possible that he's trying to keep the door open for a potential reconnection in the future, but it's also possible that he's just not ready to fully commit to being friends. You need to consider what you want from this friendship and whether you're comfortable with the mixed signals he's sending. Maybe have a conversation with him about how you're feeling and see where it takes you."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm going to be real, it sounds like he's just not over you and is trying to keep you on the hook. He's not ready to fully let go of the relationship, and that's not fair to you. You deserve someone who is willing to be honest with you and respect your boundaries. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this friendship is really what you want. You deserve better than someone who is still playing games with your emotions."
4. **u/romantic_at_heart**: "I think it's sweet that he still cares for you, but you need to be honest with yourself about whether you're ready to get back into a relationship with him. If you're not, then it's okay to set boundaries and let him know that you appreciate his friendship, but you're not interested in rekindling anything romantic. Remember, your feelings and well-being are important, and you shouldn't settle for someone who is not willing to respect your boundaries."

---

**Conclusion:**

The top comments on this post offer a range of perspectives and advice, from encouraging the OP to have an open conversation with her ex-boyfriend to suggesting that she may need to re-evaluate the friendship and set boundaries. The comments highlight the importance of considering one's own feelings and boundaries in a situation like this, and the need to be honest with oneself about whether one is ready to rekindle a romantic relationship. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but the comments provide a helpful starting point for her to consider her options and think critically about her feelings.

TITLE: Is it worth starting a relationship with a good friend [22, M] if I [22, F] know ahead of time our end goals are different?

POST: I met my friend in college a little over a year ago. The first night we hung out, we stayed up talking almost all night. We started hanging out more regularly (never anything sexual though), and then we graduated. I haven't seen him in person since then because we live far away. 

However, we text and Skype frequently. Skype conversations are never shorter than 2 hours and often last up to 4. Basically, we really understand each other and like each other's company. Seeing each other in the future is not completely out of the question... currently we live very far away but he wants to move closer to where I live for a number of reasons. And we'll be going on vacation together in a couple months. 

Both of us are recently single and craving both physical and emotional connection. But here's the thing: he is very, very opposed to having children in the future. I, on the other hand, want kids. It's completely irrelevant right now, but I'm wondering if it's even worth pursuing if I know our end goals are so different. I don't want to have to persuade him to change his mind about such a serious life decision.

TL;DR: I have a close friend who I've known for over a year, and we've been talking about potentially starting a relationship. We get along great, but we have very different end goals (he doesn't want kids, I do). Should I pursue this relationship knowing our goals are so different?

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's worth having an open and honest conversation about your goals and expectations. It's better to know now rather than later down the line. You can't change someone's mind, but you can decide if you're willing to compromise or if it's not worth it to you."
* "I think you should consider what's more important to you - the potential relationship or the potential kids. If you're willing to compromise on the kids, then maybe it's worth exploring. But if having kids is non-negotiable for you, then it might be better to just stay friends."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about what you really want. Do you want a relationship with someone who is willing to compromise on having kids, or do you want someone who shares your goals? It's okay to prioritize what's important to you and not settle for something that doesn't align with your values."
* "I think it's worth considering the possibility that your friend might change his mind in the future. People's priorities and goals can change over time. But if you're not willing to compromise, then it might be better to just stay friends."
* "I think you should have a conversation with your friend about your goals and expectations. It's better to be upfront and honest than to assume you're on the same page. You can't force someone to change their mind, but you can decide if you're willing to compromise or if it's not worth it to you."

Overall, the comments suggest that it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about your goals and expectations. It's better to know now rather than later down the line, and it's okay to prioritize what's important to you and not settle for something that doesn't align with your values. Some people suggest that it's worth considering the possibility that your friend might change his mind in the future, but others think that it's better to just stay friends if you're not willing to compromise.

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 2 years. We live together and he has made a huge decision he just expects me to be OK with.

POST: SO my boyfriend and I have been living together, for 6 months now. We both work in the food industry and hes planning on going back to school in 2 weeks. 

A little background on our jobs, its important to our disagreement. I am a salary manager in a very popular corporation and he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. 

Well, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of "breaking his fucking hand" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks. 

Now I wouldnt mind so much if we were in a better economic state. I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. 

Now we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying "things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal".  
We also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. 

My question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 2 years just quit his job after being accused of stealing and is planning to go back to school. I'm worried about our financial situation and our apartment, but he's not taking my concerns seriously and thinks I'm not supporting him. Am I overreacting?

**Comments:**

* "I think you're being reasonable to be concerned about your financial situation. It's not just about your boyfriend's decision, it's about the impact it will have on your life together. You have a right to express your concerns and work together to find a solution."
* "I think you're being too harsh on your boyfriend. He's making a big change and it's natural to be uncertain. Try to have a more open and supportive conversation with him instead of attacking him for his decision."
* "I'm a bit surprised you're not more supportive of your boyfriend's decision to go back to school. It's a big step and he's taking a risk to pursue his education. Maybe try to see the bigger picture and understand why he's making this change."
* "I think you're overreacting a bit. Your boyfriend is taking a risk, but it's not like he's leaving you or abandoning you. You're in this together, and you should be supporting each other through the tough times."
* "I think you should have a calm and rational conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Instead of accusing him of not believing in him, try to understand his perspective and work together to find a solution. Remember, you're a team and you should be supporting each other."

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thank you all for your comments. I think I was being a bit too harsh and not listening to my boyfriend's perspective. I'm going to try to have a more open and supportive conversation with him about my concerns. I still have some reservations, but I want to work together to find a solution. Thanks for the advice!"

TITLE: How do I (f35) stay interested in my partner (m42) while he's away for extended periods of time?

POST: My partner and I have been together for over a year, living together for 2 months. He is a professor so he gets summers off to go work on his service and research. I love him dearly, and I am very much into him when we are together.

However, when he is gone longer than a week (and this summer he's been gone 3 weeks so far), I just kind of lose interest. Not in a way that I want to see other people, I just lose any kind of bond we have. This may be in part because we are terrible at keeping up with each other when we are apart.

I visited him for a few days about 1.5 weeks ago, and it was perfect. It takes a day or two to reestablish our connection, but it was wonderful. He's going to be gone a month longer with no visit. I don't know how to keep it up without being totally estranged when he returns. 

I'm not angry with him, I don't want to break up. I just feel... apathetic? Like he's just a distant person who resides in my home. I don't know how to explain it other than apathy. I don't want to feel this way about him.

TL;DR: My partner is away for extended periods, and I lose interest in him when he's gone. How do I stay connected and maintain our bond when we're apart?

COMMENTS:

* "Have you guys talked about how you can stay connected when he's away? Maybe set up regular video calls or something?"
* "I'm a professor's partner too, and I totally get it. It's tough to maintain a connection when you're not physically together. Have you considered scheduling regular phone calls or video chats? It might help you feel more connected."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work on it. Maybe try sending him little notes or messages throughout the day to keep him on your mind. It's the thought that counts, not the grand gestures."
* "I'm a bit of a introvert, and when my partner is away, I tend to get a bit withdrawn too. Maybe try doing something you both enjoy, like watching a show or playing a game, and then when he gets back, you can pick up where you left off."
* "I think it's normal to feel apathetic when your partner is away for extended periods. It's not that you don't love them, it's just that you're not getting the same level of interaction and intimacy. Maybe try to focus on the things you do love about him, and the things you're looking forward to when he gets back."
* "Have you considered setting up a shared online calendar or something? That way you can both stay on the same page and feel more connected even when you're apart."
* "I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and wanting to work on it. Maybe try to focus on the things you're grateful for about your partner, and the things you're looking forward to when he gets back. It might help shift your perspective a bit."
* "I'm a bit of a romantic, and I think it's sweet that you're feeling apathetic. Maybe try to surprise him with little gestures or gifts when he gets back. It might help rekindle the spark and make you feel more connected."

This post and the comments that follow offer a range of advice and perspectives on how to stay connected with a partner when they are away for extended periods. Some suggestions include:

* Scheduling regular video calls or phone calls to stay in touch
* Sending little notes or messages throughout the day to keep each other on each other's minds
* Doing something you both enjoy together, even if it's just watching a show or playing a game, to keep the connection alive
* Focusing on the things you love and are grateful for about each other
* Setting up a shared online calendar to stay on the same page and feel more connected
* Surprising each other with little gestures or gifts when you're apart

Overall, the comments suggest that it's normal to feel apathetic when your partner is away for extended periods, but that there are ways to work on maintaining the connection and staying interested in each other.

TITLE: What's the most badass thing your mother or father has ever done?

POST: My father used to live in Chicago. He owned a furniture store. There was a large business across the street, and the business didn't have very good parking. So, this one employee would always park in my father's parking lot.

My father asked him everyday for a week to please stop parking there, because it took parking spots away from his customers.

On the first 4 days the guy says "yah, sure. I won't park here."

On the 5th day, the guy says, "Fuck off! This is a free country!"

So, my dad waits for the guy to park in his lot again the following Monday.

The guy parks in my father's parking lot, flips him off, and then storms to the business across the street.

So, my father being the natural badass he was, sprays water all over the car. Keep in mind this is in CHICAGO. In the FUCKING WINTER.

When the guy comes out from work a few hours later, he finds my dad standing there with a hose, smoking a cigarette, with the douchebag's car almost completely frozen.

The guy flips his shit and tells my dad he's calling the cops, and my father just says nonchalantly "It's a free country, isn't it?".

The douchebag's car was frozen in my father's parking lot for the rest of the winter. It was actually in the news, but I can't seem to find it on the internet, considering it happened in like the 60's.

Needless to say, the following spring, the guy didn't park his car in my father's parking lot.

TL;DR: My dad owned a furniture store in Chicago. A guy kept parking in his lot, so my dad sprayed water all over the car, freezing it in place for the rest of the winter. The guy was furious, but my dad just shrugged and said it was a free country. The car stayed frozen until spring, and the guy never parked there again.

COMMENTS:

* "That's amazing! I love the part where he just shrugs and says it's a free country. What a legend."
* "I love how he didn't even get in trouble for it. He just outsmarted the guy and got away with it."
* "I can just imagine the look on the guy's face when he saw his car frozen in place. Priceless."
* "I'm surprised the guy didn't try to sue him or something. But I guess when you're outsmarted by a badass like your dad, you just have to admit defeat."
* "I'm going to have to tell this story to my kids one day. It's a great example of how to stand up for yourself without resorting to violence."
* "I love the part where he's smoking a cigarette while he's doing it. That's just the epitome of cool."
* "I'm surprised the news didn't pick up on this story. It's definitely newsworthy. Maybe it was a local paper or something."
* "I'm going to have to ask my dad about this story. I bet he's got some other good ones like this."  SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit

TITLE: I [M 21] dont know how to convey to a girl that I like her and want more than a friendship.

POST: Basically my issue is that I'm terrible at telling someone I'm interested in them in ways more than a friend. I'm not sure what it is or why it happens per say, but I just cannot break that barrier. I'm great at forming long lasting friendships but they form due to my interest in the girl as more than friends. 

As stupid as it sounds, I quite literally get "stuck" in the "friendzone" as a result of my own inability to act on my feelings and tell the other party I am interested in more ways than just friendship. 

Lately I've been wondering if this is just something I personally deal with or if its common. Any help/advice/tips/changes I can make to myself/my perception would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm 21, terrible at telling someone I'm interested in them beyond friendship, and it's causing me to get stuck in the "friendzone". Help?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've been in similar situations before and it's super frustrating. For me, it helped to take a step back and think about what I wanted from the friendship. Was it just a friendship or was there something more? Once I figured that out, it was easier for me to have the conversation. Also, try to be genuine and authentic in your approach. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have feelings you don't really have. Just be yourself and be honest. Good luck!"
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, it's not uncommon for people to struggle with expressing their feelings, especially if they're not used to it. One thing that might help is to practice having these conversations with friends or family members. It can help you build confidence and get comfortable with expressing your emotions. Also, try to focus on the positive aspects of the friendship and how it's grown over time. This can help you feel more confident and less anxious about taking the next step. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know the other person better before making a move. Good luck!"
3. **u/awkwardturtle**: "OP, I'm right there with you. I've been stuck in the friendzone for years and it's super frustrating. One thing that might help is to try to find common ground with the girl. Is there something you both enjoy doing or a shared interest? Use that as a conversation starter and see where it takes you. Also, try to be patient and don't put too much pressure on the situation. It's okay if things don't work out, but at least you'll know you tried. Good luck, OP!"
4. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. It's okay to take your time and figure things out. The most important thing is to be genuine and respectful in your approach. Don't try to rush things or force something that's not meant to be. Just be yourself, be kind, and see where things go. Good luck, OP!"

TITLE: I don't feel like my wife [32/f] can be emotionally intimate with me [32/m]. Can we get there? If so, how?

POST: I'm [32/m] a pretty intimate person with my friends, strangers, and family. I tend to overshare easily, introspect often, and have no problem connecting with other people who are like me very quickly and on a deep level. 

Unfortunately, that doesn't include my wife [32/f]. She comes from a closed family and doesn't easily open up. This manifests itself in all aspects of her life. She's wary of sharing details with strangers, tends to talk about basic things with me, and is quite bored/ uninterested in sex. But most of all, I have been nagged for years by the feeling that we don't have a "spark" - an emotional connection that makes me want to do everything for her. 

I have got to the point where what we have feels increasingly like a friendship rather than a deep emotional relationship. I have suggested that I'm not willing to be in a relationship that's not fulfilling emotionally and have told her that I have considered a separation. 

Our therapist thinks that my wife needs to get better in touch with her sexuality in order to open up more, but I'm not sure. That feels like treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. I think the problem is deeper than just sex. I think she's not able to be intimate emotionally with me. 

I know that stereotypically, it's the guy who can't be emotionally intimate and the girl who seeks it. But I just wonder, is emotional intimacy something that one can "learn to do"? Or is she just likely to always have a hard time opening up? And finally, is lack of emotional intimacy grounds to divorce someone?

TL;DR: I feel like my wife and I don't have an emotional connection, and I'm not sure if it's something she can learn to do or if it's just her nature. I'm considering separation/divorce if we can't work on this.

**Top Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think it's great that you're acknowledging the issue and willing to work on it. Emotional intimacy is definitely something that can be learned and developed with effort and communication. It's not just about being open and sharing personal things, but also about actively listening and being present for each other. Have you tried having open and honest conversations with your wife about how you're feeling and what you need from her? It might be helpful to identify specific instances where you felt disconnected and work on building on those moments."
2. **relationship_expert**: "I agree with the therapist that exploring your wife's sexuality could be a helpful step in building emotional intimacy. However, it's also important to recognize that emotional intimacy is not solely dependent on sexual intimacy. It's about creating a sense of safety, trust, and vulnerability with each other. Have you tried doing activities together that allow for deeper conversations and bonding, such as couples' therapy, journaling, or sharing personal goals and aspirations? These can help create a sense of emotional closeness and intimacy."
3. **honesty_is_best**: "I think you're being too focused on your wife's lack of emotional intimacy and not enough on your own role in the relationship. Have you considered that your need for emotional intimacy might be overwhelming or even suffocating for your wife? Sometimes people need space and time to process their emotions, and it's not necessarily a lack of emotional intimacy that's the issue. I would suggest taking a step back and reflecting on your own emotional needs and boundaries before pushing your wife to open up more."
4. **romantic_at_heart**: "I think it's beautiful that you're willing to work on this and that you're not giving up on your relationship. Emotional intimacy is something that can be developed and nurtured over time with effort and commitment. I would suggest doing things that bring you both joy and closeness, like cooking dinner together, taking a weekend getaway, or practicing mindfulness and meditation together. These can help create a sense of connection and intimacy that goes beyond just physical intimacy."
5. **realistic_view**: "I think you need to be realistic about the situation. If your wife is not willing to work on building emotional intimacy and you're not willing to accept the relationship as it is, then it might be time to consider separation or divorce. It's not fair to expect someone to change who they are fundamentally, and it's not healthy to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for you. I would suggest having a honest conversation with your wife about your needs and expectations and seeing if there's any willingness to work on the relationship. If not, it might be time to re-evaluate your priorities and consider what's best for you."

TITLE: The new guy I'm seeing [24/m] likes to sit on the same side of the table as me [20/f]. Weird or cute?

POST: I've been seeing this guy now for about a month or so (note: we're both in our 20s), and when we go out to eat he likes to sit on the same side of the table. Personally, I think it's cute; most of the other guys that I've dated have never done this. When I asked him why he likes to sit on the same side of the table he said he feels its more romantic. However, my friends think it's weird. They say it's normal for being out in a group to sit next to your SO, but not while out to eat alone together. I don't want to be judged at restaurants, but at the same time I don't see what the big deal is. Since this has become somewhat of a debate, I thought I'd ask Reddit! What do you all think? And if you all think it is  weird, how should I explain this to my new man?

TL;DR: New guy I'm seeing likes to sit on the same side of the table as me when we're out to eat. My friends think it's weird, but I think it's cute. What do you all think?

* "I'm a guy and I have to say, I've never thought about sitting on the same side of the table as my partner before. But if it makes you happy, then that's all that matters. Maybe you can explain to your friends that it's just a quirk and not a big deal?" (56 upvotes)
* "I think it's a bit weird, but not in a bad way. It's just something that's not common, so it stands out. If you're okay with it, then that's all that matters.

**Subreddit discussion:**

The discussion on r/relationships is lively, with many users sharing their own experiences and opinions on the matter. Some users think it's cute and romantic, while others find it weird or awkward. There are also some users who suggest that it might be a sign of insecurity or possessiveness on the part of the new guy.

One user shares a similar experience: "I used to date a guy who would always sit next to me on the couch, even when we were watching TV or playing games. At first, I thought it was cute, but eventually it started to feel suffocating. I think it's important to communicate with your partner about what makes you comfortable and what doesn't."

Another user suggests that the new guy might be trying to recreate a sense of intimacy or closeness: "Maybe he's trying to recreate the feeling of being in a relationship, like when you're holding hands or cuddling on the couch. It's not necessarily about being weird or awkward, but about trying to create a sense of closeness and connection."

The discussion continues, with users sharing their own thoughts and experiences on the matter. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to sit on the same side of the table as your partner is up to each individual, and it's important to communicate with your partner about what makes you comfortable and what doesn't.

TITLE: Don't try to tell me what I can't do.

POST: Earlier this year, I applied for a summer job at my university. It paid decently but allowed me to take classes offline, which I preferred to do, so I went for it. At the same time, a friend of mine (we'll call him Jack) was applying for the job.

Jack became a dick about the job really quickly. Told me I wasn't really qualified (even though I'd been working for the department this job came through for a year) and that my customer service skills were lacking (even though he's seen my boss praise them). Needless to say, I was unhappy and pride mode went into overdrive.

Originally, my plan was to go in and just talk about what I knew and how I could be of service. But his lack of faith made me step it up a notch. I talked to people who had the job in the past. I did research on the people hiring me. I even went to one of the old hirers to get some tips. I was running at 110%.

Interviews end and we find out the results. I got the job. Jack didn't. I went to go talk to him about it but was pulled aside by my friend first, who showed me tweets Jack made saying I was cocky and didn't deserve the job. His reasoning was that I said I wish I knew if I got the job sooner than the date we were expected to, because I just wanted to know so I could get on with my life and stop stressing. He took it as me thinking I got the job.

Knowing about the tweets (I don't use Twitter), I decided to be the lesser man in the situation. At this time, Jack and I were roommates. I walked it and he was quiet. Obviously pissed at me. So I go next door to our friend's room and just shouted "[FRIEND] I GOT THE JOB! I'M SO EXCITED!" The walls of our dorm were small. I know he heard me. Walked back in and he just glared at me, but I didn't care. He was a dick.

TL;DR: Got a job, Jack didn't. He was a dick about it, so I got petty and made sure he knew I got the job. I'm proud of myself.

---

**Comments:**

* "Lol, petty revenge is the best kind of revenge. Congrats on the job!"
* "I love how you didn't let his negativity get to you and just went for it. You got the job and proved him wrong. Good for you!"
* "I'm dying over here. 'I'M SO EXCITED!' I can just imagine the look on his face"
* "You know what they say, 'if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen'. Jack got burned and it's hilarious"
* "I'm impressed by your ability to stay calm and not let him get to you. You're a better person than I am"

**Score:** 12,000 upvotes

**Note:** The post has been edited to remove some of the more explicit language and to make it more family-friendly. The original post had some stronger language and more details about the situation. The post has been well-received by the community, with many users praising the OP's ability to stay calm and not let Jack's negativity get to them. The post has also sparked a lot of discussion about the importance of staying positive and not letting others bring you down.

TITLE: Broke up over a month ago. Still bummed out sometimes. Advice?

POST: Hey guys,
 My SO broke up with me over a month ago. The first week has been hard but I got over it. Problem is that from time to time I still think about it and it really bums me out.

Tonight, I randomly started thinking about the offer of having sex that she gave me 5 days ago to which I declined. I think it was a good decision for the both of us but I might have been a little harsh by saying "it would be weird to hook up again". In some twisted way, I might have said that to convince myself I'm over her.

I don't want to get back together because of the long distance, her inability to express emotions, her controlling and her manipulation of the insatisfaction of her own truth but I still have the remainder of some feelings.

TL;DR: Broke up over a month ago, still have feelings, sometimes bummed out, advice?

---

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey, it's normal to still have feelings after a breakup, especially if it was a long-term relationship. It's like your brain is still processing the emotions and trying to make sense of everything. As for the sex offer, it's good that you declined it. It's not worth risking your emotional well-being for a physical connection. You did the right thing by being honest with yourself and your ex. Just remember that you deserve someone who loves and respects you for who you are, not someone who tries to manipulate you."
2. **u/BreakUpBae**: "I'm so sorry to hear that you're still feeling bummed out. It's tough to get over someone, especially when they were a big part of your life. But you're doing the right thing by acknowledging your feelings and not trying to suppress them. It's okay to take time to grieve the loss of the relationship and to process your emotions. Just remember that you're strong and capable, and you will get through this. You might want to try talking to a therapist or a trusted friend or family member about your feelings. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to who can offer support and guidance."
3. **u/ExperiencedBreakUp**: "Hey, I went through a similar situation a few years ago. It took me a while to get over my ex, but I eventually did. One thing that helped me was to focus on myself and my own well-being. I started taking care of my physical and mental health, and I started doing things that brought me joy and fulfillment. I also made an effort to surround myself with positive people who supported me and made me feel good about myself. It's not easy, but it's worth it. You will get through this, and you will come out stronger on the other side."
4. **u/SupportiveSoul**: "Hey, I just wanted to say that you're doing great. It's not easy to go through a breakup, especially when it's a long-term relationship. But you're taking the time to process your emotions and to focus on yourself, and that's amazing. Just remember that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you. You will get through this, and you will come out stronger and wiser on the other side. Keep being kind to yourself and taking care of yourself, and you'll be just fine."

TITLE: My [24f] BF [28M] of three months only wants to hang out 1-2x a week, which means we only have sex once a week. I need more. What do I do?

POST: BF and I have been dating for a few months. at first we hung out all the time and had sex every day, sometimes twice a day.
For the past two months we've been hanging Out less and less. Probably 1-2x a week max now. Usually if we hang out a second time it's with other people so we don't have sex, meaning that we've been having sex literally once a week.

I can't really handle it. I need it 3-4 days a week ideally. I've told him before that he can hit me up for sex whenever but he has never done that. We also used to have sexy convos by text all the time but now we basically never do. I finally told him some time back that I want to start doing that again and he agreed but we haven't. A few times I've tried to start something naughty over text and he didn't really go for it.

I think the big problem is just not hanging out enough, but I don't think he wants a relationship where we're seeing each other every other day.

TL;DR: BF and I used to hang out and have sex a lot, but now we only hang out 1-2x a week and have sex once a week. I need more. What do I do?

COMMENT 1:
Hey OP, I'm a guy and I've been in similar situations before. I think you need to have an open and honest conversation with your BF about your needs. Tell him how you're feeling and what you need from the relationship. It's possible that he's not aware of how you're feeling or that he's not prioritizing the relationship like you are.

Also, try to avoid blaming or accusing language. Instead of saying "you never want to have sex" or "you're not making an effort," try saying "I feel like we're not connecting as much as we used to and I'm feeling a little lonely. Can we find a way to make more time for each other?"

Remember, relationships are about compromise and communication. It's okay if you don't agree on everything, but it's important to find a middle ground that works for both of you.

COMMENT 2:
I'm a woman and I've been in a similar situation before. I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If your BF is only willing to hang out 1-2x a week and have sex once a week, that's not a healthy or fulfilling relationship for you.

You deserve better than that. You deserve a partner who is willing to prioritize your needs and make an effort to connect with you on a regular basis. If your BF is not willing to do that, then maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is right for you.

Remember, you are worth so much more than a relationship that is only half-hearted. You deserve someone who is all in, 100% of the time.

COMMENT 3:
I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're not going to find someone who wants to have sex 3-4 times a week. That's not a normal or healthy relationship. You need to find someone who is willing to compromise and meet you halfway.

Also, maybe you're putting too much pressure on your BF. He's not going to want to have sex every day, and that's okay. You need to learn to accept that and find other ways to connect with him.

Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and find ways to make it work. You don't need to have sex every day to be happy in a relationship. You can find other ways to connect and bond with your partner.

COMMENT 4:
I think you're being a bit too focused on the sex aspect of your relationship. While it's important to have a healthy sex life, it's not the only thing that matters in a relationship.

You need to focus on building a connection with your BF on a deeper level. Try to have more meaningful conversations with him, and find other ways to connect and bond. You don't need to have sex every day to be happy in a relationship.

Also, maybe you're putting too much pressure on your BF. He's not going to want to have sex every day, and that's okay. You need to learn to accept that and find other ways to connect with him.

Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and find ways to make it work. You don't need to have sex every day to be happy in a relationship. You can find other ways to connect and bond with your partner.

TITLE: TIFU by peeing

POST: Happened just now. I happily skip up the stairs, getting ready to head to bed. I brush my teeth and then feel the sudden urge to pee. I drop trou and let it go, spraying my urine all in the toilet.

Midway through, as I was about to go no hands, I see a spider crawling up the toilet roll. I panic, and jolt backwards, making my urine go all over the place. Then, with my baby maker out, stir dripping my urine, I grab the nearest deadly thing to banish this monstrosity. Air freshner. 

I spray it as it crawls away. Then I lost it. So I pulled my trousers back up and ran. I'll clean the floor when that bastard is dead.

TL;DR: I peed, saw a spider, panicked, and then sprayed air freshener at it. Now I'm in a state of panic and I don't know what to do.

COMMENT 1: Dude, you're a real-life action hero! Who needs a cape when you've got air freshener?

COMMENT 2: I think you might want to reevaluate your priorities. The spider is probably just trying to make a living, and your urine is probably not the most effective way to kill it.

COMMENT 3: I'm just glad you didn't try to use the air freshener as a makeshift sword. That would have been a real mess.

COMMENT 4: You know what they say: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. When life gives you spiders, make... um, spider-ade?

COMMENT 5: I think you might want to consider getting a new hobby. This whole "spraying air freshener at spiders" thing is getting a little old.

COMMENT 6: I'm just impressed that you managed to get your trousers back on while still in a state of panic. That's some impressive multitasking right there.

COMMENT 7: You know what they say: when you're in a tight spot, just remember that you can always count on air freshener to save the day.

COMMENT 8: I think you might want to consider getting a new toilet. That spider was probably just trying to make a home in the toilet roll, and your urine was probably just making it harder for it to survive.

COMMENT 9: I'm just glad you didn't try to use the air freshener as a makeshift shield. That would have been a real mess.

COMMENT 10: You know what they say: when life gives you spiders, make... um, spider-ade? Yeah, that's it. Spider-ade. It's a thing. I'm pretty sure.

TITLE: First relationship [19M] with my GF [19F], been going out for 3 months - what do we do now?

POST: Ok, so first off let me just say that things are going great. We've been on dates, we hang out loads and we genuinely really really like each other (maybe even love?).

Up till now, everything sorta felt like we've been climbing up this relationship ladder, but right now it seems like, short of marriage and children, we're as high up as we can be. I guess what I'm trying to ask is - what do we do now?

Do we just keep on going as things are (it's definitely not stale yet btw) or what? I guess maybe I also don't know how much time I should try to spend with her coz I don't wanna come across as too needy (sounds stupid I know). Basically I'm just a bit confused about what to do with our relationship at this point. Any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)

TL;DR: Been dating my GF for 3 months, things are great, but I'm unsure what to do next. Should we just keep going or try something new? How much time should I spend with her without being too needy?

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're just looking for a new challenge or something to spice things up. Why not try something new together? Take a weekend trip, try a new hobby, or even just have a game night with some friends. It's not about being needy, it's about keeping things fresh and exciting."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just enjoy the ride and see where things go. You're not married yet, so don't put too much pressure on it. Just relax and have fun with each other."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the 'what's next' aspect. Why not just focus on the present moment and enjoy each other's company? You don't need to be doing something 'new' all the time. Sometimes just hanging out and being together is enough."
* "I think you're being a bit too needy. You're 19, for crying out loud! You don't need to be spending every waking moment with your girlfriend. Take some time for yourself, pursue your own interests, and come back to her when you're ready. Trust me, she'll appreciate the space."
* "I think you're just feeling a bit bored or restless. Why not try to mix things up a bit? Plan a surprise date, take her on a spontaneous trip, or even just surprise her with a small gift. It's the thought that counts, not the grand gesture."

This post and its comments demonstrate a common phenomenon in relationships: the desire for novelty and excitement. The OP is unsure what to do next and is looking for suggestions on how to keep the relationship fresh and exciting. The comments offer a range of perspectives, from encouraging the OP to try new things together to advising them to focus on the present moment and enjoy each other's company. Some comments also caution against being too needy or putting too much pressure on the relationship. Overall, the post and comments highlight the importance of communication and flexibility in relationships.

TITLE: My [18 M] girlfriend [18 F] of a year and I decided to break up for college about 5 days ago. I think I want to try long distance.

POST: We had been dating for a year, things we're going well but she was always a very flirty person. I developed trust issues because of her being so flirty so when we went to different colleges I pushed for a breakup.

She had been 100% willing to try and make long distance work, but I just couldn't get over my doubts. After a week apart, I realized I would always regret not at least trying to make things work, so I decided I'd try to get her back. I looked up a train route to her university, found a fancy pizza place(it's her favorite), and an ice skating rink in her area.

I called her up that night, spilled my heart out and asked if she'd take me back. I explained that if she said yes, I'd take her on the best date of her life, and if she said no that she should know I'd still feel way better than I had been.

She told me that first I needed to know that the previous Friday she had a drunken one night stand attempting to get over me. She said she regretted it and that it meant nothing, but it crushed me. I thought the worst she could say was no, but this was far worse.

It had literally been days after our breakup, we had been talking the entire time, we had even said that we loved each other the night before. I still love her, but I don't know if I could ever forgive her. I know it wasn't really cheating because we didn't have a title, but it was like the first opportunity she had, she left me behind.

I'm extremely emotional and distraught right now and I don't know what to tell her. Any advice/comments would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My girlfriend of a year and I broke up 5 days ago due to me having trust issues. I realized I wanted to try long distance and asked her to take me back, but she confessed to having a drunken one night stand with someone else. I'm torn between my love for her and my anger and hurt.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. It sounds like you're going through a lot of emotions right now. I think you need to take some time to process everything and figure out what you really want. Forgiveness is a process, and it's not something that happens overnight. You need to think about whether you can truly move past this and if you're willing to work through the issues that led to the one night stand."
* "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but it sounds like your girlfriend made a huge mistake. I'm not saying it's unforgivable, but it's definitely a major red flag. You need to think about whether you're willing to take her back and work through the issues that led to this. If you do decide to take her back, make sure you set some clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship moving forward."
* "I think you need to take a step back and think about what you really want. Are you willing to forgive her and move forward, or do you need some space and time to figure out what you want? Either way, you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of the relationship."
* "I'm not sure what to say, but I do think you need to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what happened. You need to know why she did it and what she's willing to do to make it right. You also need to think about whether you're willing to work through the issues that led to this and whether you're willing to take her back. It's not an easy decision, but it's one you need to make for yourself."
* "I think you need to take some time to think about what you really want and what you're willing to do to make it happen. Are you willing to forgive her and move forward, or do you need some space and time to figure out what you want? Either way, you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of the relationship." (x2)

**Original Poster's Response:**

* "Thanks for all the comments, guys. I think I'm going to take some time to think about everything and figure out what I really want. I know I'm still in love with her, but I'm also really hurt and angry. I need to make sure I'm making the right decision for myself, not just for the relationship. Thanks again for all the advice and support." (x2)

TITLE: A serious communication problem between me[M21] and my girlfriend[F19]. Am I being an asshole to her?Or something else?

POST: My gf and I have been dating for more than 1.5 year and were friends for more than 3 years. I know a lot about her and she does the same about me. She's a really great person. I could spend the whole day describing how much I like her and how much I am lucky to be with her. But there's an issue in our relationship that I can't get over or keep up with. The issue is her crying during the majority of serious/heated conversations. When we strongly disagree on something and struggle to reach an agreement, I try to calm down, explain my opinion more precisely and ask more questions about the parts that I don't understand about her opinion, but instead of doing the same as I do, she starts getting frustrated, and cries. Reasonably it's the end of the talking, but for her it's not. She asks me to stay and listen to her expressing her frustration about the situation and me not agreeing with her (while she continues crying) instead of calmly discussing the actual problem.  

Yesterday I tried to talk her about her crying problem and how her actions are unproductive in solving anything without hurting her feelings, but I apparently couldn't. She shifted the blame on me and accused me of not caring about her and not want to spend time with her. She stormed out of the house. Now it has been 24 hours since our fight. I called her at least three times but she didn't answer my calls. She probably staying at her parents' house.

TL;DR: My girlfriend cries during serious conversations and I'm trying to address the issue, but she shifts the blame on me and accuses me of not caring about her.

QUESTIONS:

1. Am I being an asshole to her?
2. Is there something else going on that I'm not aware of?
3. How can I approach this situation to resolve it?

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "You're not being an asshole. It sounds like you're trying to have a productive conversation, but she's not willing to listen. It's possible that she's not aware of how her behavior is affecting you, but it's not okay to shift the blame on you. You should try to have a calm conversation with her about how her crying is making you feel and how you'd like to have a more constructive conversation."
2. **u/relationship_advisor**: "It sounds like there's a power imbalance in your relationship. You're trying to have a rational conversation, but she's using emotional manipulation to get what she wants. You need to set clear boundaries and communicate your needs to her. It's not about not caring about her, it's about not wanting to engage in a conversation that's not productive."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you're being too logical about this. Sometimes people just need to express their emotions, and it's not always about being productive. Maybe try to understand where she's coming from and validate her feelings before trying to 'fix' the problem. You can still have a constructive conversation without dismissing her emotions."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thank you all for your comments. I think I was being too logical about this, and I need to understand where she's coming from. I'll try to validate her feelings and have a more empathetic conversation with her. I'll also make sure to set clear boundaries and communicate my needs to her. I appreciate your help and advice."

TITLE: My [21/F] husband [23/M] is always on his phone, getting me super irritated. Advice?

POST: (Sorry if this is rambly, I'm just super annoyed!)!My husband (24) and I [21/F] have been together 5 years. Lately, he has been really irritating me lately with his excessive phone use, and it's starting to get under my skin! He is constantly on his phone, either playing his stupid game or on Facebook or God knows what else. 

We have a 1 year old son, and it's gotten to the point where he'll sit on the couch and play on his goddamn phone while my son tries to play with him. And it's ALL night. I am mainly the one playing and taking care of our son. He wasn't this bad before, he would put his phone down while our son was awake, but lately it doesn't matter.. I rarely have my phone. My son is usually throwing it around or it's on the floor. I only really use it when my son is napping or at night when my son is in bed. I DONT want to be one of those parents who's always on their phone, that's why I rarely have it on me when my son is awake. Plus, he's a handful enough already lol. Anyway, my husband is really irritating me with his phone use. And sometimes he can get a little weird with me touching it too. it always has to be in his reach. It's starting to make me wonder if maybe he's doing more than being on FB :-/ 

Ive tried talking to him so many times about it. I've tried to talk to him about it nicely, and not so nicely. I bring up my concerns, but he usually stops for a couple hours or maybe one day, than goes right back. Tonight, I told him to please get off his phone and help with J (our son, he has a really bad cold) and he got mad, tossed his phone and just sat there and was all mad. It's getting ridiculous and I don't know what else to do.

TL;DR: My husband is always on his phone, even when our son is awake, and it's really irritating me. I've tried talking to him about it, but he doesn't seem to care. I'm starting to wonder if he's doing something he shouldn't be.

**Reddit's Response:**

1. **ConcernedRedditor**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your husband is really struggling with phone addiction. Have you considered talking to him about how his phone use is affecting you and your relationship? Maybe try framing it as a concern for your relationship rather than just a personal annoyance. Also, have you tried setting boundaries around phone use in your home? Like, designating phone-free zones or times?"
2. **SkepticalSarah**: "OP, I'm not sure I buy the whole 'he's addicted to his phone' thing. Maybe he's just really stressed or overwhelmed and using his phone as a coping mechanism. Have you talked to him about what's going on in his life that's causing him to be so glued to his phone? Maybe there's something going on that you're not aware of."
3. **ExperiencedEx**: "OP, I've been in a similar situation with my partner, and it was really tough. But I think what helped was setting clear boundaries and consequences for when those boundaries were broken. For example, we agreed that during dinner time, all phones had to be put away. If someone broke that rule, the other person got to choose the activity for the rest of the evening. It took some time, but eventually, my partner started to prioritize our time together over his phone use."
4. **ConcernedCounselor**: "OP, I'm a therapist, and I have to say, it sounds like you're experiencing some pretty significant frustration and resentment towards your husband. Have you considered couples therapy to work through these issues? It might be helpful to have a neutral third party facilitate some conversations and help you both work through your feelings and concerns."
5. **RealisticRedditor**: "OP, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it sounds like your husband is really struggling with phone addiction. But, let's be real, it's not just about the phone. It's about the underlying issues that are driving his behavior. If you're not willing to work on those issues with him, then it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. Sorry to be harsh, but sometimes the truth hurts."

---

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Phone addiction is a real issue that can affect relationships.
2. Setting boundaries and consequences can help address phone addiction.
3. Communication and empathy are key to resolving conflicts related to phone use.
4. Couples therapy can be a helpful resource for working through issues related to phone use.
5. It's essential to consider the underlying issues driving phone addiction and address them in a relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by telling a tinder girl she didn't have to shave

POST: Been on tinder lately. Well i matched with a girl that looked decent and had potential. We talked for awhile over the app and then she decided to come over. She had asked me if it was ok that she hadnt shaved, now i am a mature adult so a little bit of hair is no big deal. She shows up, not quite as good as her pictures which is typical, and sounds pretty manly. We hang for a bit and then start getting into it. I reached in and felt bush but that doesnt bother me anyway so everything is good. Eventually her pants come off and now i see why she said she didnt shave. Her pubes ended around her knees and i could smell her. I tried to muster through, trying to avoid hurting her self-esteem by asking her to leave or stopping. I eventually got it up by thinking happy thoughts and covered my jimmie, went for a few minutes and then she wanted to get on top. When she did so i was forced to view the garden and went limp. I said that i had to pee before and thats maybe my problem, it wasn't, so i went into the bathroom and started getting myself hard again, fake flushed the toilet and rushed out to get back in there. Again within a few minutes i was soft again. At this point i decided to tell her that i have this problem if i have jacked off recently and told her i did an hour before to last longer, not an actual problem for me i promise, and told her that i probably wont be able to finish and eventually sent her on her way. Hopped in the shower and cleaned the smell off of me.

TL;DR: TIFU by telling a tinder girl she didn't have to shave, then got turned off by her pubic hair and had to fake a bathroom break to get away from her.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're a real winner. You're complaining about a little bit of pubic hair and then you're trying to fake a bathroom break to get away from her? What's next, are you gonna tell her she's too fat or something?"
* "I'm not saying it's okay to judge someone based on their appearance, but come on, dude, you're on tinder. You're looking for a hookup, not a long-term relationship. If you're not comfortable with a little bit of hair, then maybe you should be looking for someone else."
* "I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that you managed to get a girl to come over or the fact that you managed to fake a bathroom break to get away from her. Either way, you're a real champ."
* "Dude, you're a total creep. You're complaining about a little bit of hair and then you're trying to fake a bathroom break to get away from her? That's not okay. You need to take a hard look at yourself and figure out why you're so uncomfortable with a little bit of hair."
* "I'm not saying it's okay to judge someone based on their appearance, but come on, dude, you're on tinder. You're looking for a hookup, not a long-term relationship. If you're not comfortable with a little bit of hair, then maybe you should be looking for someone else." (again, because it's that good)

TITLE: 18 month old daughter consistently screams for 1-4 hours every night at bedtime. HELP!

POST: My daughter has been screaming for 2 hours so please bare with me as I try to articulate how I feel and what is going on. 

I am 30 weeks pregnant and essentially a single mom ( husband is in the oil field). I really need to be able to sleep!

My daughter has always been a handful at bedtime to say the least. I have tried later bedtimes, comforting every 15, 20,  45, 60 minutes and it only fuels her tantrums more. I  currently doing the 'cry it out' method but haven't been able to stick with it for more than a few days on the past. 

I feel awful just leaving her cry herself to sleep ( when it works). I don't want her to have lasting issues because she thinks no one loves her. 

She has always had a very consistent bedtime routine. I have always prided myself on that. Her actual sleeping habits are straight from hell, since the day she was born. 

Her routine:
Supper: 530-6
Bath: 630-7
Quiet time: books, a tv show 
Teeth, new diaper
Bed: 8-830
Scream: 8-12

The only part in her routine that has ever changed is the hour we put her to bed and it has only changed once from 730, that was 8 months ago. 

She has never consistently slept through the night, she doesn't sleep past 6 ever...even if she doesn't fall asleep until midnight.

TL;DR: 18 month old daughter screams for 1-4 hours every night at bedtime, I've tried various methods, feeling awful and desperate for help.

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're doing everything right, but it's not working. Have you considered talking to a pediatrician or a sleep consultant? They may be able to help you identify the underlying cause of her screaming and provide some personalized advice."
* "I've been in your shoes before. I tried the 'cry it out' method, but it didn't work for me either. I ended up using a combination of white noise and swaddling to help my daughter sleep. You might want to try that. Also, have you considered using a sleep sack or a weighted blanket? Some kids really respond well to the pressure and comfort they provide."
* "I'm not a sleep expert, but I do know that 18 months is a big age for kids. They're going through a lot of changes and can be really resistant to sleep. Have you tried making some changes to her bedtime routine? Maybe try a different book or a different TV show before bed. Sometimes, kids just need a little something to help them wind down."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're doing everything right, but it's not working. Have you considered talking to a therapist? Sometimes, kids can pick up on our stress and anxiety, and it can affect their behavior. Maybe a therapist can help you and your daughter work through some of these issues."

TITLE: TIFU by not wanting to be late for work.

POST: I work midnights at a gas station so I'm the only one there on most nights. Meaning I cannot afford to be late or the person I'm replacing not only gets pissed off but can risk going over on hours (god forbidden the damn place pays them an extra dollar for not clocking out on time). While getting ready with about 10mins until I had to leave I had the need to shit. And I of course made the mistake of deciding to hold it until after work (hence why I'm posting here). 
Luckily this is not a "I shit my pants" story, I was able to make it to work and a few hours in my shift with mild discomfort but no huge problems. It was around 3am and very slow (we stop selling beer at 1am so after that its dead). I decided now was the prefect time to take my shit. About 5mins into it I heard the door ring... FUCK...
It was the point of no return though, they could wait a few minutes. Then I heard the dreaded "HELLO IS ANYONE HERE?!" I quickly finished up and came out. It was my bosses 20yr old spoiled bitchy brat. Fuck everything. She makes a hugeass deal out of it saying she was waiting for 10 minutes (which is bullshit) and that "My mother will hear about this". She's the kind of person that overreacts to everything and hopefully my manager will understand that... Hopefully

TL;DR: Held in a shit for 10 minutes, took it at work, and got caught by my boss's 20yr old brat. Now I'm worried about getting in trouble.

TITLE: I [23M] feel disconnected from my three-year-long relationship with my [25F] gf.

POST: I apologise in advance but this will be a long one.

Over the last few months, I feel as though I'm just a passenger in my relationship with my 25 y/o gf.

We have been together for three years, but aren't living together yet - because our job situations don't lend themselves to moving in. We have discussed it and we would like to when the time is right. (I'm in an entry-level position with opportunities to move in six to twelve months time and she has just secured a management job in a retail store.)

I feel disconnected from her because of how she has been when we communicate.

We came back from a two-week vacation a month ago - the holiday was great. But since we have come back it's as if she's not making much of an effort for our relationship.

Beforehand we used to text each other romantic/lovey things all the time. Now if I ask her to send me a 'nice' text she puts something generic or says she doesn't know what to put because she doesn't want to repeat herself - repeating herself would be hard to do because she doesn't say things in the first place.

One example - last night I told her I really wanted to have sex with her and her reply was along the lines of lol really?

Our sex life isn't great. The last time we did was on holiday - so just over a month ago. I saw her at the weekend and we had planned to do stuff but she wanted to watch films instead and then before we realised it I had to take her home.

Should I be worried about this lack of intimacy, or is it a common occurrence in relationships which have been this long?

TL;DR: I feel disconnected from my three-year-long relationship with my 25 y/o gf. We used to be very romantic and intimate, but since we got back from holiday, she's been distant and uninterested in our relationship. Should I be worried?

---

**Comments:**

* "It sounds like she's going through a phase, but it's been a month and it's not just a phase. You need to have a real conversation with her about how you're feeling. Tell her how her lack of effort is affecting you and ask her what's going on. Don't assume it's just a phase, it could be a sign of something deeper."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the romantic/lovey texts. It's great that you guys used to do that, but it's not the only thing that matters in a relationship. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? Maybe she's just stressed with work or something and doesn't know how to prioritize your relationship right now."
* "I think you're being a bit too clingy. You guys have been together for three years, it's normal for things to slow down a bit. Maybe she's just not feeling it right now and that's okay. You don't have to be in a constant state of romance to be happy in a relationship. Just relax and see how things go."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your relationship. If you're not getting the intimacy and affection you need, maybe it's time to re-prioritize your relationship or consider moving on. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."
* "I think you should try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. But also try to understand where she's coming from. Maybe she's going through a tough time and doesn't know how to express her feelings. Try to be patient and understanding, but also don't be afraid to set boundaries and communicate your needs."

TITLE: TIFU by screaming at a random lady on the phone at work

POST: So, this happened yesterday and I didn't have time to write out until now. A little background – I work for a call center that reviews car insurance policies, mostly for the renewals; we do both inbound and outbound calling. I also have the wonderful privilege of working from home. I have 2 cats and a 10-month old German Shepherd/Lab mix puppy, the latter I usually keep with me in my home office to separate her from terrorizing the cats while I'm trying to work.

There I am, working like normal. Pup decides it's a good time to be real annoying and jump everywhere, making dumb puppy noises. Now, all of our calls are recorded and we are "coached" on 5 calls per week. These are just weekly reviews of 5 supposedly random calls that we are graded on by our managers. I must do well in order to keep my status of no pants, lay in bed all day work flow, or just keep my job in general (cuss words would get me fired.)

Anyway, here she is going nuts and then an outbound call pops up. I introduce myself and begin explaining the reason for my call, whilst fighting off this 80lb demon dog child, and right as I'm done with my introductory spiel, I press the mute button on my headset and yell, in my angriest dad voice, "GO LAYYYYYYY DOOOOOOWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!!!!" She saunters off and I direct my attention back to the call, looking down to press the mute back off and noticing that in fact, the mute button had not been pressed and I just told this random lady to go lay down after asking about her car insurance. I heard an "Uhhhhh…." on the line and promptly hung up in my embarrassed and anxious panic after the damage was done.

If this call gets "randomly" selected to be reviewed this week, I could be in some deep shit.

TL;DR: I yelled at a random lady on the phone while working from home, telling her to go lay down, and then hung up on her. I'm worried about getting in trouble. Has this ever happened to you? How did you handle it? Help me out, fellow Redditors! 

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're a hero. I would have done the same thing. I mean, who doesn't love a good 'GO LAY DOWN' every now and then?"
* "I'm dying over here. I can just imagine the look on her face. Did you get a chance to apologize before hanging up?"
* "I've had my fair share of TIFU moments, but this one takes the cake. I hope you get a good laugh out of it and that your manager has a sense of humor."
* "I'm a little concerned about the puppy's well-being. Is she okay? Did she get in trouble for being a little too rambunctious?"
* "I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. Just remember, it's all about the delivery. You could've said it with a smile and a wink, and it would've been a great call."
* "I'm a little worried about you, dude. You might want to consider getting some help for that anger issue. Just saying."
* "I think you should frame that call and put it on your wall. It's a masterpiece. 'GO LAY DOWN' – the ultimate call center move."
* "I'm a manager at a call center, and I can tell you that this kind of thing happens more often than you'd think. Just be honest about what happened, apologize, and move on. It's not the end of the world."

TITLE: How do I [19/F] find self-worth in the dull relationship I have with my partner? [25/M]

POST: We've been together for over 2 years, but just lately things haven't been great. As soon as we get home, the TV's on, laptop's are on and we barely speak a word to each other. Without sounding harsh, I feel that I genuinely make all the effort, but he's not so interested.

For example, I'll start up a conversation, and he quite literally stares at the TV and won't respond. When I tell him I would like a response and I'm wondering if he heard me, he says he "has nothing to say". I don't interrogate him, I just talk about different topics I have in mind!

And then he says we'll go out for a walk together, go to the beach etc and when the day comes to do these things, he ends up telling me he doesn't want to. 

I have depression, panic attacks and my dad passed away end of last year so I'm not in a position where I feel overly confident about myself. If he looks at the TV whilst I'm talking to him, I take it to heart. When he spends more time making plans with his friends than he does with me, it really hurts me. 

He knows all of this, and that I've put him on a pedestal because he's all I have right now. I've put college, Uni and my passion for travelling on permanent hold because those things weren't going in the same direction as he was, and he knows this.

Is he taking advantage of the fact he knows he can get away with an easy life because I'll never leave? To me, he's a genuinely sensitive and loving person, but I think he favours doing things the easy way and making life as comfortable for himself as possible. How do I resolve all of this?

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old girl in a 2-year relationship with a 25-year-old guy. We've been having issues lately, and I feel like I'm making all the effort, but he's not reciprocating. I have depression, panic attacks, and my dad passed away recently. I'm struggling to find self-worth in this relationship. How do I resolve this?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into the relationship and not getting much back. I think you need to have a serious talk with your partner about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're not getting the attention and affection you need from him and that it's affecting your mental health. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel seen and heard. Don't settle for someone who doesn't make an effort to communicate with you."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're putting a lot of pressure on this relationship and expecting your partner to be everything to you. You need to focus on building your own self-worth and confidence. Take some time for yourself, pursue your passions, and surround yourself with positive people. You don't need your partner to complete you. You are enough, regardless of whether you're in a relationship or not."
3. **u/sadgirl23**: "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're in a toxic relationship. You deserve so much better than someone who doesn't make an effort to communicate with you. I think you should take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. You don't need someone who doesn't appreciate you. You are worthy of love and respect, and you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel seen and heard."
4. **u/relationshipcoach**: "OP, I think you're in a situation where you're stuck in a pattern of behavior that's not serving you. You're putting all your energy into the relationship and expecting your partner to change. But the truth is, you can't change someone else. You need to focus on changing yourself and your own behavior. Start by setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected."

**Conclusion:** The comments on this post are a mix of advice and support. Some commenters suggest that the OP needs to have a serious talk with her partner about how she's feeling and set boundaries, while others encourage her to focus on building her own self-worth and confidence. Some commenters even suggest that the relationship may be toxic and that the OP deserves better. Overall, the comments are trying to help the OP find a way to resolve the issues in her relationship and improve her mental health.

TITLE: Reddit can pull some great advice out of almost anything, what can you say about my life?

POST: I'm a seventeen year old going into grade twelve, and I don't know anything about my future... I really don't know where I'm going career-wise. That's one thing; I also have a girlfriend of 2+ years and we have yet to kiss, I haven't gotten even my learner's license yet, and throughout my life I have refused to use any drugs/alcohol to this point.

Now, I've been really satisfied with all this untill today, when an old friend and I got together and met up with our third friend (who turns out to now smoke weed/is now on a two month light-every-day streak). This lead to a messed up day of following them to dealers and near fights, small town gangs and free kijiji kittens, all leading to getting some friends together to light up.

I did nothing but follow and listen to them today, and what an average day for any one of them amazed me. I left and thought about my current life, and now I'm here on askreddit while laying in bed.

Basically, I want to know how normal I am.

TL;DR: 17 year old, unsure about future, never kissed girlfriend, no license, never used drugs/alcohol, but had a wild day following friends who do and now questioning my life choices.

TITLE: I (20F) think I want to break up with live in boyfriend (20M) of two years.. not sure how to do it

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, and living together since we were together around 6 months. 
Everything was awesome, we rarely fought and there has rarely been any huge issues aside from a few times I've come across him text messaging other women inappropriate things, which he apologized for and I forgave him, etc. (I'm surprised i did, i have serious trust issues)

Now, lately, I've been feeling very upset and frustrated, and generally unhappy.

I feel as though I need to be on my own, I want to travel and explore and do all kinds of things that he's not interested in. I find myself thinking things like "if I was single I'd go do this" or "if I became single again I'd go here or try this" & I'm realising that if I ever want to do those things, it likely won't be while I'm with him.

But, here's the hard part - I have no idea if he feels the same way - he knows something is wrong because I've completely shut down over the weekend, my mind is so jumbled and I'm so confused that I didn't eat anything yesterday so I'm obviously not feeling well. Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.

Don't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore. I feel held back, trapped! I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..

So what I need is advice - How do I do it? We live together so this will be incredibly hard... I'm so scared to break his heart, I'm scared he'll get angry. I'm terrible at confrontation, so i'll likely break down and be bawling before I even get any words out...

Please help :(

TL;DR: I've been feeling unhappy and trapped in my 2-year relationship, I want to break up but I'm scared of hurting my boyfriend and I don't know how to do it since we live together. I'm seeking advice on how to approach this conversation and what to expect.

**Top comments:**

1. "I think you're doing the right thing by acknowledging your feelings and considering the breakup. It's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21F] has been incredibly controlling lately, what should I [19F] do?

POST: I have been with my girlfriend for 1 year and a half, and I love her dearly. I truly believe she is my soulmate and that I will spend the rest of my life with her. However, she has been incredibly controlling lately and I don't know what to do about it. 

She goes to college about 2- 2 1/2 hours away from where I go to college, so I see her when she comes home on weekends. When she's up at school, she has to know where I am, and if I'm not in my room doing homework, she's mad that I'm not talking to her. If I'm with my friends at all she gets very angry because I could instead be talking to her. And by talking to her, she means like Skype. I text and snapchat her pretty regularly when with friends. She will claim I am making her depressed and anxious, and will be very distant toward me if I don't talk to her the night prior. The most ridiculous thing she's done in regards to control is telling me she drank and drove the night before because I wasn't talking to her so she wanted to spite me. 

I told her if she doesn't stop I will break up with her. She told me she couldn't and within 5 minutes she called me and begged for me to come back to her house because she would do everything in her power to fix it. 

According to her, this controlling thing is because she has severe anxiety. She is so insecure and anxious, so craves my attention to reassure her. Though this may sound like bullshit, she legitimately does have really bad anxiety and gets panic attacks very frequently.  She claims once she comes home from school (she graduates in a month) that she won't feel this way anymore because then we will be in the same city. 

I love her to death and don't want to break up, but this situation is stressing me quite a lot. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has been controlling, wants to know where I am and who I'm with, gets mad if I'm not talking to her, claims it's because of her anxiety and insecurity. She says she'll stop once we're in the same city, but I'm unsure if I should wait or break up.

RESPONSES:

1. **RedFlag**: OP, you're being gaslit. Your girlfriend is using her anxiety as an excuse to control you, and it's not okay. You deserve better. Don't wait for her to "fix" her anxiety, because it's not your responsibility to fix her. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries. 
2. **Concerned**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your girlfriend is using her anxiety as a way to manipulate you. You need to have a serious conversation with her about how her behavior is affecting you. Tell her that you love her, but you can't continue in a relationship where you feel controlled and anxious. If she's truly committed to working on her anxiety, she'll understand and respect your boundaries. 
3. **RealTalk**: OP, let's be real, your girlfriend is not going to magically "fix" her anxiety just because you're in the same city. You need to take a step back and re-evaluate this relationship. You deserve to be with someone who respects your boundaries and doesn't try to control you. Don't wait for her to "change" – you need to prioritize your own happiness. 
4. **Supportive**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like your girlfriend is struggling with anxiety, and it's not okay for her to use that as an excuse to control you. However, it's also important to acknowledge that she's trying to cope with her anxiety in her own way. Maybe try having a conversation with her about how her behavior is affecting you, and see if you can find a compromise. Remember that you deserve to be respected and loved, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice your own happiness for someone else's anxiety. 

This post and responses highlight the complexities of relationships, particularly those involving anxiety and control. The OP is torn between their love for their girlfriend and the stress caused by her controlling behavior. The responses offer a range of perspectives, from concern and support to red flags and tough love. Ultimately, the OP must decide what is best for their own emotional well-being and whether the relationship is sustainable.

TITLE: What are some signs that a woman is emotionally unavailable?

POST: I've been dating a woman for a few months now, and I've started to notice some red flags that make me wonder if she's emotionally unavailable. She's always busy, never wants to talk about her feelings, and gets defensive when I try to have a deep conversation. She also doesn't seem to care about my feelings or needs, and always prioritizes her own desires. 

I've tried to have open and honest conversations with her about these issues, but she just brushes them off and tells me I'm being too sensitive. I'm starting to feel like I'm not getting the emotional connection I need from her, and I'm worried that she might not be capable of giving it to me. 

Can anyone offer some insight or advice on what signs to look out for in a woman who might be emotionally unavailable? 

TL;DR: Dating a woman who seems emotionally unavailable, always busy, defensive, and prioritizes her own desires. She brushes off concerns about emotional connection. What signs should I look out for?

RESPONSES:

1. **RedFlag**: OP, it sounds like you're already seeing some major red flags. Emotional unavailability can manifest in many ways, but some common signs include: avoiding intimacy, being overly critical, prioritizing work or other activities over relationships, and being dismissive of your feelings. If you're feeling like you're not getting the emotional connection you need, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship. 
2. **Empathetic**: OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It can be really tough to recognize the signs of emotional unavailability, especially when you're invested in the relationship. Remember that emotional unavailability is not a personal failing – it's often a result of past trauma, attachment issues, or other factors. If you're willing to work on the relationship, you might consider seeking couples therapy to address these issues. 
3. **RealTalk**: OP, let's be real, if she's consistently prioritizing her own desires over your needs and feelings, that's a major red flag. Emotional unavailability is not just about being busy or defensive – it's about a fundamental lack of emotional investment in the relationship. If you're not getting the emotional connection you need, it's time

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my boyfriend [18 M] of 9 months, He loves me, I said I do too, now I don't know if I still do?

POST: Wanna keep details brief: Both guys, been together for around 9 months now. Somewhere around 4 months in we start saying "I love you", and at the time I assumed I really did because I've never been in love before.

Things have developed and he often says how madly in love with me he is, but I don't feel I can say the same back, heck I don't think I really do love him.

Don't get me wrong, he is AMAZING and I really think he's the nicest guy around, and this relationship is awesome. I want us to still be in a relationship but I can't honestly say I love him, and he's started noticing I don't reply "I love you too".

How can I go back on what I said in the past AND STILL keep this relationship?

TL;DR: 19M, 9 months with boyfriend, said "I love you" back, but now I don't feel the same way. How to keep relationship without lying?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it's better to be honest with him. You can't keep pretending to feel something you don't. Have a conversation with him about how you're feeling. It might be uncomfortable, but it's better to be honest than to continue lying."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "You don't have to say 'I love you' back if you don't mean it. You can say something like 'I really care about you and value our relationship, but I don't feel the same way about love.' It's okay to have different feelings, and it's better to be honest than to pretend."
3. **u/itsokaytofeelconfused**: "It's normal to feel confused about your feelings, especially if you've been in a relationship for a while. Take some time to reflect on what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and see where it takes you."
4. **u/communicationiskey**: "Communication is key in any relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. It might be uncomfortable, but it's better to be honest than to continue lying or pretending."
5. **u/relationshipgoals**: "You don't have to be in love to be in a healthy and happy relationship. You can still care deeply for someone and value your relationship without feeling romantic love. It's okay to have different feelings, and it's better to be honest than to pretend."

TITLE: So unfortunately I turned in 3 huge assignments on friday RIGHT after the teacher left...

POST: So last week, I had 3 huge assignments due for one of my teachers. These assignments have made the past week pretty much one of the most stressful weeks of my life, and I didn't even finish until Friday just about when school ended. When I went to go to her to turn it in, it turns out she had health problems and checked out 30 minutes before class ended, leaving me in what I would call an FML state of mind. I rushed to the library and emailed my teacher as soon as possible explaining the situation... but so far she hasn't responded. And it's Sunday. I'm worried sick, Reddit, and I have no idea what I should do. Surely she must understand and not flunk me just because I barely missed her leaving her class... but I'm in doubt. What should I do?

TL;DR: I turned in 3 huge assignments on Friday just as the teacher left, and I'm worried she'll flunk me because I missed the deadline. I emailed her explaining the situation, but she hasn't responded yet. What should I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Don't worry, it's not the end of the world. Just follow up with an email or a phone call to confirm she received your email and to apologize again for the inconvenience. If she's still not responding, you could try talking to the school administration or a guidance counselor for advice."
2. **u/throwaway321456**: "I'd suggest sending a follow-up email with a polite and apologetic tone, reiterating the situation and expressing your willingness to make it up to her if needed. You could also offer to meet with her during office hours or after school to discuss the assignments and any potential issues."
3. **u/throwaway789012**: "I'd be more concerned about the quality of the work rather than the timing. Make sure you proofread and double-check your assignments for any errors or omissions. If you're confident in your work, then you can relax and wait for her response. If you're still worried, consider talking to a guidance counselor or the school administration for advice."
4. **u/throwaway456789**: "It's possible that your teacher is dealing with personal issues and hasn't had a chance to respond yet. Give her some time, and if you're still worried, try sending a follow-up email or making a polite phone call to check in. Remember to stay calm and professional, and try not to jump to conclusions."
5. **u/throwaway123456**: "I'd suggest keeping a record of all your communications with your teacher, including emails and any phone calls or meetings. This will help you track any progress and provide evidence if needed. Also, try to stay positive and focus on your strengths rather than worrying about the outcome."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is worried about being flunked due to missing the deadline, but the top comments suggest that they should follow up with an email or phone call to confirm the teacher received their email and apologize again for the inconvenience. They should also consider sending a follow-up email with a polite and apologetic tone, reiterating the situation and expressing their willingness to make it up to the teacher if needed. Additionally, they should focus on the quality of their work and try to stay calm and professional. The comments also suggest that the teacher may be dealing with personal issues and hasn't had a chance to respond yet, so it's important to give them some time and not jump to conclusions. Overall, the OP should try to stay positive and focus on their strengths rather than worrying about the outcome.

TITLE: I (f20) think I'm in an emotional relationship with my friend (m20). I don't know how I should handle this.

POST: I have a really close friend who is a guy. We've been friends for 2 years and we're neighbors who spend most of our weeknights together. He is honestly one of the greatest people I know-- I trust him with my life. We're moving in together (platonic) in a few weeks in a new city and we're both extremely excited, but I'm nervous about our relationship.

People tease us already that we're dating and his mom is convinced that we're together. We usually just deny it and laugh it off, but I feel like there's some subtext that we're not addressing. We'll playfully tease each other or he'll tickle me randomly when we're hanging out; we're pretty touchy/cuddly with each other but nothing over the top or scandalous. We talk about everything and I feel it's safe to say we're best friends. 

There have been moments where I've wanted to kiss him and be relationship cuddly, but there's always been something holding me back. Like, I can't picture having sex with him at all (not that he's unattractive, I just literally can't see it). I want/can picture kissing him, but the second I try and imagine something more sexual, I can't.  

Futhermore, I can't say I'm too thrilled about him getting a girlfriend either. It's not like I'd ever sabotage anything for him, but I'm not too keen on the idea of sharing him or spending less time with him. I know that mindset is unhealthy, so I'm trying my best to keep it under wraps. 

I'm afraid I'm in an emotional relationship with him and I'm concerned about what might happen when we move in together. Any advice or opinion would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old woman who thinks I might be in an emotional relationship with my 20-year-old male friend. We're moving in together and I'm worried about what might happen. I'm unsure if I'm ready for a romantic relationship with him, but I'm also not sure if I'm ready to give him up as a friend. Help! 

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're being really honest with yourself about your feelings. It's okay to admit that you're unsure about what you want. Have you talked to your friend about how you're feeling? Maybe it's time to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and see where he stands."
2. **u/relationshipguru**: "OP, it sounds like you're experiencing some mixed signals. On one hand, you're attracted to your friend and enjoy his company, but on the other hand, you're not sure if you're ready for a romantic relationship with him. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. It might also be helpful to have a conversation with your friend about your feelings and see if you're on the same page."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "OP, I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're not in a romantic relationship with your friend, you're just really close friends. You're worried about what might happen when you move in together, but that's just because you're nervous about change. Take a deep breath and remember that you're friends, and that's okay. You don't have to label everything or make it more complicated than it needs to be."
4. **u/honest_honesty**: "OP, I think you're being really honest with yourself, and that's awesome. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're unsure about our feelings. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you want and what you're willing to compromise on. It might also be helpful to have a conversation with your friend about your feelings and see if you're on the same page. Remember, it's okay to take things slow and figure things out as you go."

TITLE: My ex (27f) and I (27m) mutually broke up about a week ago and she is already trying to find a new relationship

POST: My ex and I were in a relationship for one year. We now discovered many differences between us and decided to stop our relationship (in a rather negative way, i.e. big fight). She said that she got nothing from this relationship and wondered why she got involved with me in the first place.

One week later, she posted on fb that she is looking for a new relationship. And I feel very sad about that. Although our relationship was troublesome toward the end, it has its moments that I still cherish. I did care about her and wanted to be with her while I was in a relationship with her. But it seemed like she did not feel the same way. Her wanting a new relationship so quickly hurts my feelings because our relationship appeared not to be that meaningful to her.

* Was what she has done right? or was she being inconsiderate/insensitive?
* Am I supposed to be feeling like this? Am I too needy/clingy?
* How should I cope with this?
* I'm still "friends" with her on fb, should I just remove her? I little part in me still wants to go back to her so I don't really want to cut all connections to her.

If you could be the judge and analyze my situation and provide some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. I can give more information in the comment if needed.

TL;DR: My ex and I broke up a week ago. She is already looking for a new relationship and it hurts my feelings. Was she right to do so? Am I being too needy? How should I cope with this? Should I remove her from my fb friends list?

---

**Analysis and Feedback**

The OP's situation is a common one, where the ex is moving on quickly, leaving the OP feeling hurt and uncertain about their own emotions. Here's a breakdown of the situation and some feedback:

**Was what she has done right? or was she being inconsiderate/insensitive?**

It's understandable that the OP feels hurt by their ex's actions. While it's not uncommon for people to move on quickly after a breakup, it's also important to consider the timing and manner in which they're doing so. In this case, the OP's ex is already looking for a new relationship, which may be perceived as insensitive or inconsiderate, especially given the recent nature of their breakup.

**Am I supposed to be feeling like this? Am I too needy/clingy?**

It's normal to feel hurt and upset after a breakup, especially when it's a recent and significant one. The OP's feelings are valid, and it's not necessarily about being too needy or clingy. It's about the emotional investment they had in the relationship and the sense of loss that comes with its end.

**How should I cope with this?**

Coping with this situation will likely involve a combination of self-reflection, emotional processing, and boundary-setting. Here are some suggestions:

1. Allow yourself to feel your emotions: It's okay to feel hurt, angry, or sad. Acknowledge and accept these emotions, and give yourself permission to process them.
2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends and family.
3. Set boundaries: Consider removing your ex from your social media friends list or limiting your interactions with them. This can help you maintain emotional distance and focus on your own healing.
4. Focus on yourself: Use this time to reflect on your own needs, desires, and goals. What do you want to achieve in your life? What kind of relationships do you want to have in the future?
5. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist for emotional support and guidance.

**Should I remove her from my fb friends list?**

It's ultimately up to you whether you want to remove your ex from your social media friends list. If you feel that seeing her posts or updates is causing you distress or making it difficult for you to move on, it may be helpful to remove her. However, if you're able to maintain a healthy distance and not feel overwhelmed by her presence, you may choose to keep her as a friend.

Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness in any relationship, including a breakup. It's okay to take time to process your emotions and focus on your own healing. With time and support, you can move forward and find a more fulfilling relationship in the future.

SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining

TITLE: Tried to teach my dog to play dead. Instead gave him a complex.

POST: A few months back, I was reading up on how to teach your dog to play dead.  The whole guiding him onto his back with a treat, then reinforcing with praise and reward.  I figured I'd give it a shot.

So I get home from work and get down to business.  Ozzy's catching on pretty quickly.  Within 10 minutes, I have him rolling onto his back on command.  I was pointing my finger at him and saying, "BANG!" as a cue.  Suddenly though, as he's lying on his back, he pees a little.  (In my excitement to teach him a new trick, I forgot to let him out to pee!)  He's obviously ashamed of himself, even though I didn't get mad at him as it was my fault.

After we've cleaned up and gone out for a pee break, I attempt the trick again.  Point my finger at him and say "BANG".  Ozzy tucks his ears back and slinks underneath my computer desk.  No amount of calling, bribing, or coaxing gets him out until I leave the room.  Since then, he gets stressed when you make a finger gun at him, or if you say the word bang.  He will often try to slink under the computer desk or go into his kennel.

So my theories on what might be going on:

* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him
* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud "BANG" is too harsh of a cue word
* The word "BANG" sounds too close to the word "Bad" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.

In any case, it's been months and I can't even bait him to lie on his back anymore.  Get him to lie down and try to move a treat across his shoulder?  He just goes "NOPE" and gets up and looks for his safety desk.

TL;DR: Tried to teach my dog to play dead, but he got stressed and now associates the cues with bad things.  He won't even lie on his back anymore.

---

**Comments:**

* "Ahaha, I can just imagine Ozzy slinking under the computer desk.  You might want to try using a different cue word or associating the 'BANG' with something positive, like treats."
* "I think you're onto something with the 'Bad' association.  Try using a different word and see if that helps.  And maybe try to desensitize him to the word 'BANG' by saying it in a soft voice and rewarding him for staying calm."
* "I've had similar issues with my dog and it's all about the context.  Try to make the training sessions more relaxed and fun, and see if that helps Ozzy associate the cues with good things again."
* "I think you should try to forget about the 'play dead' trick for now and focus on building trust with Ozzy.  Maybe try some fun, low-stress activities with him and see if that helps him relax and trust you again."
* "I've heard that dogs can be very literal, so maybe Ozzy is just associating the 'BANG' with the sound of a real gun or explosion.  You might want to try using a different cue word and see if that helps."
* "I think you should try to use positive reinforcement training methods instead of trying to force Ozzy to do something he's not comfortable with.  Maybe try clicker training and see if that helps him associate the cues with good things again."

TITLE: I [23F] contacting biological family for the first time

POST: Hey all, 

I wanted to get some advice on how to reach out to biological family members that I've never met. Basically, my mom got pregnant with me with her boyfriend of three years and he told her he doesn't like kids and didn't want to be involved with raising me, which I don't have any hard feelings about. My mom remarried and my step dad adopted me, so I had a father figure who treated me like his own. 

I've always been curious about my biological side of the family though and found them on Facebook. I have never reached out because I didn't think I was ready but recently have been thinking about contacting them. I know about a half sister I have from my bio dad's first marriage and she's in her thirties and lives really close by. My bio dad lives across the country. Would it be weird reaching out to her over Facebook? Or should I contact my biological dad first? I don't know if she knows about me so I don't want to shock her with the info or create a riff in the family. I'm really just a stranger to them.

TL;DR: I'm 23 and found my biological family on Facebook. I'm thinking of reaching out to my half sister who lives close by, but don't know if I should contact my biological dad first or if it's weird to reach out to her over Facebook.

COMMENTS:

* "I think it's great that you're considering reaching out to your biological family! It's understandable that you're hesitant, but it's also a great opportunity to connect with your roots. I would suggest starting with your half sister, since she's local and you can meet up in person. You could send her a message on Facebook and introduce yourself, explaining your situation and how you found her. Be respectful of her boundaries and give her space if she needs it. Good luck!"
* "I think it's a good idea to reach out to your biological dad first. He's your biological parent and has a right to know about you. You could send him a message on Facebook and introduce yourself, explaining your situation and how you found him. Be respectful of his boundaries and give him space if he needs it. It's also a good idea to be prepared for the possibility that he may not want to meet or talk to you, and that's okay too."
* "I think it's weird to reach out to your half sister over Facebook. You're essentially contacting a stranger and asking her to connect with you. It's better to start with your biological dad and work your way up. He's your biological parent and has a right to know about you. You could send him a message on Facebook and introduce yourself, explaining your situation and how you found him. Be respectful of his boundaries and give him space if he needs it."
* "I think it's a good idea to reach out to both your biological dad and half sister at the same time. You could send them both a message on Facebook and introduce yourself, explaining your situation and how you found them. Be respectful of their boundaries and give them space if they need it. It's also a good idea to be prepared for the possibility that they may not want to meet or talk to you, and that's okay too."

This post is a great example of how people can provide advice and support on a subreddit. The OP is seeking guidance on how to reach out to their biological family, and the commenters are offering their opinions and experiences to help the OP make a decision. The comments are respectful and considerate, and the OP is able to get a sense of the different perspectives and opinions on the matter. The post also highlights the importance of being respectful of people's boundaries and giving them space if they need it. Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships subreddit can be a valuable resource for people seeking advice and support.

TITLE: I [19/f] am going to college soon and my boyfriend [18, m] of a year doesn't seem to mind.

POST: So, my boyfriend [18/m] and I [19/f] have been together for over a year. We are very in love...but things are going to be changing soon. I am a senior in high school and he is a junior (we both started school late). I am applying for college and will more likely than not be out of state. He has said that he is ok with that and wants to stay together no matter what. We seem to talk more about him going to college than me...when I am the one leaving in 6 months. He seems less upset than me about my leaving. Sometimes I just think, what's the point of staying together? Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time. I sometimes get into phases where I get really insecure, especially in our relationship. This may be one of those phases...but it feels different. I need advice. Am I blowing all this way out of proportion?

TL;DR: I'm going to college soon and my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind. He's more focused on his own college plans than mine. I'm feeling insecure and unsure about our relationship. Should I be worried?

---

**Responses:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I think you're not blowing it out of proportion. It's normal to feel insecure when your partner seems more focused on their own plans than yours. It's like, you're the one leaving, but he's the one who's supposed to be supporting you through this change. It's not about being dramatic, it's about feeling heard and validated. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Tell him that you understand he's excited about his internship, but you need him to prioritize your feelings and plans too. It's okay to be upset, and it's okay to express those feelings to him. Good luck!"
2. **RelationshipGuru**: "OP, it sounds like you're feeling a bit abandoned and neglected. That's understandable, especially since you're the one leaving and he's staying behind. It's not about being dramatic, it's about feeling seen and heard. I would suggest having a conversation with him about how you're feeling, but also make sure you're not putting too much pressure on him. Remember that he's still young and figuring things out too. Maybe you can find ways to stay connected and support each other through this transition. It's not going to be easy, but it's worth it if you both want to make it work."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "OP, I'm not trying to be harsh, but it sounds like your boyfriend is kind of... clueless. I mean, he's not even considering how his plans might affect you? That's not a good sign. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this relationship is really worth the effort. You deserve someone who prioritizes your feelings and plans, not just their own. Don't get me wrong, it's great that he's excited about his internship, but it's not an excuse to ignore your needs. You deserve better."
4. **CollegeCounselor**: "OP, I'm a college counselor, and I've seen many students go through similar situations. It's normal to feel overwhelmed and insecure when you're leaving home for the first time. But it's great that you're thinking about your relationship and wanting to make it work. Here's a suggestion: why not plan a special date or activity before you leave, just the two of you? It could be a fun way to bond and create some special memories before you go. Also, consider setting up regular video calls or visits to stay connected. It might not be the same as being together in person, but it can help you feel more connected and supported. Good luck with your college journey, and I hope your relationship survives the distance!"


---

**Key Takeaways:**

1. It's normal to feel insecure and upset when your partner seems more focused on their own plans than yours.
2. Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling.
3. Prioritize your own needs and feelings in the relationship.
4. Consider setting up regular communication methods, such as video calls or visits, to stay connected while apart.
5. Re-evaluate the relationship if your partner is consistently ignoring your needs and feelings.

**Additional Tips:**

* Practice self-care and prioritize your own emotional well-being during this transition.
* Consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist if you're feeling overwhelmed.
* Be patient and understanding with your partner, but also communicate your needs and feelings clearly.
* Remember that it's okay to take time for yourself and focus on your own goals and aspirations.

TITLE: Me [17 F] with my boyfriend [17 M] He is being mean to me and it's my fault

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together little over a year. I love him very much and I think he's a wonderful person. Lately he's been very mean to me and it hurts but I do deserve it. Early in the relationship I sexted an old friend. My boyfriend agreed to stay with me and move past it. 

Since then I have cut off my relationship with that friend and he has access to all my social media. I have not messaged anyone like that at all or done anything suspicious. I feel very guilty over what I did and take 100% of the blame. 

These past few weeks he has been threatening to leave me, making me beg him to stay, calling me stupid, weak, a whore and ugly. I know I did a bad things so I am putting up with it because I know he gets angry about it. He does this when we fight, but otherwise he is the sweetest person I know. I really mean it, this is the only bad side to him. 

Recently I've been feeling really depressed and bad about myself. I'm scared to open up anymore because I don't want to be yelled at or lose him.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is being mean to me because of something I did in the past (sexted an old friend) and I feel guilty and take full blame. I'm scared to open up to him because I don't want to get yelled at or lose him.

TITLE: I really need some words of wisdom.

POST: Me 18 her 20. We were so happy together relationship ended and just a couple weeks ago we started talking again back to the way it was it was great. She randomly tells me today that we we stopped talking her ex was talking to her about getting engaged. I live this girl so much I tell her do what you will make you happiest. She tells me that I treat her better than he does and she told him that. 

Do I let her try and be happy with another man or do I fight to try and have her back. This woman is the first girl I feel on love with and first I made love with. She has told me for weeks she wants to be back with me. But the other guy wants to marry her.

I just want her to be Happy no matter what she does but I don't want to let her go.

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend (20) tells me she's considering getting engaged to her ex, who treats her worse than I do. She says I treat her better, but wants to make him happy. I'm torn between letting her go and fighting to be with her.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not ready to commit to you. She's considering getting engaged to someone else, and you're still holding onto hope. It's okay to accept that she's moved on and you deserve someone who wants to be with you fully."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Let her know that you understand she's considering getting engaged, but you want to know what's changed since you two broke up. Is it really just about the guy or is there something more?"
* "You can't force someone to choose you over someone else. If she's truly considering getting engaged, it's likely because she's found someone who is willing to commit to her in a way that you're not. You deserve someone who wants to be with you for the right reasons, not just because they're willing to propose."
* "I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're so attached to this girl. Is it because you truly love her, or is it because you're scared of being alone? Once you figure that out, you can make a decision that's best for you."
* "It's okay to let her go. You deserve someone who wants to be with you, not just someone who's willing to tolerate you. Remember that you're worth so much more than that."
* "Have you considered that she might be using you as a rebound or a distraction from her feelings for her ex? You deserve someone who is genuinely interested in you, not just someone who is using you to pass the time."
* "I think you should focus on yourself right now. Take some time to work on your own happiness and fulfillment. When you're feeling confident and happy, you'll be in a better place to make a decision about whether or not to pursue her again."

TITLE: Me (21m) dated a 19f for a month, i ruined things and pushed her out of my life, no i want to be friends again what should i do?

POST: Hey, 21 m here, dated a 19f for a month,

So a few months ago I met an amazing person, she was everything i could have asked for, we started dating, and i really rushed things ( sexually and labeling whatever we had). After around month she ended things with me. And 5 months later i'm justt starting to get over her. I want to apologize to her for so many things but i feel its wayy too late that i could be giving out the image that i want her back, i don't.

I want her in my life again as she's an amazing person and a great friend
But i feel its wayyy too late to apologize to her after 5 months of barely speaking to her.

Should i try to make amends?
Or should i accept the fact thats its over and just get her completely out of my life even though its all my fault?

TL;DR: Dated 19f for a month, ruined things, pushed her out of my life, now i want to be friends again, what should i do?

**Comments:**

* "You should focus on yourself and your own growth instead of trying to fix things with her. It's been 5 months, and you're still thinking about her. You need to work on yourself before trying to rekindle anything with her."
* "I think you should apologize sincerely and explain how you've grown and changed since then. If she's willing to listen, great. If not, then you need to accept that it's over and move on."
* "You're not going to get her back by apologizing. You need to accept that you messed up and move on. You can't keep holding onto something that's not meant to be."
* "I think you should try to make amends, but not because you want her back. Do it because you genuinely want to make things right and learn from your mistakes. If she's willing to forgive you, great. If not, then you need to accept that it's over."
* "You're still hung up on her after 5 months? That's not healthy. You need to focus on yourself and move on. Don't try to rekindle anything with her, it's not going to end well."
* "I think you should try to make amends, but only if you're willing to do the work to change and grow as a person. If you're just trying to get her back, then you're not going to be successful. You need to focus on becoming a better person and then see if she's willing to give you another chance."
* "You're not going to get her back by apologizing. You need to accept that you messed up and move on. You can't keep holding onto something that's not meant to be. You need to focus on yourself and find happiness with someone else."
* "I think you should try to make amends, but only if you're willing to listen to her and hear her out. If she's willing to talk to you and work through things, then great. If not, then you need to accept that it's over and move on."
* "You're still hung up on her after 5 months? That's not healthy. You need to focus on yourself and move on. Don't try to rekindle anything with her, it's not going to end well. You need to find someone else who is right for you and move on."



**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are divided on whether the OP should try to make amends with his ex or accept that it's over and move on. Some people think that he should apologize sincerely and explain how he's grown and changed since then, while others think that he's still hung up on her and needs to focus on himself and move on. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that he needs to do some self-reflection and work on himself before trying to rekindle anything with his ex.

TITLE: Relationship of conflicting faiths.

POST: So I've been in a relationship with this girl (Me m/18 her f/17) for about 2 months. Prior to that we dated for a little over 3 months nearly exactly a year ago. The first relationship ended abruptly when her father banned us from seeing each other because I'm an atheist and her father is a pastor and her faith mean an awful lot to her. 

This time her father has been a whole lot less protective of her by allowing us to be together. Unfortunately he still doesn't trust me at all. We aren't allowed to be together alone. My mother or some member of her family have to be with us at almost all times. If we go out in public her twin sister comes with us almost always. He has told me before that this has everything to do with my faith. In the beginning I totally understood his distrust but I thought it would get better over time. Prior to the relation ship we were friends for about 2 years and I had many conversations with her father on various topics.

This alone would be fine but she also pushes me very hard to change various mannerisms that I have. When she's around I can't really be myself at all. I find myself censoring myself very very often because she would get mad at me. Whenever I listen to my music around her she starts to get uncomfortable whenever the music has profanities or any themes really more than "G rated"(I listen to lots of punk rock if that gives you a better image).

I really like this girl but I find myself not being able to be myself around her at all. Anything that I would usually do/say around my friends is everything that she disapproves of. So what do I do? I honestly can't figure out what to do. Any help would be awesome! If you need any clarifications just ask.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's father doesn't trust me because I'm an atheist, and she pushes me to change my behavior and likes to censor my music. I feel like I'm losing myself in the relationship and don't know what to do.

**Comments:**

* "I think you need to have a serious talk with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's not fair that you're being forced to change who you are to make her happy. You deserve to be yourself and have a partner who accepts you for who you are."
* "I'm an atheist too and I can understand why her father might be wary of you. But it's not fair to expect you to change your beliefs just to make her father happy. You need to have a conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise."
* "I think you need to take a step back and reevaluate whether this relationship is really worth it for you. If you're constantly feeling like you're losing yourself and can't be yourself around her, then maybe it's time to move on."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her father and explain how his behavior is affecting you. Maybe he doesn't realize the impact his actions are having on your relationship and you can find a way to work together to make things better."
* "I think you should try to find common ground with her father. Maybe there are things you have in common that you can talk about and build a relationship on. It's not about converting him to your way of thinking, it's about finding a way to coexist and respect each other's differences."
* "I think you should try to find a compromise. Maybe you can find a way to compromise on the music and the way you act around her. It's not about changing who you are, it's about finding a way to make her happy and still be yourself."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with your girlfriend about how her father's behavior is affecting you. Maybe she doesn't realize the impact it's having on your relationship and you can find a way to work together to make things better."
* "I think you should try to find a way to make your girlfriend see that her father's behavior is not okay. Maybe she's not aware of how he's treating you and you can help her see that it's not fair. It's not about changing her father, it's about changing the way she sees him and the way he treats you."

TITLE: My friend [20M] and I [22M] got in a fight and now he wants to talk it over. But I kind of want to stop being friends but don't want to hurt his feelings.

POST: So a little over two weeks ago, my friend got upset with me because I preordered movie tickets, you can [Read more about that here] but basically, my step dad wanted me to preorder our tickets and then tell him where they are so him and his uncle can preorder the seats beside us, he ended up telling me I was rude and such and I got pretty upset about it as well. We have been having really stupid arguments for the last few months and I'm kind of sick of it, so I figure that even though he is my only friend (he doesn't know this, but he says I'm his only friend he can really hang out with), it's best to just end things.

Now yesterday he texted me saying "Hey shelcod" and I stupidly replied back with "Hey" because I was curious as to what he would say. He ended up asking to get together to talk face to face and I told him I am unavailable until next week.

Now the thing is I have thought about it more and realize that no matter how I tell it to him, it will end up hurting his feelings and I don't want to make anyone sad. So I've come up with 3 ideas. Would it be better if I just disappeared and said nothing more to him, should I tell it to his face, or should I go and make up with him and then just casually blow off all communication?

TL;DR: My friend and I got in a fight and now he wants to talk it over. I'm considering ending the friendship because of all the stupid arguments we've been having, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're just tired of the drama and stress that comes with being friends with this person. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries. If you don't feel like you can have a healthy, drama-free friendship with this person, it might be better to distance yourself or end the friendship altogether. Don't feel guilty about it, and don't worry about hurting his feelings - if he's a good friend, he'll understand and respect your decision."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think it's great that you're considering your friend's feelings, but you also need to think about your own emotional well-being. If you're consistently feeling drained or stressed out by the friendship, it might be time to re-evaluate it. Have you tried talking to your friend about how you're feeling and seeing if you can find a way to improve the dynamic? Sometimes, friends can work through issues and come out stronger on the other side. But if you've tried and it's still not working, it might be time to accept that it's time to move on."
3. **u/itsjustme123**: "I think you should just be honest with your friend. Tell him how you're feeling and why you think it's best to end the friendship. It's okay to be direct and clear, but also kind and respectful. You can say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about our friendship and I've come to realize that it's not working for me. I think we've been having too many arguments and it's causing me a lot of stress. I think it's best if we go our separate ways.' It's okay to prioritize your own feelings and needs, and it's better to be honest and direct than to lead your friend on or string them along."
4. **u/anonymous123456**: "I think you should just disappear and say nothing more to him. If you're not willing to put in the effort to maintain the friendship, then it's better to just cut ties and move on. You don't owe him an explanation or an apology. You can't control how he feels, but you can control how you react to the situation. Just be kind and respectful, but also firm and clear. Remember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationships, and if this friendship is holding you back, then it's time to let it go."

TITLE: I (22F) want have sex (again) with my married boss (38M).

POST: During summer he lives in my hometown and has office here and in his hometown, 100km away where he lives rest of the year. But comes in my hometown regularly.

I approached him. We were fuck buddies during summer before I went to college. No feelings. Usually sex is always better in my head, but this was different, it was damn good. He wasn't married then.

I went to college. He got married. He said that we can continue our'relationship' but during summer I travelled and worked abroad. Repeated that for 4 years. Minding my own business. We lost touch.

In June we met in our neighbourhood and he offered me a job. I was planning to go abroad again and he said that I can start when I want. This is my last year at uni, classes are easy and aren't mandatory. So I thought great, it is good job, good money and, most important, it will help me gain experience.

I work there 6 weeks. I want him to fuck me. Now I sit in office, with two other co-workers, he is in his office few meters away and I imagining how he fucks me. No comment.

He flirts a little when we are alone, nothing inappropriate, we have lunch sometimes... He said that if I want, I just have to send him text and that was it. Didn't mention it again.

I planned to work here until I finish uni and then I will move abroad for good. I have some dates, 'good' old Tinder, but nothing interesting.

Should I quit? Or just shut up and stay strong? 
Worst thing is that I can't trust myself. I am all good for 5 days, don't even thing about him and then in one second everything changes and I am sooo close to click'send'.

TL;DR: I have a job with my married boss who I used to have a fling with. I want to have sex with him again, but I'm torn between quitting or staying strong and not giving in to my desires.

Some users also pointed out that the OP's situation is complicated and that she should consider the potential consequences of her actions.

Here are a few examples of the community's responses:

* "I think you should quit the job. It's not worth the emotional turmoil and potential damage to your reputation. You deserve better than to be in a situation where you're constantly tempted to cheat on your boss."
* "I understand why you're torn. But I think you should stay strong and not give in to your desires. You're an adult and you have the power to make choices. Don't let your desires control you."
* "This is a really complicated situation. I think you should take some time to reflect on why you're feeling this way and what you want to get out of this situation. Are you looking for a way to cope with stress or are you genuinely interested in rekindling a romantic relationship with your boss?"
* "I think you should talk to your boss about how you're feeling. Maybe there's a way to address the underlying issues that are causing you to feel this way. It's not healthy to keep these feelings bottled up inside."

TITLE: [18/m] My girlfriend [19/F] is a abstinent, I am not.  This is causing some problems in our relationship, and I need some advice.

POST: We've been dating a little over 2 months, and she is the sweetest, 
most perfect girl I know.  The only way I can describe her is that she is the kind of person everyone wanted to grow up to be.  She's never had sex, she's never even tasted alcohol or touched a single drug.  

This has caused a problem with our relationship, because she wont have sex with me.  At the beginning of our relationship she told me to give it six months and it will happen, however she recently told me that she wants to remain a virgin until she is married.  I don't know what to do.  I really like her but this is a problem for me. I go from not being in a relationship and having sex fairly regularly, to doing without while im in one.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is abstinent, I'm not. She wants to remain a virgin until marriage, I'm not sure what to do.

**ADVICE FROM REDDITORS**

TITLE: I am [27/f] in a relationship with a partner [31/M] who hates himself because of a disability.

POST: I am a 27/f grad student who works part time. My boyfriend, who I am technically broken up with now, is 31 and is currently unemployed but taking classes part-time. He wants to have a full time job by the end of this year. 

We both have our issues and that is putting extra stress on the relationship, but my boyfriend's constant negativity and lack of motivation has become a massive problem. My boyfriend was born with greater than 50% hearing loss in both ears and cannot hear many things without the assistance of hearing aids. He wasn't able to hear well at all until his teenage years and he received better hearing aids that helped him hear many things he could not hear before. While he has graduated from college and held jobs, he still views himself as a victim, even though he can hear well at this point in his life.

He is seriously the most self loathing person I've ever met. I have tried to encourage him but I'm losing patience. In the beginning I didn't care that my boyfriend was hearing impaired since there wasn't a communication problem at all, he can hear well with hearing aids, and he seemed to be a pretty confident and social person despite his hearing impairment. Now, I am starting to think that he was faking it for the first few months, and he's really just content to be an angry and negative human being. He gets mad every time he thinks someone is looking at his hearing aids, or asks well-meaning questions about his hearing loss. We both know it's going to happen once in a while, but every time it does he just gets mad and shuts down. 

He can be a wonderful boyfriend when he wants to be, and I still believe he is a good person with a big heart. We've decided to just be friends for the immediate future, and try again when we're both ready, but I don't know if I should just forget him completely, or support him from a distance. He has a lot of positive qualities, he is very intelligent, and he is compassionate and thoughtful. I still believe he can turn his life around, but I don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too much.

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a guy who hates himself because of his hearing impairment. He's self-loathing, negative, and gets mad when people ask questions about his hearing loss. I'm trying to figure out if I should just forget him or support him from a distance.

This post is a great example of how people with disabilities can be affected by internalized ableism, which is the process of internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about one's own disability. The boyfriend's self-loathing and negativity are likely a result of societal stigma and ableism, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and low self-esteem.

The OP is struggling with how to support her boyfriend and whether she should continue to be involved in his life. She is torn between her feelings for him and her frustration with his negativity and self-loathing. This is a common dilemma for many people who are in relationships with individuals with disabilities, as they may feel a sense of responsibility to support and care for their partner, but also may feel overwhelmed by the challenges that come with being in a relationship with someone who is struggling with internalized ableism.

The post also highlights the importance of self-care and setting boundaries in relationships. The OP is recognizing that she needs to prioritize her own well-being and take care of herself, which is essential for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship.

The comments on this post are also worth reading, as they offer a range of perspectives and advice from people who have experienced similar situations. Some commenters suggest that the OP should focus on supporting her boyfriend's efforts to overcome his self-loathing and negativity, while others advise her to prioritize her own needs and take a step back from the relationship. Overall, this post is a great example of how people with disabilities can be affected by internalized ableism, and how relationships can be affected by these issues.

TITLE: I want to cut things off because they will end by the end of the summer, but I have no one else in town.

POST: My guy (20) and myself (20) are incompatible. We argue over small stupid things, have different personalities (introverted vs. extroverted), and I think are on two different planes of maturity.

We have been together for about 1.5 years. Met in college, he ended up dropping out by the end of the semester due to grades and family issues. We stayed together LD until the end of the spring semester. I 
ended things between us by the middle of June; I couldn't handle it.

We ended up together again this past December, still a LD situation. We made some great progress in communication and thinking of the other person in our choices and stuff. It was a very different relationship this time around, much better.

Then he told me in late March he would be not be attending the university I am currently enrolled in (like I was anxiously anticipating), but another in our hometown because it was a better situation for him. 

Fast forward to now. He was officially accepted two days ago. He says he doesn't know how to act or what to say around me anymore because things have just begun to crumble. 

Why would I want to stay with someone I know I won't be with in the fall? Why not let us both be free from the frustration?
We love each other still. I'm glad he's going to this other university; it will be a more successful environment for him. But it hurts. I have no friends where I live. My good friends all live a couple hours away, and I don't have the time or money to devote to going out to see them, as much as I'd like to.

Would it be worth it to try to stay with him? Or cut things off now?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with someone who will be moving away in the fall. We're incompatible, and I have no one else in town. Should I stay with him or cut things off now?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're already done with the relationship. You're just trying to convince yourself to stay. Cut things off now and focus on yourself. You deserve better than a relationship that's just going to end anyway."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. Let him know that you know he's leaving and that you're struggling with the idea of being apart. You might be surprised by his feelings and what he's willing to work through."
* "I'm in a similar situation, and I ended up staying with my partner because we both knew it was temporary. It was hard, but it was worth it to me. You should do what feels right for you, but don't rule out the possibility of making it work."
* "You're not alone! I'm in the same boat. I'm trying to stay with my partner, but it's getting harder and harder. I think you should try to stay in touch and see how things go. You never know, you might find a way to make it work."
* "I think you should cut things off now. You deserve better than a relationship that's just going to end anyway. You're not going to be happy stuck in a relationship that's just going to fall apart. Take this opportunity to focus on yourself and find what you want in life."
* "I'm in a similar situation, and I ended up staying with my partner because we both knew it was temporary. It was hard, but it was worth it to me. You should do what feels right for you, but don't rule out the possibility of making it work."

Some people share their own experiences of being in similar situations and offer words of encouragement. Ultimately, the decision is up to the OP, but it's clear that they are struggling with the idea of being apart from their partner and are unsure of what to do.

TITLE: TIFU by forgetting which CD I was listening to when my head unit died

POST: This wasn't today, this was in the summer of '95.

I was making decent money living at home and lifeguarding during the summer.  Had a car that I had saved up to install a sound system.  I got Infinity speakers, Alpine V12 amp, and a [Sony CDX-C910] head unit.  This head unit was the most expensive, therefore best (teenager, remember) thing I could buy.  It had to be professionally installed by an authorized Sony installer to not void the warranty (or some such bs).

Anyway, it is an amazing CD player, hooked up to a nice amp, powering decent speakers in a bad environment for music; I loved every bit of it.

Now for those who can't imagine it now, we used to have to go to the store to buy CDs.  I lived in a smaller town, but we had a store within about ~10 miles that i bought some of my rarer imports from.  Stuff you wouldn't find in the mall.

One day my head unit died, no display, no power.  I didn't think to try and manually remove whatever CD was in there.  I scheduled an appointment with the installer of the head unit and a few days later, took it in.  I didn't have a ride, but it was my day off, so I grabbed some CDs out of the car and went into their sound room and chilled out for a few hours reading magazines.  Yes, I said hours(!).  About 3 hours later the installer comes out and finds me.  He explained that they thought it was something simple like a blown fuse.  They found a blown fuse and replaced it, but the sound was horrible.  They troubleshot the whole unit before replacing it.  Twice.  They couldn't figure out what was going on until they swapped out the CD.  That's when he held up the CD I was listening to at the time it died, [Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God (halo nine UK import)] disc 2, and I it all hit me.

For those that have never heard it - here's the first song on that CD ([Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God](

TL;DR: I forgot which CD was in my car's CD player when it died, and it took a few hours and a trip to the installer to figure it out.

EDITS: None

COMMENTS:

* "I can imagine the installer's face when he realized you were listening to NIN's Closer to God for 3 hours straight"
* "I'm pretty sure I would've forgotten what CD was in my car too, especially if it was a rare import"
* "I love how you casually mention 'I lived in a smaller town' like it's no big deal.  That's like me saying 'I used to live in a cardboard box'"
* "I'm surprised you didn't get in trouble for 'chilling out' in the sound room for 3 hours"
* "This is the most relatable post I've ever seen.  I once forgot which CD was in my car and had to go back to the store to buy it again"
* "I'm pretty sure the installer was just trying to get you to leave so he could get back to work"

This post is a great example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of a mistake they made. In this case, the author forgot which CD was in their car's CD player when it died, and it took a few hours and a trip to the installer to figure it out. The post is filled with nostalgic references to the 90s, and the comments are filled with people sharing their own similar experiences and making light of the situation. The post has been upvoted over 10,000 times and has become a beloved meme in the r/tifu community.

TITLE: [NSV][PIC] Frustration, determination and the perfect pair of pants.

POST: So, I started running.  

More specifically, I started the C25k program in hopes of becoming a *runner*.  Sometimes, it still feels like I might not make it through those last intervals of week 3.   However, after week 1, I learned how tolerable running could be if I just never looked at the timer.   *("I still have THAT much time left?  Fff.")*  Instead, I would zone out, not look at the clock and think about awesome, motivating things.

Since starting on this road, every Monday I would muster up the courage to step up to the scale and be faced with my destiny, my frustration, watching the numbers move in tiny increments or sometimes, not at all.  The numbers shouldn't have mattered so much to me, but they did.  I would get discouraged and lose focus on the fitness goals I was truly trying to achieve.   

I stopped looking at the scale, too. 

If I'd had to guess at what the scale would've said then, it wouldn't have been much different from 2 months ago...  and then my capris humbled me.  

So, I bought these awesome capris a while ago that had sadly been stretching out in the wash over time.  I loved these capris.  (When you find bottoms you like, you never let them go.)   Hoping to find another pair, I go back to the store and there they are...  one last pair tucked away in a sale rack, but the tag reads 2 sizes too small.   Perfect for "goal" clothing! 

In the modesty of my bedroom, I try on these capris to see how far I have to go to get into these babies.  I don't know which emotion was stronger, dismay or delight, when they fit slightly loosely around my giddy little self.    My happy dance quickly turned into: *"Ergh... now I have to find something else that fits me this well..."*  Which subsequently turned back into a happy dance after I realized how much easier it's going to be to find clothes that FIT now...

TL;DR: I started running, got frustrated with the scale, stopped looking at it, and then found the perfect pair of pants that fit me well, which motivated me to keep pushing forward!

[Image: A photo of the author wearing the capris, with a big smile on their face and a thumbs up]

**NSV** (New Selfie Victory) **[PIC]** Frustration, determination and the perfect pair of pants.

**Edit:** I just wanted to add that I'm not saying I'm done with the scale, but I'm saying I'm not letting it dictate my progress.  I'm focusing on how I feel, how my clothes fit, and how I'm performing in my workouts.  The scale is just a number, and I'm trying to focus on the bigger picture.  Thanks for the support, everyone!

TITLE: I [23M] have had a crush on [21F] for 2 months without having met or seen her at all. Can it count?

POST: As title says, I've only been in contact through text (I don't know how she looks). I've known her for around 2 years, but a lot of time has passed within those 2 years without us talking. We recently began communicating more often, and related to that, I fell in love. I've been in love before, but only with girls who I've seen and talked to the "normal way". I mean love as in "I'm prepared to spend my meager student savings to fly across half of the world just to meet her for a day and hold her hand for a second" love.

If you asked me what I love/dislike about her, I would be able to list things that I don't love, but they seem irrelevant to me at this moment, and most importantly I dont want to turn this into a study of her, since I would unavoidably skew it to get the answer I want.

She knows how I feel but highly doubts that I love the "real" her in any relevant way. I have my reasons to believe that personal reasons she previously revealed to me before I confessed shapes her opinion in the matter (which is why I'm here for a second opinion). Reasons that are private and really not relevant as long as you accept the premise. Her feelings are ultimately equally irrelevant for this specific question.

My question is: Am I LIKELY loving someone that only exists in my head? In a way I guess we all love/hate people based on personal perceptions, but you get what I mean. I know she isn't a reflection of me, it's her differences that excite me the most (I think). 

I know 2 months is a drop in the ocean, and I could just wait and see if my feelings disappear as quickly as they came (previous experiences hint towards years of feeling like this before it fades).

TL;DR: I've been in love with someone I've never met or seen, and I'm wondering if it counts. I know it sounds weird, but I'm genuinely curious.

**Top comments:**

* "I think it's possible to love someone without having met them, but it's definitely not the same as loving someone you've met and gotten to know. You're basing your feelings on your imagination and the idea of who she is, rather than the real person. That being said, it's not necessarily a bad thing. You can still develop a strong connection with someone even if you haven't met them. Just be aware that there's a difference between loving the idea of someone and loving the real person."
* "I think you're romanticizing the idea of loving someone without having met them. It's not a unique or special experience, it's just a fantasy. You're not really loving her as a person, you're loving the idea of her. And that's okay, but don't pretend like it's something more than it is. You're not going to get to know her as a person until you actually meet her and spend time with her."

Don't worry too much about whether or not it's'real' love, just focus on building a connection with her."
* "I think it's a bit of both. You're loving the idea of her, but you're also loving the person she is. It's not just a fantasy, it's a real feeling.

TITLE: Me [18 M] trying to choose between two girls, and I need advice. [16F and 18F]

POST: I'm a senior in high school, so I'm going to preface this post by saying I'm not looking for something long-term, but I want to have a fun relationship to end the year. 

Girl 1 is 16, so she's a little young, but she's very attractive, and we share lots of interests/ have similar hobbies. I've had a bit of a crush on her for a while, but never really did anything. (dating an 8th grader as a sophomore seemed a bit weird)The thing is,though, I am friends with her older sister, so I don't know if this will end up being a problem.

Girl 2 is 18, and I was told from her best friend that she wants to hook-up with me. She's a very funny girl and also very cute but I've heard from multiple people that she's still not over her ex. She's also much more experienced sexually, which is a positive.

TL;DR: I'm torn between a 16-year-old girl who's cute and shares my interests, but might be a bit too young, and an 18-year-old girl who's more experienced, but might still be hung up on her ex.

I'm really torn between these two options, and I want to make the right choice. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

---

This post is problematic for several reasons:

1. The OP is considering dating a 16-year-old girl, which is illegal in many places. Even if it's not illegal, it's still a significant age gap and raises concerns about the power dynamic and potential exploitation.
2. The OP is also considering dating an 18-year-old girl who is still recovering from a breakup. This could lead to emotional manipulation and exploitation, especially if the OP is not emotionally mature enough to handle a potentially complicated situation.
3. The OP is prioritizing physical attractiveness and shared interests over the well-being and boundaries of the girls involved. This is a concerning lack of empathy and maturity.
4. The OP is seeking advice from a community, which may not be equipped to provide informed and responsible guidance. The post is likely to attract a range of opinions, some of which may be harmful or irresponsible.

Overall, this post is a good example of why it's important to prioritize the well-being and boundaries of others, especially in situations involving power imbalances and potential exploitation. It's also important to recognize the importance of emotional maturity and empathy in relationships. The post should be removed or edited to prioritize the well-being and boundaries of the girls involved.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my group of best friends since childhood [26 M]. Our interactions have grown boring, stagnant, and apathetic. I want change, but I don't want to leave them behind.

POST: Recently, I was taking stock of what I did this summer, and the answer was...not a whole lot.

I have a group of about eight guys I grew up with and consider lifelong friends. People that have met us have said what we have is really rare, some Stand By Me shit. I love them. I was the best man in one of their weddings.

Some have moved and got married, and one in particular is going through some difficult financial times. In those cases, I can understand why I don't see and do things with them as much. It's a natural part of getting older.

Still, though, there's a group of 4-5 guys I see every single weekend. But the problem is we can never decide on doing anything. One person doesn't like clubs. Another doesn't want to spend cash in a bar. Another hates beaches. There's always fighting about what to do. There's always dissent. And it always ends in the lowest common denominator---sitting in one of our apartments drinking and watching TV.

And I've reached a breaking point. I'm single, and I really don't have any social circle outside of them. I went to college on the other side of the country, and while I have friends there that I keep in touch with, I see them once a year.

I honestly don't know what to do? I don't even know how to make friends at this point. And I don't want to abandon my friends that I love. Up until a few years ago, things were fun! But for a 26 year-old, single guy living in the city, my life has become so boring and routine that I want to scream.

Help!

TL;DR: I'm 26, single, and stuck in a rut with my group of childhood friends. We never do anything exciting, always argue about what to do, and I'm starting to feel like I'm missing out on life. I don't want to abandon them, but I need some excitement and change in my life. What can I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "I think you're looking at this the wrong way. Instead of trying to 'change' your friends, why not try to change your own approach to socializing? Instead of waiting for someone else to suggest something, take the initiative and plan something yourself. You can invite your friends to join you, but don't be discouraged if they don't want to. You might be surprised at how many new experiences and connections you can make by taking the lead."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "I think you're being a bit dramatic. You're 26, single, and living in the city. You have the world at your feet! Instead of complaining about your friends, why not try to find new people to hang out with? Join a club, take a class, volunteer... there are so many ways to meet new people and have new experiences. And if your friends don't want to join you, that's okay. You don't need their permission to have fun."
3. **FriendOfAFriend**: "I think you're feeling stuck because you're trying to hold onto something that's no longer serving you. It's okay to acknowledge that your friendships have changed and that you need to move on. You don't have to abandon your friends, but you can start to distance yourself and focus on building new relationships. Remember, it's okay to outgrow people and things. It's a natural part of life."
4. **Optimist123**: "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It sounds like you're feeling a bit burnt out and need a break. Why not take some time for yourself and focus on your own interests and hobbies? You might find that you have more energy and enthusiasm for life when you're doing things that bring you joy. And who knows, you might even meet some new people who share your passions!"

**Original poster's response:**

"Wow, thank you all for your thoughtful comments! I think I was being a bit dramatic, and I appreciate the perspective. I'm going to take your advice and start taking the initiative to plan things myself. And who knows, maybe I'll meet some new people along the way. Thanks again for your help!"

TITLE: Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [23 M/F] of 3 years doing long distance - i'm loosing faith and getting suspicions.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 and a half years and recently, I've had to move away because of my job. Its only a 2 hour distance but from going from seeing each other everyday to once in a week or in this case, one in 3 weeks... its hard. He has many more girl friends than boy friends and i am completely ok with that. but recently he's been seeing more of this one friend. today he says that its a good thing because her best friend has got a bf now and therefore, she feels alone and he feels alone too so it work out for both of them to spend time together. 

I completely trust my boyfriend and he's never given me any reason to doubt him but i still can't help but feel uncomfortable. I don't know how to address this because I feel its totally unfair of me to say that he cant see her that often or that I am uncomfortable with it coz she is a good friend of his. On top of that, our communication sucks. his phone is crap so he doesnt recieve my texts half the time and he's shit at calling anyone. I don't know how to deal with this and would really appreciate some advice.

TL;DR: 3 year relationship, 2 hour distance, boyfriend has many female friends, recently seeing one friend more often, feels uncomfortable, unsure how to address it, poor communication.

COMMENTS:

* "I think you're being unfair to your boyfriend. He's not doing anything wrong. He's just being a good friend to her. You need to focus on your own feelings and not assume the worst. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling, but don't accuse him of anything."
* "I agree with the above comment. It sounds like you're feeling insecure and that's normal. But instead of jumping to conclusions, try to talk to your boyfriend about your feelings and see if there's anything you can do to improve your communication. Maybe he's not aware of how you're feeling and a conversation can clear the air."
* "I think you should be worried about the fact that he's not responding to your texts half the time. That's a red flag. You deserve better than someone who can't even be bothered to respond to your messages. Maybe this is a sign that he's not as invested in the relationship as you are."
* "I think you're being too sensitive. He's just being a good friend to her. You need to relax and not overthink things. Maybe you're just feeling lonely and that's why you're feeling this way."
* "I think you should try to talk to your boyfriend about how you're feeling, but also try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. You've been together for 3 years, that's a big deal. Don't let one little thing come between you two. Maybe you can even plan a trip to see each other more often to make up for the distance."
* "I think you should be worried about the fact that he's not making an effort to communicate with you. That's a sign of disinterest. You deserve someone who will make an effort to talk to you and keep you updated on what's going on in their life."

This post is a great example of how people on the internet can provide a wide range of opinions and advice, some of which may be helpful and others that may not be as constructive. The OP is clearly feeling uncertain and insecure about the situation, and some of the comments are trying to reassure her that she's being unfair or overreacting. Others are more critical and suggest that she should be worried about the communication issues or the fact that her boyfriend is spending more time with his female friend. Overall, it's a good reminder to approach online discussions with a critical eye and to consider multiple perspectives before making a decision.

TITLE: Many of my [25M] friends [~25Fs] want to cheat with me. What is going on?

POST: First, a little background information about me:

I was never that popular in primary and high school, not a loser mind you, but never super popular.

My parents are pretty religious (I'm not at all) and strict, and I went to all-boys schools. Because of this, the friends that I had were mostly guy friends, and most girls I knew I thought of as acquaintances.

After moving to the big city to attend university I made a decision to not be the weird loner in class, and began the 'fake it til you make it' thing - and I really did make it. I got myself a bunch of really nice close friends and we do lots of stuff together all the time. First time really having female friends.

Now here comes my problem:

Most of my girl friends are in, what I would call, pretty serious comitted relationships, and weirdly enough they want to cheat on their boyfriends with me!

And I'm not misunderstanding any weird signals, they are very direct:

* "My boyfriend isn't home for the weekend, do you want to come home with me tonight and have some dirty fun?"
* "I only asked you to come outside with me to make out with you, if you'd like."
* Etc.

I always turn them down - I never liked the idea of cheating and they know this. One of them even told me the next day that she respected me more now.

I find it really weird that it isn't just one fluke, but many of my friends that try this. And mind you, not the female friends that are single, only the ones in relationships.

What I'm wondering is, why do they do this? Is it some kind of weird test of my ethics?

This isn't normal is it? Am I sending some 'cheaty'-vibes?
Do I just treat it as a compliment?

TL;DR: Many of my female friends in relationships want to cheat with me, and I'm confused about why. Is it a test of my ethics or something else?

---

This post has sparked a lot of discussion and debate on the subreddit, with many users offering their thoughts and opinions on the situation. Some common themes that have emerged include:

* The idea that the women in question may be seeking a thrill or a sense of excitement in their relationships, and that they may see the OP as a way to get that without having to confront the issues in their own relationships.
* The possibility that the women may be testing the OP's ethics and boundaries, and that they may be surprised or impressed by his refusal to cheat.
* The idea that the OP may be unintentionally sending out signals that he is available or interested in cheating, and that he may need to be more mindful of his behavior and body language.
* The suggestion that the OP should not take the advances of his friends personally, and that he should focus on maintaining healthy and respectful relationships with them.

Overall, the discussion has been lively and thought-provoking, with many users offering their own experiences and insights into the situation. The OP has also received a lot of support and encouragement for his decision to refuse to cheat, and for being honest and open about his feelings and boundaries.

TITLE: My GF [18F] and I [17M] plan on breaking up before college. Don't know what to feel anymore.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year and will soon be starting our last semester of school together. Sometime earlier this year, we agreed the best plan of action going into college would be for us to break up, not because we were unsatisfied with the relationship but because we both accepted we needed to develop individually, we could end up geographically really far apart and other things like that. Odds tend to stack against relationships from high school going into college. 

I don't know how I feel about this anymore. It doesn't feel good though. 

I love her. I fall in love with her again and again every day and the closer we get to this agreement, the more I love her. It seems stupid to love her with the expiration date attached to the relationship, but it feels real and I can't stop. 

We've tried to talk about this quite a few times but the conversation doesn't tend to go much of anywhere because I don't know how I feel anymore. It hurts to talk about it, too. I know what its like to have to leave people close to me and it hurts knowing that know they're just images on my computer or words on my phone or photos on my desk. I don't know if I'm ready to make her a memory.

When we first talked about this we were both so certain that, despite the fact we loved each other, a breakup before college would be best. But now I'm wondering if want I really want is to try to make it work past graduation. I need help sorting out my own feelings about the relationship and thoughts about the reality of the situation.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I plan to break up before college, but the closer we get, the more I love her and I'm having trouble accepting the expiration date on our relationship. I'm unsure if I'm ready to let her go.

---

This post is a classic example of a common dilemma in relationships: the uncertainty and emotional turmoil that comes with knowing that a breakup is inevitable, but struggling to come to terms with it. The OP (original poster) is torn between his love for his girlfriend and the reality of their situation. He's aware that the odds are against them, but he can't help but feel a strong emotional attachment to her.

The post is well-written and provides a clear and relatable scenario. The OP's emotions are authentic and easy to understand, making it a great example of a post that could spark a thoughtful and empathetic discussion in the r/relationships community.

Some possible responses to this post could include:

* Encouragement to explore the OP's feelings and consider what he truly wants from the relationship.
* Validation of the OP's emotions and a reminder that it's normal to feel conflicted in situations like this.
* Practical advice on how to approach the conversation with his girlfriend and navigate the breakup.
* Personal anecdotes or shared experiences that can help the OP feel less alone in his emotions.

Overall, this post is a great example of a relatable and thought-provoking relationship dilemma that could spark a meaningful discussion in the r/relationships community.

TITLE: TIFU by looking like an asshole at the GreatClips

POST: Today I got a haircut. 

I was going to give the Asian lady who cut my hair a tip so I asked her to charge $4 extra on my card like I normally do at this place. Little did I know, they had changed their system to what most consider a normal tipping method where you write your tip on the receipt. 

After filling out the receipt and handing it back to her, I asked (referring to the new style of tipping), "How is that for you?" At first she didn't seem to understand so I repeated it louder, "How is that for you?" She looked at the receipt, quickly nodded and said equally loud that the tip was much "good, good!"

I was given weird stares on the way out by the other eight or so people there. I didn't realize my mistake until I closed the door. The worst part is that she gave a really good haircut and probably deserved more of a tip but I am poor.

TL;DR: I accidentally made it seem like I was trying to bribe the hairdresser at GreatClips by asking her if the tip was "good, good" after giving her a receipt with a tip written on it.

---

This post is a great example of a TIFU (Today I F**ked Up) story, where the author shares a humorous and relatable tale of how they messed up in a situation. In this case, the author accidentally made it seem like they were trying to bribe the hairdresser at GreatClips by asking her if the tip was "good, good" after giving her a receipt with a tip written on it.

The post is relatable because it's easy to imagine someone in a similar situation, and the author's embarrassment and self-awareness make the story even more entertaining. The use of humor and lighthearted language, such as "I am poor," adds to the post's comedic value.

The subreddit r/tifu is a great place for people to share their own TIFU stories and connect with others who have had similar experiences. The community is known for its humor and empathy, and the posts are often entertaining and relatable. If you're looking for a good laugh and a chance to connect with others, r/tifu is a great subreddit to check out.

TITLE: x-post from AskReddit: Girlfriend of three years made out with two people over the weekend... What to do?

POST: I was told to post this here for more advice. 

[Original thread](

The title says most of it... We were partying with some friends, and about halfway through the night, one of my buddies asked me if she and I were still together. We'd been having some rough times over the last few months, so I figured they were just asking how that had turned out. I said yes, and so did she. Over the course of the evening, a few more people came and asked me the same thing.

At the end of the night, one of my good friends came to me a little sheepishly, and told me my girlfriend had gone up to him and just made out with him with no warning. A couple others told me she was "all over them," and I walked in on her making out with another kid that I didn't know so well.

When I confronted her the next day, I asked what was going on. She said she "didn't know what came over her" and that she was sorry. But I don't buy it. You don't just do that stuff if there isn't something under the surface, right?

I could really use some advice on what to do, how to deal with what's gone on, and where to go from here. She always told me that she'd dump me on the spot if she found out I was fooling around with other people, and that she thought it was completely unacceptable and there was no excuse; so I never thought I'd be dealing with this with her. I'm pretty pissed off, and a little hurt; hypocrisy has always driven me up the wall, so I'm really not sure what to do.

Thanks in advance, Reddit!

TL;DR: Girlfriend of three years made out with two people over the weekend, and I'm trying to figure out what to do. She says she didn't know what came over her, but I don't buy it. Help!

**Comments:**

* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered taking some time to think about whether this relationship is really worth saving? You deserve better than someone who's willing to cheat on you, even if they don't think they're doing anything wrong.
* I think you should have a calm, rational conversation with her about what happened. Ask her why she did it, and what she thinks about the fact that she's been saying one thing to you (that she wouldn't cheat) and then doing the opposite. See if you can get some real answers out of her.
* OP, I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that you deserve someone who respects you and your relationship. If she's willing to cheat on you, she's not the right person for you. Sorry to say it, but it might be time to move on.
* I think you should take some time to think about what you want from this relationship. Do you want to work through this and try to move forward, or do you want to end it and start fresh? Either way, you need to prioritize your own feelings and well-being.
* OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a really tough situation. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about what's going on? They might be able to help you work through your feelings and figure out what you want to do next.
* I think you should have a conversation with her about boundaries. If she's willing to cheat on you, she's not respecting your boundaries or your relationship. You need to figure out what you're comfortable with and communicate that to her.
* OP, I'm not sure what to say, but I do know that you deserve someone who respects you and your relationship. If she's willing to cheat on you, she's not the right person for you. Sorry to say it, but it might be time to move on.

TITLE: 21 year old female, job interview at GameStop, any other workers who could answer questions?

POST: I have a job interview at GameStop, I was just wondering if anyone could tell me how much I should dress up for this interview? I don't want to under/over-dress. Also, is this something that I should bring a resume to? I have turned in my application and have gotten the interview, but I also want to get the job. I have previous experience including 3 years as an assistant manager at another retail store. I have since moved out of state for school and left on good terms. I would REALLY like to have this job. Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: 21 year old female, job interview at GameStop, seeking advice on dress code and what to bring to the interview.

RESPONSES:

* "Dress professionally, but not too formally. Think business casual. You can't go wrong with a pair of slacks and a nice blouse. And yes, bring a resume! It's always better to be prepared. Good luck with your interview!"
* "I used to work at GameStop and I can tell you that the dress code is pretty relaxed. You'll be fine with a pair of jeans and a nice top. But still, dress to impress! And don't forget to bring your resume. It's a good idea to have it ready just in case they ask for it."
* "I've had a few interviews at GameStop and I can tell you that they're pretty laid back. But still, dress professionally. You want to show them that you're taking the interview seriously. And yes, bring a resume. It's always a good idea to have one ready."
* "I'm a current GameStop employee and I can tell you that the dress code is pretty relaxed. You can wear jeans and a nice top, but still dress to impress. And yes, bring your resume. It's a good idea to have it ready just in case they ask for it."
* "I've had a few interviews at GameStop and I can tell you that they're pretty picky about the way you dress. So, dress professionally. You want to show them that you're taking the interview seriously. And yes, bring a resume. It's always a good idea to have one ready."

Overall, the responses from the Reddit community are generally in agreement that dressing professionally but not too formally is the way to go, and that bringing a resume is a good idea. The community also provides some specific advice on what to wear, such as a pair of slacks and a nice blouse, and suggests dressing to impress. The responses also provide some reassurance that the dress code at GameStop is relatively relaxed, but still encourages the OP to dress professionally. The community's advice is helpful and informative, and provides the OP with a good sense of what to expect and how to prepare for the interview.

TITLE: Guys buying my girlfriend drinks at the bar

POST: My girlfriend likes to go out quite a bit, mostly going to bars to hang out with friends or meet people there. Many of the times, I am not with her but she always comes home to me and is faithful. She told me today that she was invited out for some drinks with a guy friend of hers, but she didn't have any money to buy drinks. He said that he would buy her a few to help her out.

Here is where I chimed in. I asked, "Don't you think its a bit weird for guys to buy you drinks when you have a boyfriend.?" She doesn't seem to think so and lets guys buy her drinks at the bar all the time. She doesn't mind if strangers buy her drinks at the bar either.

I just think its a bit weird that she lets other guys buy her drinks at the bar when she clearly has a boyfriend. Is it weird for me to think this way?

TL;DR: Girlfriend lets guys buy her drinks at the bar, even when she has a boyfriend. I think it's weird, but she doesn't seem to mind.

---

This post has sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many users sharing their thoughts and opinions on the matter. Some users are more understanding of the girlfriend's actions, while others are more critical. Here are some of the top comments:

* "I think it's weird too, but it's not uncommon for people to buy drinks for friends or acquaintances. If she's not doing anything wrong and is still faithful to you, maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with her instead of worrying about what other guys are doing." (u/throwaway1234567)
* "I don't think it's weird at all. If a guy wants to buy her a drink, that's his choice. It doesn't mean she's interested in him romantically or that she's cheating on you. Maybe you should focus on building a stronger connection with her and not worrying about what other guys are doing." (u/username123)
* "I think it's weird because it's a power dynamic. Guys are buying her drinks, which can be seen as a way to exert control or influence over her. It's not necessarily a romantic or sexual thing, but it's still a way for guys to try to manipulate her. Maybe you should talk to her about how you feel and see if she's aware of the dynamic." (u/username456)
* "I think it's weird because it's a sign of a lack of communication and trust in your relationship. If you're not comfortable with your girlfriend letting other guys buy her drinks, you should talk to her about it and see if you can come to a compromise. Maybe you can set boundaries or have open conversations about what you're comfortable with." (u/username789)

Overall, the discussion on this post has been lively and thought-provoking, with many users sharing their own experiences and opinions on the matter. While some users are more understanding of the girlfriend's actions, others are more critical and think that it's a sign of a lack of communication and trust in the relationship. Ultimately, the post has sparked a conversation about the importance of communication and trust in relationships.

TITLE: My boyfriend (M17) constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and really messes up my (F17) self esteem.

POST: We've been dating for fourteen months. My boyfriend has always been very honest with me about everything, which is one of the things I first loved about him. If I asked him a question, he'd give an honest answer, no matter what. My problem with this started about six months ago, when he told me that he liked another girl for the first month of our relationship, and the only reason they aren't dating is because she turned him down twice. It broke my heart. But he's started being honest about things that I really don't want to know the answer to, or question I haven't asked, such as telling me how hot another girl is, or how she has an awesome chest or ass, or along the same lines. Like, I get it. They're all very attractive. He'll always send me links from porn that he finds really attractive.

But the problem lies in the fact that I have absolutely terrible self image, and with good reason. I have little to no curves, and a bit of extra chub on my stomach. I'm not fat by any means, but definitely not skinny. And every single girl he likes, or thinks is attractive, has a massive chest with a huge butt and is perfectly skinny. Think Victoria Secret model. And if they aren't curvy, they're short and cute and skinny and blonde, which is the exact opposite from me.

The real kicker came yesterday, when he decided it would be a good idea to tell me he's in love with a fictional character. I freaked out, probably a bit more than I should, but I'm just so tired of it. Once we started fighting over this, he started trying to eat his words, saying that he just meant that she's "fun to play with". He had been talking about how she's so cute and perfect and attractive with awesome cleavage for ten minutes before, which is just suppose to traslate into "fun to play with". I don't know what to do. I love him so much, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm a second choice behind all these other girls. What can I do? I'm can't feel so worthless for much longer.

TL;DR: My boyfriend constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and it's really messing with my self esteem. I have low self image and he always seems to find girls who are the opposite of me attractive. I'm at my breaking point and don't know what to do.

TITLE: My (f/23) ex-boyfriend (m/22) of 3.5 years is depressed, but I don't know if I should be there for him.

POST: Let's call my ex- boyfriend James. OK first off, I don't really know if he's really my ex, since we are pretty much in contact and he keeps saying he will come back to me when he's done growing up. 

So recently, James's father has not been well, and needed to get surgery. Living in Canada, health care is pretty much free, so hospital bills are not the problem. However, because of this illness, he will be unable to continue working for the next 3 years. James has just finished his bachelor in electrical engineering, but has no internships or related working experience. His mother who is also working, says she can't afford working alone to support their family of 5 and is pressuring him to find a job. I don't know what she exactly said to him because I wasn't there, but James last week, cried to me over the phone, saying he needs to find a job and grow up, and to do that, he wanted a break.

James, for the years I have been with him, has sort of slacked off, and would sort of treat me like shit occasionally, for which I would reprimand him. But I've always felt the need to help him however I can. It's partially my fault, that he has become the way he is, because I was the one pushing him to apply to jobs (I would make his resume and cover letters as well as apply for the jobs for him). He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them. Because of my success with finding jobs and his failure, he sometimes tells me "you're only getting hired because you're a girl". 

Anyway, he's been feeling really low on himself, but he doesn't really have anyone to support him except me, but he just wanted to be friends until he can figure things out. 

I wanted to distance myself from him so he could get the peace he wanted, but he calls me and wants my company, so I don't understand... Why he wanted a beak.

Should I keep supporting him, or do I leave him be?

TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend of 3.5 years is depressed after his father's illness and is struggling to find a job. He wants a break, but still calls me and wants my company. I'm unsure if I should continue supporting him or distance myself.

**Comments:**

* "You've been enabling him for years, and now he's taking advantage of your sympathy. It's time to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being."
* "I understand why you're torn, but you can't keep supporting someone who doesn't respect your boundaries. You deserve better."
* "It sounds like James is going through a tough time, but he needs to take responsibility for his own life. You can't fix his problems for him."
* "You've been with him for 3.5 years, and you know him better than anyone. If you think he's genuinely trying to grow up and change, then maybe you should support him. But if you think he's just using you for emotional support, then it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "You're not his therapist, and you can't fix his depression. Encourage him to seek professional help, and focus on your own well-being."
* "It's okay to be there for someone you care about, but you need to set clear boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You can't pour from an empty cup."
* "You've been enabling his behavior for years, and now he's taking advantage of your sympathy. It's time to take a step back and focus on your own life."

**Conclusion:**

The comments on this post are divided, with some people advising the OP to set boundaries and prioritize her own well-being, while others suggest that she should continue supporting James if she thinks he's genuinely trying to change. The post highlights the complexities of relationships and the challenges of navigating situations where one partner is struggling with depression or other mental health issues. Ultimately, the OP must decide what is best for her own well-being and whether she is willing to continue supporting James in his time of need.

TITLE: TIFU by almost getting run over by an ambulance

POST: So like many other TIFUs this happened awhile ago. I beleive it was my freshman year of high school when it happened.

I live near my high school so I always walk to and from my house to school. It's about a 10-15 minute walk, and there happens to be a small old persons and adult only hospital on my street. 

One day after school, I was walking home as usual. I had my earphones on and was blasting my music full volume cause I like listening to music as I walk home.

I was just crossing the street on green when I finally noticed that I was the only one crossing and even the cars had stopped. Okay? I though.

Suddenly I look to my right just in time to see the ambulance coming from my street break just before it hit me. It was literally a few inches away from me. I froze for a second, but then broke out of my daze and hurried by.

I still feel so incredibly bad for that, and since then I've never had my music as loud. And I've never walked with both earphones is either..

TL;DR: Almost got run over by an ambulance while walking home from school with earphones on.

COMMENT 1: Oh man, that's crazy! I'm glad you're okay. I can imagine how scary that must have been. From now on, keep those earphones at a reasonable volume and keep an eye out for your surroundings.

COMMENT 2: Wow, that's insane! I'm glad you're okay too. You're lucky it wasn't a worse outcome. I've had a few close calls with cars and it's always a good reminder to be more aware of your surroundings.

COMMENT 3: I'm glad you're okay! That must have been super scary. I've had a few close calls with cars too, and it's always a good reminder to be more aware of your surroundings. Maybe try using one earphone instead of both, that way you can still listen to music but still be aware of what's going on around you.

COMMENT 4: That's insane! I'm glad you're okay. You're lucky it wasn't a worse outcome. I've had a few close calls with cars too, and it's always a good reminder to be more aware of your surroundings. Maybe try using a pair of earbuds with a microphone, that way you can still listen to music but still be able to hear what's going on around you.

TITLE: After nearly a year of countless applications...

POST: I finally got a job! I've never been so happy to piss in a cup before in my life. I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!

And I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit. One post was something along the lines of: (Dealing with confidence issues) "Just fake it until you make it." Another post was a very informative post on askreddit about tips for when you actually do get interviews that said that s/he added at the end of the interview, when asked if s/he had any questions said: "What can I do or say today that will give me this job tomorrow?" (I totally said this!)

TL;DR: After a year of job hunting, I finally got a job! I'm just glad I don't have to take that over-night housekeeping job anymore. Thanks to Reddit for all the advice and support!

EDITS: I just wanted to add that I did get a call from the temp agency about the housekeeping job, but I had already decided to take the job I got instead. I'm really happy with my new job and I'm glad I didn't have to take the housekeeping job. I'm just glad I can finally say I'm employed again!

TITLE: Me [24F] with my SO [28 M] of 2 years, don't know if this is all in my head or not.

POST: Basically my SO and I have been together for roughly 2 years. Our relationship is fantastic, very open and honest. But, around a week ago we were sat talking on the sofa and he took his phone out to show me a photo of his cat. While he was scrolling i noticed a photo of a scantily dressed unidentified female in his camera roll. He clicked on it and was like "wtf?" and I was just speechless. Couldn't say anything, didn't know what to say or do. 

Instantly he said that he didn't know how that got there and was really confused. He genuinely looked really upset and confused by the situation. I said maybe he accidentally saved it from some website or w/e. He said that he didn't know and couldn't remember watching or looking at porn of said image. I pretty much shut down and just couldn't say anything else for a while. Eventually he tried to talk to me and apologised for me feeling so shitty and said that it was understandable I was upset. I was very upset, but managed to hold my shit together. We had a talk about it and I pretty much said that I knew he wouldn't do anything like that to me etc.. 

And to be honest I really can't see him cheating on me and having a picture of her on his phone or anything like that. And it wouldn't bother me if it was just an image from porn. But I can't help but feel upset and uneasy about it. I have a lot of doubt in my head, and I don't know if it's unfounded. He's never given me a reason to doubt him before. And I know I probably shouldn't now. 

Am I crazy to feel hurt?

TL;DR: SO shows me a photo of a scantily dressed female on his phone, claims he doesn't know how it got there, and I'm left feeling upset and unsure if it's a big deal or not.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not crazy to feel hurt. It's natural to feel upset when you find something that makes you question your partner's honesty. The fact that he didn't know how it got there and seemed genuinely confused is a good sign, but it's still a weird situation. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling and see how he responds."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's just a photo, and it's not like he's been hiding a secret life or anything. It's probably just a mistake or a misremembered moment. Try to talk to him about it and see if you can clear the air. And if you're still feeling uneasy, maybe consider having a conversation about boundaries and what you're comfortable with in your relationship."
* "I think you're overthinking this. It's just a photo, and it's not like he's been cheating on you or anything. If you're still feeling upset, maybe try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the fact that he's been open and honest with you in the past. And if you're still feeling uneasy, maybe consider talking to a therapist or counselor to work through your feelings."
* "I think you're being too quick to assume the worst. Maybe he was just browsing through a website or something and accidentally saved the photo. It's not like he's been hiding a secret life or anything. Try to talk to him about it and see if you can clear the air. And if you're still feeling uneasy, maybe consider having a conversation about boundaries and what you're comfortable with in your relationship."

* "Thanks for all the comments, guys. I think I'm just going to try to talk to him about it again and see how he responds. I don't want to overthink this too much and assume the worst. I think I just need to clear the air and make sure we're on the same page. Thanks for the advice and support!"

TITLE: I have to take an online class (no other options). The professor wants to do an online meeting. I'm a commuter student, and my internet speed is worse than most of the US.

POST: I failed a math last semester, but just found out- today- that I have to take it immediately again. Summer classes start tomorrow.

I already have summer classes to take, and am going to be doing the online math class before/after those. 

The problem is an email I got:

> I would like to have an on-line meeting on Tuesday, June 14 at 8:30 p.m. using my virtual office

My other summer classes don't last that long. I'd rather not spend another 9 hours on campus after that... I live off-campus, 30min commute on a good day. 

The biggest thing is that my internet speeds are ass. Just, pure ass. It takes an hour to load a 20min youtube vid at 144p. [Speedtest.net says my internet is worse than 98% of the US.] It's a data softcap. I get 10G of the regular speeds (1mbps) a month. Once that 10 gigs of data is used, it's back to ass speeds.

However, I do get unlimited internet from 12am-5am (which sometimes starts at 10:30? or 11? sometimes 3am???).

The local library closes at 8pm.

I don't know what to do, or what to tell the professor.

TL;DR: Online class, online meeting, bad internet, no library access, commuter student, what do I do?

---

Comments:

* "Have you tried contacting your internet provider to see if they can do anything about the data cap?" - This is a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle.
* "Maybe you can try to schedule the meeting at a different time when your internet speeds are better?" - This is a good idea, but the professor didn't give me any options for rescheduling.
* "Can you try to find a local coffee shop or something with decent internet?" - This is a good idea, but I'm not sure if I can find a place that's open late and has decent internet.
* "Have you considered asking the professor if you can do the meeting at a different time or if there's an alternative?" - This is a good idea, but I'm not sure if the professor will be willing to accommodate me.
* "You could try to find a friend or classmate with better internet and see if you can meet up with them?" - This is a good idea, but I'm not sure if anyone else is available or willing to help me out.
* "Maybe you can try to find a way to record the meeting and watch it later when your internet speeds are better?" - This is a good idea, but I'm not sure if the professor will allow it.

Overall, it seems like the OP is in a bit of a bind and is looking for advice on how to handle the situation. The comments offer a range of suggestions, from contacting the internet provider to finding an alternative location with better internet. Ultimately, the OP will need to decide what to do and how to approach the situation.

TITLE: TIFU by buying a safety razor.

POST: I'm the type of man that uses an electric shaver to shave and never have used a safety razor, but yesterday I saw Pawn Star Rick Harrison's single bladed safety razor at the checkout station in Walmart. It looked like a man's man razor and being the alpha male I am I bought it. I brought the safety razor to my jaw and swiped to the right it was the closest shave I've ever had in my life.

 After that I started shaving other parts of my sexy body and eventually it got the point where I shaved my beard,chest, arms,legs,ass,pubes, and yes even my balls after feeling like a new man I then hopped into the shower and admired my self in my mirror for ten minutes and then crashed.

 I woke up this morning and immediately I realized I fucked up it feels like I have sunburn and tiny paper cuts all over my skin and it fucking burns! My only guess as to what caused this complete fuckup was I didn't apply shaving cream when I was shaving or after shave is this what razor burn feels like?!

TL;DR: I bought a safety razor, used it without shaving cream, and now I have razor burn all over my body.

---

This post is a great example of the subreddit r/tifu, where users share their stories of "Today I F**ked Up" (TIFU). The post is a humorous account of the author's experience with a safety razor, which he bought impulsively after seeing it at a checkout station in Walmart. Despite having no experience with safety razors, he decided to use it without shaving cream and ended up with razor burn all over his body.

The post is relatable and entertaining, with the author's use of humor and exaggeration making it an enjoyable read. The use of colloquial language and slang, such as "alpha male" and "sexy body," adds to the post's lighthearted and playful tone.

The post also serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of proper shaving techniques and the use of shaving cream. The author's experience is a reminder that even with the best intentions, mistakes can happen, and it's essential to take the time to learn and understand how to use new products and techniques correctly.

Overall, this post is a great example of the type of content that is shared on r/tifu, and it's a fun and relatable read for anyone who has ever had a similar experience.

TITLE: Reddit: I want to lose weight....but am lacking the motivation to just do it...any suggestions?

POST: I've always had a slight issue with my weight. My lowest weight was when I was 16 at 109lbs and more recently when I was 24 I weighed about 122lbs, now Im closer to 180 (and I'm 27 now). I blame this on my sheer laziness and grad school life as well as my inability to say no to candy and yummy tasting food. This **needs** to stop though because I *feel* unhealthy. 

I used to be a gymnast when I was younger, and was super flexible...with this in mind, I decided to go to a yoga class 2 weeks ago and was absolutely wrecked after it to the point where I couldnt do anything physical for a week. I have lost all my flexibility and I'm totally out of shape :( 

I want to try a weight loss/exercise program that will work and keep me motivated. I was thinking about combining Weight Watchers with P90X...but honestly I don't even think I could do half the moves in the work out video. Other than that...I am a pretty attractive girl, have a bf who loves me no matter what, and I'm in my last year of my Ph.D....I just want to be healthy and less fat.

TL;DR: I'm 27, 180lbs, and want to lose weight. I'm lazy, love food, and lack motivation. Any suggestions on a weight loss/exercise program that will work for me?

COMMENTS:

* "Hey, I'm in a similar situation. I started with small changes, like taking a 10-minute walk after dinner each day. Then I gradually increased the duration and intensity. You can start with something as simple as that. Also, try to find a workout buddy or join a fitness group to keep you motivated."
* "I used to be in a similar situation, but then I started doing HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workouts. It's super effective and doesn't require a lot of equipment. You can start with 10-15 minute workouts and gradually increase the duration. Also, try to focus on progress, not perfection. It's okay to start slow and build up."
* "I'm a big fan of Weight Watchers, and I think it's a great program for you. The key is to focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes, rather than trying to follow a specific diet or exercise plan. Try to focus on whole foods, and avoid processed snacks. Also, try to find healthy alternatives to your favorite treats."
* "I think you should try to focus on your flexibility and mobility first. As a gymnast, you know how important it is to have a strong foundation. Try to incorporate some mobility exercises into your daily routine, like stretching or yoga. This will help you build up your endurance and make it easier to start a more intense workout routine."
* "I'm a big fan of P90X, and I think it's a great program for you. The key is to start slow and build up gradually. Try to focus on one or two exercises per day, and gradually increase the intensity and duration. Also, try to find a workout buddy or join a fitness group to keep you motivated."
* "I think you should try to focus on your mental health as well. As a Ph.D. student, you're probably under a lot of stress, and that can affect your motivation and energy levels. Try to prioritize self-care and stress management, and see if that helps you feel more motivated to make healthy changes."

This post and its comments demonstrate the struggles many people face when trying to lose weight and get motivated to exercise. The OP is aware of the importance of being healthy, but lacks the motivation to make changes.

TITLE: How do you deal with a dying friend?

POST: I made a friend back in the forth grade with duchenne muscular dystrophy more than a decade ago. Since then we have been best friends. I knew early on that he was not long for this world but there was never a given time line. I've watched him from being able to lift his hands above his head to not being able to move them at all. He's always been a good conversationalist as his mouth hasn't weakened due to his condition. Now 25 years old he struggles to sit up for more than an hour at a time. I just spoke with his mother and its beginning to sound like my friend won't make it to the end of the year.

I always pictured him dying of a quick complication or something sudden. I pains me to see him reach this state of being, not being able to do anything he loves but mentally all there to feel the pain and frustration. He has lived a pretty good life given the hand he was dealt, it just doesn't seem right for it to end in frustration.

My friend is a trooper though. He will sit through his pain in a room of his friends than to lie alone in his room sleeping it off. He had me set up his computer in his room so that his other friends would still have something to hang around on even though his confined to his bed for most of the day.

My friend and I are really close but his death has never been a subject we've discussed and I never hope to. I think we both enjoy discussing video games and televisions show more than wasting time talking about unchangeable facts. 

How have you dealt with the on coming inevitable end of a close friend?

TL;DR: My best friend since 4th grade has Duchenne muscular dystrophy and is slowly losing his ability to move. He's still mentally sharp but physically unable to do anything. His death is becoming more likely and I'm struggling to come to terms with it. How have you dealt with the impending loss of a close friend?

TITLE: TIFU by bathing in my cats' feces.

POST: Actually happened today!

So I had surgery last week to repair a torn labrum in my shoulder. I've been mostly lounging around and was starting to feel anxious, so I decided to start cleaning up a bit.

Eventually I come up with the brilliant idea to clean my basement, where my demon feline children house their litterbox. I decided that, because I was futilely attempting to clean in the first place, I may as well wash out the litterbox beforehand.

Enter fuck up.

Now an intelligent person would have seen the limits of their powers after barely half dragging the litter box to the dumpster 

and asking a small old lady to help me dump it.

Not me though. I got this shit.

After bringing casa de feces back to the basement I realize it's still caked in its fair share if shit, piss, and other goodies. I realize that the only way to remedy this problem is by filling it to the absolute fucking top with water and scrubbing the sides with an old rag.
Keep in mind that this is in and old sink probably about chest level.

After I had scoured the box clean and was satisfied with my concentration of piss/shit water, I then realized I only had one arm to dump every thing down the drain. No problem of course, 
shouldn't be any hassle whatsoever.

I was wrong.

After carefully starting to tip Shitanic to the side I immediately lost all semblance of control or a plan. As the entire container went over in one fell swoop I quickly realized the the shallow sink was not going to hold this cascading waterfall of terror.
Before I could even think about moving, but coincidentally just slowly enough I could open my mouth, I'm hit full on in the face with an Old Faithful of my cats' Seafood sensations lunch of yore.
Ever inch of me from head to tow covered in nasty ass piss and shit water. I even got the opportunity to taste some Friskies after extended marination.

I can feel poop in my eye

TL;DR: I tried to clean my cat's litterbox by filling it with water and scrubbing it, then lost control and got covered in a waterfall of cat feces and piss. I'm still trying to scrub the smell out of my hair.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that I've been getting a lot of "you should have just used gloves" and "you should have used a shovel" comments. I want to assure you that I was in a state of post-surgery haze and didn't think any of that through. I'm just glad I didn't get sick from it.

TITLE: [21/m] My girlfriend (21/f) asked for us to be good friends, with the possibility of getting back together.

POST: My girlfriend (or ex now) asked for us to take some time apart. But by time apart, she means time out of relationship. 

We met about 2 months ago and dated for around a month. This was the first relationship for both of us in several years and we were both very excited to start. However, she began feeling too much pressure. She needed time to think if she truly likes/loves me or not and she wasn't able to have that time. 

The strange thing is she wants us to be close friends. She believes that a relationship can only be strongest if two people are very good friends already before establishing the relationship. So she wants to become good friends with me first. We moved along very quickly but she still barely knows who I am and vice versa. Two months isn't exactly enough to get to know someone so deeply. She still wants to spend a lot of time with me. But she doesn't want the burden of a relationship just yet. She said that she doesn't want to be forced to like me just because we're in a relationship. She wants her boyfriend to be her best friend as well.

But the thing is, she said she wants us to be good friends before we get together again. I also made sure to point out that I'm trying to get back together with her, and she accepted that as well. We only met each other recently but we've grown extremely fond of each other. Just too much stress I guess. 

I want to know what to do. I want to know how long I wait before I try again. She didn't give me a time. These things can't be measured in a specific time frame. I really like this girl and she's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. How do I know if we can still work out?

TL;DR: My girlfriend asked to take a break from the relationship, but wants to stay friends and possibly get back together in the future. She wants to get to know me better as friends before we rekindle things. I'm unsure of how long to wait before trying again.

COMMENTS:

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's trying to slow down and get to know you better as a person before jumping into a relationship again. I'd say give her the space she needs and focus on building a strong friendship with her. If it's meant to be, it'll happen when the time is right."
* "I think you should take her at her word and focus on building a strong friendship with her. It's not about waiting for a specific amount of time, it's about being patient and letting things develop naturally. If she's still interested in getting back together in the future, she'll let you know."
* "I'd say take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. Use this time to work on your own personal growth and development. When you're ready to re-enter the dating scene, you can reassess your feelings for her and see if you're still compatible. Remember, it's okay to take your time and prioritize your own needs."
* "It's possible that she's just not ready for a relationship right now, and that's okay. You can still maintain a friendship with her and see where things go in the future. Just make sure you're not putting too much pressure on her or yourself."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and expectations. Let her know that you're willing to wait and see how things go, but you also need to know that you're not going to be waiting forever. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a relationship, and you shouldn't settle for anything less."

TITLE: My parents constantly check in on me (21F) when I'm on a date with my boyfriend (20M)

POST: I'm an only child with very over protective parents. I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months now and I recently started going to his house to hang out.

The first time I went there, I had a lot of fun watching movies until late with him and his parents. Late as in 2am. I forgot to check my phone till on the way back at 2:30 with 6 missed calls, 4 voicemails, and multiple texts if I was ok. I find that quite excessive. He's not my first boyfriend, nor my first serious boyfriend. I told them where I was going, so it wasn't like they should he surprised as he stays at my house till 1-2am. 

Yesterday, I went deep sea fishing with my boyfriend and family. I told my parents where and what boat I was going on to try and help out, plus the times we'd be out to sea. I texted them after I got off of the boat and posted pictures on facebook. After that, my phone dies and it was roughly 7pm on the way back to his parents house. I shower, watch a movie, and it roughly 11pm and I remember my phone had died. I plug it in and receive multiple texts if I'm OK, where I'm at, and a phone call. Then the texts start to get rude from my dad saying "Your mother told me you were shopping for her mother's day present, you better pull it together for her tomorrow whatever the hell you have been doing!". Obviously he knew what I was doing and I have already bought her something. It was just rude and was sent after I told him I was OK and at my boyfriends parents house. 

Is all of this excessive or is it just me? How do I handle this? I don't have to check in when I'm with friends...and I didn't have to with my prior boyfriend.

TL;DR: My parents constantly check in on me when I'm on a date with my boyfriend, even when I've told them where I'm going and when I'll be back. They're getting rude and it's making me feel anxious and stressed. Is this normal or is it just me?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Oh girl, I feel you. My parents are super overprotective too. I would suggest having a calm conversation with them about how their behavior is making you feel. Maybe they're not even realizing the impact they're having on you. Try to explain that you're an adult now and you can take care of yourself, but you still appreciate their concern."
2. **SarcasticSally**: "Girl, your parents are straight up creepy. Like, I get it, they're worried, but come on! You're 21, you can handle yourself. Have a talk with them and set some boundaries. Tell them you appreciate their concern, but you need some space. And honestly, if they're getting rude, that's just a sign that they need to back off."
3. **ConcernedCitizen**: "I'm not sure if it's just you, but it does seem like your parents are being a bit excessive. Have you tried talking to them about how their behavior is making you feel? Maybe they're not even aware of the impact they're having on you. Also, have you considered setting some boundaries with them? Like, maybe you can check in with them once a day or something, but other than that, you need some space."
4. **ExperiencedAdvice**: "I've been in a similar situation before, and I would suggest having a calm and rational conversation with your parents. Explain to them that you understand they're worried, but their behavior is making you feel anxious and stressed. Try to find a compromise that works for both of you. Maybe you can check in with them once a day, but other than that, you need some space. And if they continue to be rude, it might be time to set some boundaries and prioritize your own well-being."

TITLE: How does a guy fix the distance growing between him and a female friend?[M26]-[F22]

POST: I work with her, and she is a good friend. And I actually did grow feelings for her but won't say anything until I leave the job. The thing is, maybe I've been giving too much attention, because she doesn't go look for me anymore, or text me as much. She use to initialize the texts as much as I did. Maybe she already has a hint on how I feels? Overall how do you bring back that closeness you had with a female friend? She's fun to talk to and the thing I don't want is to become distant.Maybe it's the me withdrawing because of my feelings and I'm over analyzing.

TL;DR: I have feelings for a female friend, but won't say anything until I leave the job. She used to initiate texts and conversations, but now she doesn't. How do I bring back the closeness we had?

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: "Dude, you're overthinking this. She's probably just busy or going through her own stuff. Try reaching out to her and see if you can grab coffee or something. Don't overanalyze it."
2. **RelationshipAdvice**: "It's great that you're considering her feelings and not wanting to ruin the friendship. However, it's also important to be honest with yourself and her about your feelings. Maybe have a casual conversation with her about how you've been feeling and see if she feels the same way. If not, then you can still maintain a friendship."
3. **SkepticalSally**: "I think you're reading too much into it. She might just be going through a phase or something. Don't overthink it and just be yourself. If she's interested in you, she'll make an effort to talk to you. If not, then maybe it's not meant to be."
4. **FriendshipGuru**: "I think you're right to be concerned about the distance growing between you two. It's great that you're thinking about how to bring it back. Have you tried doing something fun together, like going for a walk or trying a new restaurant? Sometimes, doing something new and exciting can help reignite the spark."
5. **Anonymous**: "I think you should just be honest with her about how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, then you can still maintain a friendship. But if you don't say anything, you'll always wonder what could have been. Just be genuine and see what happens."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I might have been overthinking it. I'll try to just be myself and see if we can grab coffee or something. And if she doesn't feel the same way, then I can still maintain a friendship. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes!"

TITLE: I'm that other dude, too.

POST: Hey there Reddit.  

So about a week and a half ago I met this super awesome girl.  We didn't really hit it off right away.  Guys were swarming all over her.  She asked for my number and we've been seeing eachother and talking on a regular basis ever since.

A few nights ago she met me at a concert and we hit it off right away.  Dancing, kissing, grinding, the works.  For the rest of that night we were holding hands, acting like we were together and it really felt "right." 
She ended up staying the night at my place.  We stared romantically into each other's eyes, kissed quite a bit, and fell asleep in each other's arms

This situation seems too good to be true, right? That's because it is.  
She went back to her hometown yesterday to apparently see her boyfriend, says her roommate.  She told me she was going to see and spend time with her family.  

I don't want to be wasting my time on a girl who could do the same thing to me, but at the same time I am really falling for her.  
How do I confront her about this (or should I even confront her about this)??
Any other advice?

TL;DR: Met a girl, we've been seeing each other, had a great night, but she went back to her hometown to see her boyfriend.  Should I confront her about this or just move on?

---

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're getting played. She's not even trying to hide it. Don't waste your time, move on."
* "I'd confront her about it, but be prepared for her to deny or downplay it. You deserve better than someone who's not honest with you."
* "Have you considered the possibility that she's not even aware of her feelings yet? Maybe she's still figuring things out. Give her the benefit of the doubt, but also be prepared to walk away if things don't change."
* "I'd say it's not worth it. You're already invested emotionally, and it's going to be hard to get over her. Just cut your losses and move on."
* "I think you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. But also be prepared to listen to her perspective and be open to the possibility that there's more to the story than you know."
* "I'm that other dude too. I met a girl, we had a great time, and then she went back to her boyfriend. I confronted her about it, and she broke it off with him and we started dating. But it didn't work out in the long run. Just saying, be careful."
* "You're not the only one who's been in this situation. I've been there too. It's tough, but you have to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. Don't waste your time on someone who's not committed to you."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate your feelings. Are you really in love with her, or are you just infatuated with the idea of being with her? Take some time to think about what you want and what you deserve."

**Key themes:**

* The OP is unsure about what to do in this situation and is seeking advice from the community.

TITLE: I [26F] need help with dating and finding a good LTR. Tell me what to do.

POST: I've spent my life focusing on more serious endeavors and the last 4 years have been used to study for a degree, volunteer to boost my resume and so on. So most of my choices and actions were to set myself up for the future.

Now I have never had a serious relationship and don't know where to start! I've no regular hobbies to meet men, my friends are also having trouble with dating and my closest friends have also been perpetually single so they can't introduce me to anyone. 

I have very little planned for the next 3 weeks and now I'm going to let you all tell me what to do. I mean within reason. What actions should I take to meet some nice eligible men? Throw your suggestions at me!

TL;DR: 26F, never had a serious relationship, no regular hobbies, no friends with partners to introduce me to. Need help with dating and finding a good LTR.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm glad you're taking the initiative to put yourself out there! First, I'd suggest trying online dating. It's a great way to meet new people with similar interests. You can try apps like OkCupid, Tinder, or Hinge. Make sure to be honest and authentic in your profile, and don't be afraid to reach out to people who catch your eye. Also, consider joining social clubs or groups that align with your interests. This way, you'll be surrounded by people who share your passions. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out at first. It takes time and patience to find the right person."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It can be tough to start dating again, especially when you're not sure where to begin. I'd recommend taking small steps to get back into the dating scene. Start by trying out a new hobby or activity that you've been wanting to try. This could be anything from painting to playing a sport. Not only will you meet new people, but you'll also be doing something you enjoy. Also, consider attending social events or gatherings in your area. This could be anything from concerts to book clubs. Just remember to be open-minded and don't be too picky. You never know who you might meet!"
3. **u/lonelyheart**: "Hey OP, I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, but I believe that love can find you in the most unexpected places. I'd suggest taking a break from the dating apps and social media for a bit. Sometimes, we get so caught up in trying to find someone that we forget to focus on ourselves. Take some time to focus on your own interests, hobbies, and passions. You never know who might come along and share those interests with you. Also, don't be afraid to put yourself out there and take risks. You might be surprised at who you meet and what kind of connections you make."

**Common themes:**

* Online dating and social media can be a good way to meet new people
* Joining social clubs or groups that align with your interests can be a great way to meet like-minded people
* Taking small steps and being open-minded can help you get back into the dating scene
* Focusing on yourself and your own interests can help you attract someone who shares those interests
* Don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out at first, and be patient and persistent in your search for a good LTR.

TITLE: So I bumped into a homeless guy and he spilled his drink... am I an asshole?

POST: I'm walking down the street in New York, and there's a steady stream of foot traffic going in either direction. Out of the corner of my eye, I'm watching people coming at me when I bump shoulders with a guy and hear a splat of what sounded like some kind of drink behind me. Recalling what I had previously seen, it looked to be an emaciated man carrying an old black plastic shopping bag that I had bumped shoulders with. Thinking nothing of it, I keep walking. Then I hear someone say "excuse me" from behind, and realize that I may have knocked the plastic bag out of the homeless-looking man's hand by mistake. Two thoughts pop into my head about what might have happened: 1) this guy is trying to scam me, and probably "accidentally" bumps into people and drops things all the time, hoping that they'll overcompensate him for what they've "damaged" 2) I genuinely knocked something out of this guy's hand. In the case of the latter scenario, my response is still going to be something like "well, you should really carry your things away from oncoming traffic if they're that important to you," but I figure this homeless guy isn't the type who's going to listen to that kind of reasoning. So I ignore him. I pick up my pace to walk quickly like someone who's in a hurry, but not quickly enough that he could accuse me of trying to evade him. Then I hear "excuse me" again. At this point I'm thinking "fuck, this guy is persistent, and he's definitely not the kind of person I want to get into an argument with on the street." I also note that I'm only one block away from the subway station, so I decide to keep my pace up and continue to ignore him. I duck into the underground pathway leading to the turnstile and I hear it again, with heightened urgency: "excuse me." So I make a dash for the turnstile, swipe my card, and jump on the first train out of there.

TL;DR: I bumped into a homeless guy on the street, and he spilled his drink. I ignored him and kept walking, thinking he was trying to scam me. But then he kept following me and asking me to excuse him, and I got really uncomfortable and just wanted to get away.

---

This post is an example of a common phenomenon on Reddit, where users share their personal experiences and ask for feedback on whether they were in the right or wrong. In this case, the OP (original poster) is wondering if they were an asshole for ignoring the homeless man and not stopping to help him.

The post is written in a neutral tone, with the OP presenting their side of the story and asking for opinions from the Reddit community. The comments that follow are a mix of people who think the OP was in the right and those who think they were in the wrong.

Some common themes that emerge in the comments include:

* The OP's assumption that the homeless man was trying to scam them, which is seen as unfair and judgmental.
* The OP's decision to ignore the man and not stop to help, which is seen as uncaring and insensitive.
* The OP's fear of getting into an argument with the man, which is seen as a valid concern but also a sign of avoidance.
* The idea that the OP should have stopped to help the man, even if they didn't think he was trying to scam them, as a basic act of human kindness.

Overall, the post and its comments highlight the complexities of interacting with people who are homeless, and the challenges of navigating situations where we may not know what to do or how to respond. It also shows how the Reddit community can provide a platform for people to share their experiences and receive feedback and support from others.

TITLE: TIFU by not checking my junk email

POST: This happened today. If you didn't know, you need a letter of approval/visa to travel to Vietnam. This can be done easily by any one of the search results from Google. I knew that and paid for my visa well in advance. Got my confirmation email and didn't think twice about it until a couple days before my trip. 

I went back to my inbox to print out the letter, but it wasn't there. Searched. Nothing. Went through all my email accounts. Nothing. Curses. I emailed the company and tried to Skype them two days before. No replies. Panic mode. 

I went to another website that offers expedited visas and paid. My letter should've arrived with enough time for me to board. 

Nope. I emailed the company and they at least got back to me in a timely matter with bad news. Immigration had a meeting so I would get it later. Double curses. 
I did eventually get my visa and booked the next flight (on standby).

TL;DR: I didn't check my junk email and almost missed my flight to Vietnam.

MORAL: Always check your junk email, especially when it comes to important documents like visas.

---

This post is an example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, which is a common theme on the r/tifu subreddit. The author shares a story about a mistake they made, usually with a humorous tone, and often with a moral or lesson learned at the end.

In this case, the author didn't check their junk email and almost missed their flight to Vietnam because they couldn't find their visa confirmation email. They had to pay extra for an expedited visa and had to book a new flight on standby. The moral of the story is to always check your junk email, especially when it comes to important documents like visas.

The post is relatable and entertaining, and the author's use of humor and self-deprecation makes it easy to read and enjoy. The story is also a good reminder to always be vigilant and double-check important documents to avoid similar mistakes.

TITLE: Not sure what to do..

POST: *I apologize for the shitty, nondescript title*

Girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now, both early 20s.  

She was in a LDR with a guy for 2 years, and cheated on him a few times with these two different guys.  She dated both of them separately for a bit, broke up, but still hung out with them afterwards.  

She maintains an awkward relationship with them, and they clearly want to hang out with her still (and are most definitely still into her).  She wants to hang out with them too.  I do not get along with these two guys, they are shady as all hell.

We have a good relationship now, but lately these guys have been popping up a lot more often and it has been causing me problems big time.  

Is this normal?  Am I being overly jealous, or is hanging out with guys you've cheated on your ex boyfriend with okay?  I also will be away from her for a few months pretty soon, and I'm worried something might happen while I'm gone.  

I'm at a loss, I don't want to lose her but I really can't handle the stress this is bringing me.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on her ex, still hangs out with the guys she cheated with, causing me stress and jealousy. Is this normal? Should I be worried?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like she's not fully committed to you and is still holding onto the past. You deserve better than someone who can't move on from their ex and still has feelings for the guys she cheated with."
* "I think you're being reasonable to feel stressed and jealous. It's natural to feel that way when you see your partner still interacting with people they cheated on their ex with. You should have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see how she responds."
* "I don't think it's normal for someone to still hang out with people they cheated on their ex with, especially if they're still into them. It sounds like she's not fully over her ex and is still trying to hold onto the past. You should consider whether this is a relationship you want to be in."
* "I think you're being a bit too possessive. Just because she's still friends with these guys doesn't mean she's not committed to you. Maybe you should try to get along with them and see if you can all hang out together without any drama."
* "I agree with the others, it sounds like she's not fully committed to you and is still holding onto the past. You deserve better than someone who can't move on from their ex and still has feelings for the guys she cheated with. I would suggest taking some time to think about whether this relationship is worth it for you." (This comment has been removed due to its toxicity)

**Original Poster's Response:**

Thanks for all the comments, guys. I think I'm going to have a talk with her about how I'm feeling and see how she responds. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I'm constantly stressed and jealous. I'll keep you all updated on how it goes.

**Follow-up Post:**

UPDATE: I had a talk with her about how I'm feeling and she seemed really understanding. She said she knows it's weird and that she's trying to move on from her past, but it's hard for her.

TITLE: TIFU by moving my paraplegic wife

POST: This happened 4 days ago actually but I was so scared in the past days that i didn't have the hand stability to write on a keyboard

My wife and i had an accident and she's on a wheelchair (she started moving her legs again but still a long way to go) so it was nighttime and she asked me if i can turn her upside down, when i am moving her suddenly the weight of her leg shifts her lower body and i hear a crack... (like when you crack your back) the first thing she says is... I can't feel my legs.. I almost fainted right there, I try to calm her but I know what that means (I am en EMT) so i do the sensible thing... its 1 am and i have to call an ambulance.

Once we arrive at the clinic she's crying because she knows what this means, i speak to the doctor and tell her the situation, the doctor says "uff" confirming my deepest fears, she has X-rays done and an MRI, we had to wait almost 2 days for the specialist to arrive but i had already seen the X-rays and saw no changes on them, after the specialist saw the MRI said there were no changes, and we could breathe.

They sent us home with anti-inflammatory medicine and our regular exercise schedule, a day later (yesterday night) she said "Baby i can feel my legs again... i was happy and today she said, I can move my legs as i used to... I could finally breathe.

(Sorry if english no good, english me not first language)

TL;DR: My paraplegic wife asked me to turn her upside down, I accidentally moved her leg wrong and she lost feeling in her legs. We rushed to the hospital, got an MRI, and thankfully there were no changes. She's recovering and can feel and move her legs again.

TITLE: Is this fling fizzling?

POST: Both in our mid 20s. I have been sleeping with a girl for over a year now. We work together and when it started when she still had a boyfriend. It happened under circumstances I am not proud of.  She came to me when her relationship was fizzling out, and I think she needed me to see if there was any hope of re-igniting a flame of passion that she has not had in a while.  I was the other man for almost 6 months.  Then we decided that had to stop.  
We took a pause for a few months, but since we work together, we still constantly saw each other.  So when I find out she moved out of her shared apartment and broke up with her boyfriend, we start it up again. 

Things are great for a month, but then something happened.  I can't pinpoint it, but the passion is gone.  We both used to stare at each other with passion, and we used to make love with passion.  Over the past month, she has stopped doing anything romantic, surprising or spontaneous.  

I think I have a high sex drive, and I like to have sex everyday. For the first few months we had sex 3 times a day, but now, after about 4 months of this, we only have sex maybe 1-2 times a week.

I care about her a lot, and I was kind of hoping that it could be something more. She says she still isn't ready to get into a relationship, which I understand.  We had agreed at the start of this that we were just going to keep it to casual sex, but we both understood that we had feelings for each other. 

Not sure if I should just let her be for a while, move on or keep with it for a while longer.  Again, I felt like I was falling for this girl a few months ago, but I feel like now she is fighting it.

TL;DR: Been sleeping with a girl for over a year, started as an affair, but we took a pause and then started up again when she broke up with her boyfriend. Passion has fizzled out, and we only have sex 1-2 times a week. I care about her, but she says she's not ready for a relationship. Should I just let her be or keep trying?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like you're just holding on to something that's not meant to be. You deserve someone who wants to have a passionate relationship with you, not just a casual fling. Maybe it's time to move on and focus on yourself."
* "I think you're being a bit too clingy. She's made it clear she's not ready for a relationship, and you're not going to change her mind by being needy. Give her space and see if she comes back to you when she's ready."
* "I don't think it's fair to expect someone to maintain a certain level of passion or intimacy all the time. Maybe she's just going through a dry spell or is stressed about something else. Try having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling, and see if you can find a compromise."
* "You need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You're clearly invested in this relationship, but it's not a healthy or sustainable situation. You deserve better than someone who's not willing to commit to you."
* "I think you should try to have a conversation with her about what's going on. Maybe there's something specific that's causing her to feel uninterested or disconnected. It's possible that she's going through a tough time and needs some support or understanding. Don't give up on her just yet."

TITLE: What was the fallout after a person you were dating dropped "I love you," and you lied when responding "I love you too."?

POST: This happened last week, after dinner and drinks, and during sex. She said it, and I fucked up and responded in kind. Told her the truth tonight, and she stormed out. It's over. 

I feel horrible, but she did drop that on me right in the middle of a drunken melee. I should feel honored and lucky that someone feels that way about me.
 
We dated a couple of months last year and had only recently started dating again, and this happens. Tonight I acted like she didn't say it, and when pressed, I told her the truth. 

I only hope I haven't fucked her up too bad. She doesn't deserve it. 

I'll start another thread about why I'm so wishy-washy, but here's this: Has anyone else experienced this? How'd it work out?

TL;DR: Dropped "I love you" during sex, responded with a lie, told the truth tonight, and she's done with me.

TITLE: TIFU by being an Insensitive Jerk

POST: So like many others, this happened last year but I am still mortified as our office just recently had a congratulatory card recently that reminded me of the tragedy. 

I work in a corporate office building, and many times theres a designated person that walks around getting all the employees to sign a happy birthday, get well, congratulations card. 
One day I was extremely busy with audits, reports, reviews, and the girl designated for this card signing approaches me. As I am multi-tasking, she in her ninja ways sneaked up and whispered, "hey sign this". without any saying anything else. I didnt take a very good look at the card, and opened it up, and didnt really read or even glance what other peoples comments are and what they wrote, the girl asking me to sign the card didnt say what its for. 
I signed Happy Birthday! Enjoy - My name, gave it back and went about my work.

15 minutes pass by and I get a minute to breathe, I overheard one of my staff members talk to another, saying, its so sad.. I hope they are doing ok... it was then that I noticed I fucked up. I immediately got up and asked them what they are talking about.. and they told me so and so's mother passed away. 

It hit me... I just wrote happy birthday on a condolences card... 

I told a few specific people in the office hoping they would relay my apologies to the person I decimated with my insensitivity, but I never worked up the courage to apologize to that person face to face. No one has said anything since, but I am sure they hate me deep down.

TL;DR: I signed a condolences card "Happy Birthday" without reading it, and now I'm mortified.

TITLE: A bill paying trick that helps me track and lower monthly expenses.

POST: This may be obvious to some, but it has helped me get a much better picture of my finances. For years I struggled with paying bills, sometimes because of low income but just as often because I was disorganized. After making simple changes to my bank account structures I don't miss bills, have lowered my spending and can understand my expenses better.

The trick is pretty simple. Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses. Then go about setting them all on auto-pay. Most of the time you can connect the bank numbers or use a debit card to automate payment. If you need to pay an individual or have to pay by check most banks have a bill pay feature that will send scheduled payments by check.

At first you'll need to overpay into this account because your expenses estimate might be off and you need a buffered balance. After a couple of months you'll be able to pay in almost exactly what you need. Then you can setup automatic deposit to cover all your expenses.

Congratulations, your financial life is now completely automated. Did you remember to pay such and such bill? Yeah totally. Analyzing your accounts it looks like you're paying for a lot of online storage. Google sells space cheap. Consolidate accounts and save. Get hit with an unexpected bill? There's plenty of buffer in the account, just pay a bit more in to make up and move on.

It can take a while to move all your accounts over, but once you do the benefits of organization are massive. Also, once you make that one or two payments into the account per month (pay into it right when you get income) whatever remains is your spending / saving money.

TL;DR: Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses, set them on auto-pay, and automate your deposits. This helps you track and lower your monthly expenses.

COMMENTS:

* "This is a great idea! I've been using a similar system for a while now and it's been a game-changer for me. I've been able to pay off debt and build up my savings."

TITLE: I [20 M] am confused about my feelings towards my best-friend of almost a year [24 F]

POST: I met my current best friend online almost a year ago and we just got along instantly. We shared personal thoughts and feelings and got to the point where we talk every day, usually multiple times. We'll watch TV shows together on Netflix, play video games together or just talk when we're bored. We live a couple hours away (by car) but have spent two weekends together in person and both had a great time. When I met her, she was in a long term relationship and I was totally happy with just being her friend. She's recently single and I have been struggling with trying to figure out if I just love her like a best friend or if I'm in love with her. 

I've dated a couple girls in the past but have never connected with one like I have her. I'm just afraid of regretting losing this opportunity to see if we want to be more than just friends. At the same time, I'm afraid of "What if things didn't work out?". I wouldn't want a failed relationship to ruin our friendship. While her last relationship of many years was a very long distance relationship (different country), I don't think she'd want to jump into another one even if I only live a couple hours away. When she was going through her break-up, which she is still slightly struggling with, I remained completely neutral and was very supportive of her to choose whatever option that makes her happy. I love her and all I want is for her to be happy. But now, I find myself being sad at random times over the confusion about my feelings. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do so I don't regret my choice in the future? I could tell her how I feel, I'm not really afraid of whether or not she feels the same but more afraid of how her not feeling the same way would affect our friendship. I know she uses Reddit just about as much as me, and she would totally know this is about her if she read it, so I'm going to just hope that doesn't happen. I didn't really know where else to go to ask for help.

TL;DR: I've been best friends with a girl for almost a year, we've shared a lot and I've developed strong feelings for her. I'm unsure if I should tell her how I feel or not, worried about ruining our friendship if she doesn't feel the same way. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I've been in a similar situation before. I think you should have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. It's better to be upfront and take the risk of potentially ruining the friendship than to keep your feelings bottled up and potentially regret it later. Just make sure you're prepared for any outcome and have a plan in place for how you'll handle it, regardless of what she says."
2. **u/someguy123**: "I think you should take a step back and evaluate your feelings. Are you in love with her or do you just really value your friendship with her? If it's the former, then you need to have a conversation with her about your feelings. But if it's the latter, then you might want to consider whether or not pursuing a romantic relationship with her is worth risking your friendship."
3. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you should consider the fact that she's still recovering from her recent break-up. It might not be the best time for her to be dealing with romantic feelings from you. Maybe take some time to focus on your own feelings and see if they're still there in a few months. In the meantime, you can continue to nurture your friendship with her and see if your feelings for her evolve over time."
4. **u/throwaway321**: "I think you should be honest with yourself about your feelings. Are you in love with her or are you just using her as a substitute for a romantic partner? If it's the former, then you need to have a conversation with her about your feelings. But if it's the latter, then you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Remember that your friendship is important, but so is your own happiness and well-being."
5. **u/anonymous123**: "I think you should consider the fact that she's still single and might be open to the idea of a romantic relationship. Maybe take some time to get to know her better and see if your feelings for her are mutual. Just make sure you're prepared for any outcome and have a plan in place for how you'll handle it, regardless of what she says."

TITLE: Found postage, who wants mail?

POST: So yesterday I went to the post office to mail out some packages. I used the APC (Automated Postal Center) like I always do [saves time dealing with the lines]. I purchased some shipping labels and went to grab them below. At first I thought the machine had printed the first label wrong, but then realized it was an extra.

TITLE: TIFU by writing a fake TIFU

POST: So, I thought I'd see how easy it could be to write a fake and yet relatively believable TIFU.

About an hour and a half ago I had finished my masterpiece, ready to deceive all of you. This fake story involved me having sexual intercourse with two of my cousins a couple of years ago and some supposed pictures I'd taken on a disposable camera which i'd kept. The fake story went on, detailing how while I was away my mother decided to develop the pictures on said fake camera, as in this made up world we'd recently lost some family photos and she had hoped there would be some on there. In this fake story of course she went mad once eyed been developed and she's seen the non existent photos. 

So now you know about the fake story, I can go back to when I'd just finished writing it - happy with my work, I went downstairs and decided to take the dog for a walk, i was about 35 minutes. I get back, my computer was off - all cords unplugged, everyone out of the house, phone off the hook. Clearly, one, or all of my parents have read this and phoned someone or something. Sorry this is terribly written I'm writing this from my phone and not in the most coherent state right now. How the fuck do I explain this one..

TL;DR: I wrote a fake TIFU story about having sex with my cousins, but my parents read it and now I'm freaking out.

This post is an example of a "TIFU" (Today I F**ked Up) story, which is a common type of post on the r/tifu subreddit. The author claims to have written a fake TIFU story about having sex with their cousins, but then reveals that their parents read the story and are now upset.

TITLE: Is stashing a bag of dirt in my sister's luggage a bad idea?

POST: My sister and I have a game that's been going on for the last decade or so where we hide a bag of dirt among each others possessions.  She's going travelling in the fall and I wanted to hide it in her luggage so she'd have to cart it around for the two and a half months she's planning on going for.  I was wondering about possible implications with customs, other than a few odd looks.  She's going to Australia and the Philippines for sure as well as a couple other countries in southeast asia and I assume she'll pass through the US.  Would she get any grief about bringing in foreign contaminants or whatever?  I realize she could just throw the bag out if need be, but I don't really want that to happen.  It's a small ziplock bag of very dry soil with a bit of mulch in it, probably less than 25 grams total (<1 ounce).

TL;DR: I want to hide a small bag of dirt in my sister's luggage for a game we've been playing for years.  She's going to Australia, the Philippines, and other countries in southeast asia.  Will she get in trouble with customs for bringing in foreign contaminants?

POST: A little about both of us:

Together for 6 months. Its been a great learning experience for both of us and we come from similar backgrounds with a lot in common, however

I tend to push him in areas where he lacks like school and work. He appreciates it and says he wouldn't be where he was without me, however, he nags me CONSTANTLY about going to the gym (I go twice a day), my eating habits(vegan), sleeping habits, and grades. His are admittedly much worse than mine.

When I tell him "I like you the way you are and I want you to want to improve yourself first. I don't feel like I have the authority to tell you those things"' he tells me he holds me to a higher standard than himself.

I've encouraged him to come on runs with me (he's lucky enough to be in great shape, but who doesn't want to look and feel better) buy him protein drinks to bulk up ( he says he wants to), left him alone to study, make goals for the future to work harder, encouraged him to hang out with friends, etc, and he sits in the house all day and brushes it off.

What do I do if I finish college before him (which is likely) or bypass him in any areas of life later down the road? How do I make him want to be better before I think I'm too good for him and leave? Is this even normal?

TL;DR: Boyfriend (24M) constantly nags me (18F) about improving myself, but doesn't take his own advice. I want him to want to improve himself before I do. What do I do?

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it sounds like he's trying to control you and make you feel guilty for being better than him. You deserve someone who supports and encourages you, not someone who tries to bring you down. You're 18, you're still young and figuring things out, and it's normal to have different goals and aspirations. Don't let him make you feel like you're not good enough because you're not meeting his standards."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. You're 18, and it's normal to have different priorities and goals than your partner. It's not about being 'better' than him, it's about being yourself and pursuing your own happiness. If he can't accept that, then maybe he's not the right person for you."
* "I think you should have an open and honest conversation with him about how his constant nagging is making you feel. Tell him that you appreciate his concerns, but you feel like he's not taking his own advice and it's making you feel guilty and unappreciated. Maybe he's not even aware of how his words are affecting you, and a conversation could help clear the air."
* "I think you're being too focused on what he's not doing, and not enough on what you're doing. You're making an effort to improve yourself and your life, and that's something to be proud of. Don't let his lack of motivation bring you down. You're doing great, and you deserve someone who supports and appreciates you for who you are."
* "I think you should take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. If he's not willing to work on himself and support your goals and aspirations, then maybe he's not the right person for you. You deserve someone who is willing to grow and evolve with you, not someone who is trying to hold you back."

TITLE: My [17 M] new girlfriend's [16 F] parents won't let us see each other

POST: So me and this girl began seeing each other about a month ago, and have gotten quite serious quite fast and we are completely head over heels for each other.

The problem here is that we never get to see each other due to how overprotective of her parents are, she is literally never allowed outside the house. At first this wasn't too much of an issue, we'd skype everyday, she'd see me for 10/15 minutes after school at my bus stop (even this was limited as my friends would be there). Recently though, her parents have found out about me, and deemed that I am too much of a distraction from her studies, and that she is no longer allowed to see me or even Skype me.

We're now questioning where this relationship is going, and if there is anything we can do, because we're both so desperate at this moment in time. Unfortunately at this point she doesn't seem to be willing to lie to her parents so that's out of the question at the moment.

TL;DR: My girlfriend's parents won't let us see each other, we're desperate and unsure what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Have you tried talking to her parents and explaining how you feel? Maybe they're not aware of the impact their rules are having on your relationship."
* "I would try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her parents. Explain how much you care about her and how you want to be with her. Maybe they'll understand and relax their rules a bit."
* "It's possible that her parents are just trying to protect her, but it's also possible that they're being overbearing. Have you considered talking to her about how she feels about this? Maybe she's not as invested in the relationship as you are."
* "You might want to consider taking a step back and giving her some space. If her parents are this controlling, it might be a sign that she's not ready for a relationship. You deserve someone who is willing to stand up for themselves and their partner."
* "Have you tried sneaking around? I know it's not ideal, but sometimes people need to take matters into their own hands. Just be careful and make sure you're not putting yourself or your girlfriend in danger."
* "I would try to find a compromise. Maybe you can meet in a public place or something. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing. And who knows, maybe her parents will come around once they see how serious you are about her."
* "You might want to consider breaking up with her. If her parents are this controlling, it's not a healthy relationship. You deserve someone who is willing to stand up for themselves and their partner."

TITLE: I [M/18] am fed up with one of my friends'[M/19] behaviour. Am I thinking to much about this?

POST: So, I have been friends with this guy since 6th grade. Because he lives 14km away and went to a different school than I we only talk online in voice chat room and meet IRL sometimes at a party or go for a movie night with some othe guys. But since we both finished school this year and there is a 3-4 month period of nothing to do between end of school and university starting, we have been hanging out online every day. He is rather slow and relaxed, but gets pissed really quick if something is not to his liking, which, while playing online games, happens quite often.

 Now most of the time I am not the target of this, but when he sees me as the cause of his anger and lashes out towards me, I react and it ends with us shouting and one of us leaving. This happend about 4 times in 7years but when it does, he goes into his sulking phase where he activly avoids me and then after a week or so, when I want to talk to him, tells me that he needed "time away from me". And when he goes into his sulking phase I just know that this is the phrase I am going to hear sooner or later. The cause of our anger are seldom big matters, for example I joined a rival clan of his because they asked me to be a member while his clan rejected me although I know their leader IRL. Trivial, right? Or I denied knowing two close friends of his in front of a group of new people I met, because they made neo-nazi statements.
The current event was about him thinking of me as urging him to hurry up after he made some friends and myself needlessly wait on him and me calling him out on that.

So, r/relationship_advice. Are these just normal clashes among friends? Am I thinking to much into it? Should I change my behaviour? As someone who doesnt become friends with someone easily and values his friendships above all, this is an important matter to me.

TL;DR: I'm fed up with my friend's behavior, he gets angry quickly, lashes out at me, and then avoids me for a while. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if this is a normal part of a friendship.

---

TITLE: 17/m I'm the other guy, need help.

POST: Hi, I am a 17 year old guy in junior year of highschool, and the other day I might have done something not all that great. I have this friend named (lets call her Patrice) who has this really shitty boyfriend(lets call him Doug) who has forced her to do some really terrible things, for instance he forced her to suck his dick, and when she asked to stop, he told her to shut up and consistently sends dick pics to other girls. To further add details on this, she's extremely dependant on him and fears to be alone which is why she hasn't ended up breaking up with her. So, anyways, my friends have been trying to hook me up with her because they want her to stop dating him, I didn't really know much about her except for that she is really fucking hot, so of course I agreed. I invited a bunch of friends over to my house to have a party. Most of them didn't end up coming, but Patrice did. We were chatting it up, until I made the grave mistake of asking her to make out (don't judge me i'm an idiot).  She was hesitant, but looked at her friend for confirmation. She, the friend, said its fine, which then led up to Patrice saying don't tell Doug (I don't really know the name suits him), so we made out. Afterwards, she felt really guilty because she still thought that she still loved him even with all the things he has done. My friends still want me to go out with her, but I don't really know how to approach it. Any advice would be great.

TL;DR: 17 year old guy hooks up with friend who is in an abusive relationship, feels guilty and doesn't know what to do.

---

This post is a great example of how not to approach a situation involving an abusive relationship. The OP is more concerned with his own feelings and actions than with the well-being of the person involved. He doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation and is more focused on his own guilt and uncertainty.

The first red flag is that the OP is only concerned with Patrice's physical appearance, which is a shallow and objectifying way to view someone. He doesn't seem to care about her as a person or her feelings, only about the fact that she's "really fucking hot".

The second red flag is that the OP is willing to engage in a romantic relationship with someone who is still in an abusive relationship. He doesn't seem to understand that Patrice is still trapped in a toxic relationship and that his actions could potentially put her in danger.

The third red flag is that the OP is more concerned with his own guilt and uncertainty than with Patrice's feelings. He's asking for advice on how to approach the situation, but he's not showing any concern for Patrice's well-being or safety.

Overall, this post is a great example of how not to approach a situation involving an abusive relationship. The OP needs to take a step back and focus on Patrice's well-being and safety, rather than his own feelings and actions. He should also seek out professional help and support to understand the complexity of the situation and how to navigate it in a healthy and respectful way.

TITLE: Am I (19f) selfish for being worried about my boyfriend's (18m) sudden lack of concern about school?

POST: We've been dating for a little over a year, and recently he started to smoke weed again (he stopped at the beginning of our relationship because I had a problem with it, but now I don't mind, it's up to him, ya know?), and since then he's started to really care less about school. He hasn't gone to a single class in over a month, he sits around smoking and playing video games. I'm afraid for him, he had kind of a rough fall semester, and if he doesn't maintain a certain GPA he gets kicked out completely of the college. I really don't want to see him mess up like this, but the few times I've tried to bring it up, he tells me not to worry, he can make his own decisions, he'll be fine, etc. Of course I'm genuinely worried for *him*, and what his life will be like if he does flunk out but I'm also worried for personal reasons. Whenever he gets stressed, he tends to be kind of a jerk to me for a while. I get ignored, lashed out at, he doesn't want to be around me, and things like that which is one of the reasons I'm worried - no one likes being a target. I'm also worried because if he flunks out, he'll have to return home and that would effect our relationship. We've had disagreements about other things and he's told me that I tend to be really selfish in our relationship (even when I don't think I am), but am I selfish for being concerned about his school because of how it would affect us? Is there anything I can try to do to make him get his stuff together?

TL;DR: Boyfriend (18m) has stopped caring about school, and I'm worried about his future and our relationship. He tells me not to worry and that he can handle it, but I'm genuinely concerned and feel like he's not taking it seriously. I'm worried about how it will affect us and I'm also worried about being a target for his stress. Am I selfish for being concerned about this?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not selfish for being concerned about his future and your relationship. It's natural to worry about the people you care about. You're not trying to control him, you're just trying to help him make a better decision. Maybe have a calm and honest conversation with him about your concerns and see if you can find a solution together."
* "I think you're being very reasonable and caring. It's not selfish to want to support your partner and help them make good choices. Maybe try to have a conversation with him about how his lack of concern about school is affecting you and your relationship. Use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements, so it's not accusatory. For example, 'I feel worried when I see you not taking school seriously because I care about your future and our relationship.'"
* "I think you're being very understanding and supportive. It's not selfish to want to help your partner make good choices. Maybe try to have a conversation with him about how his lack of concern about school is affecting him, and see if you can find a solution together. You could also try to encourage him to talk to a guidance counselor or a mentor about his concerns and get some support."

* "I think you're being very selfish. You're not his parent, you can't control his decisions. If he wants to flunk out of school, that's his choice. You should focus on your own life and your own goals, instead of trying to control your boyfriend's decisions."

**Notable responses:**

* A user named "throwaway123456" responded with a similar experience: "I was in a similar situation with my ex. He was struggling in school and I was worried about his future. He told me not to worry, that he could handle it, but I knew he couldn't. I tried to talk to him about it, but he just got defensive and told me I was being controlling. It was a really tough situation. In the end, he did flunk out of school and it was a huge blow to our relationship. I think you're being very reasonable and caring, and I hope you can find a way to support your boyfriend without being controlling."
* A user named "relationshipadvice" responded with some general advice: "It's great that you're concerned about your boyfriend's future and your relationship. However, it's important to remember that you can't control his decisions. You can only support him and encourage him to make good choices. Maybe try to have a conversation with him about how his lack of concern about school is affecting you and your relationship. Use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements, so it's not accusatory.

**Overall sentiment:** The majority of the comments are supportive and encouraging, with many users agreeing that it's natural to be concerned about your partner's future and relationship. Some users offer advice on how to approach the situation, such as having a calm and honest conversation with your boyfriend or using 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements. A few users are more critical, suggesting that you're being selfish or controlling, but these comments are in the minority. Overall, the subreddit community is generally supportive and understanding of your concerns.

TITLE: Past issues I thought I had come to terms with came back to the surface and I wasn't prepared.  27M 20F

POST: About 10 months ago my GF(20F) of 1 year told me(27M) about her past as an escort.  It was completely against her will and started as just rapes organized by her at the time BF.   I thought I had dealt with this.  Literally didn't think about it for months now.  

Then we were watching Drive and she started acting funny when the shoot out started and as he's holding the girl down on the motel bed.  She was reacting to the gun violence, but it triggered my mind.  And it all came flooding back.  To be clear I'm not upset with her.  Never blamed her, still don't.  Her life was hell and when you have no support bad stuff happens easily.

However I can't stop thinking about wanting to bring harm to her ex.  I've caught myself looking for him as I drive to work (he works down the street) again.  Literally feeling sick today that this guy is out there walking around enjoying life like nothing happened.  Also upset with myself that I am this obsessed with wanting to crush someone's world when I've never even met him.

I love this girl to death, she means everything to me.  She's off her meds now and dealing with it herself so she's not as willing to talk about it at the moment.  So I feel completely stuck.  I've dealt with it before but I had her help.

Anyone have any advice?  We move 1.5 hours from home into an apartment together in 4 days so at least driving by the motels she used to be taken to is not going to be an issue anymore.  But that guy is still just down the street.  I know the obvious "talk to her" and will be, but right now I'm so stressed with Moving, work, getting my car fixed, etc to really have a proper conversation.

TL;DR: GF told me about her past as an escort 10 months ago.  I thought I had dealt with it, but watching a movie triggered my emotions and now I'm consumed with wanting to harm her ex.  I love her, but I'm stuck and don't know how to deal with these feelings.

---

This post is a great example of how trauma can resurface and affect individuals in unexpected ways. The OP (original poster) thought he had come to terms with his GF's past as an escort, but the trigger from the movie brought up strong emotions and desires for revenge. This is a common phenomenon known as "trauma reactivation."

The OP is struggling with feelings of anger and a desire to harm his GF's ex, which is understandable given the circumstances. However, he is also aware that these feelings are not productive and are causing him distress. He is seeking advice on how to deal with these emotions and move forward in a healthy way.

The post highlights the importance of acknowledging and addressing trauma, even if it seems like it has been resolved. The OP's feelings are a reminder that trauma can be complex and multifaceted, and that it may take time and effort to work through the emotions and reactions that arise from it.

The community's response to this post is also noteworthy. Many users offer words of support and understanding, acknowledging the complexity of the OP's emotions and the difficulty of dealing with trauma. Some users suggest seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to work through the emotions and develop coping strategies. Others offer practical advice, such as taking time to process emotions and practicing self-care.

Overall, this post is a powerful reminder of the importance of acknowledging and addressing trauma, and the need for support and understanding from others. It also highlights the importance of self-care and seeking professional help when dealing with complex emotions and reactions.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband[40M] and parents [60sF/M], married 10 years, Thanksgiving plans crisis

POST: My husband and I have been married 10 years and have two kids under 6. We live about 90 minutes from my parents. I'm not super-close with them but generally have a good relationship. 

For the last few years, we've hosted my parents and sister for Thanksgiving. We enjoy cooking and hosting, and honestly it's easier and more comfortable for the kids. We were going to do the same this year. 

But this year, plans are suddenly up in the air because:

* My mom just got out of  the hospital for something fairly serious, and is a little iffy on making the drive.

* My sister moved out-of-state over the summer and is driving back on Thanksgiving, but won't make it to their place until around 5 in the evening. My house is even further.

So my parents would like to host this year, both to save them the drive and so Sis can be at the dinner more easily. My husband says dinner can be at their house but he wants to make the turkey. I told my parents this and they basically think it's a lot of trouble. I also think it's a lot of trouble and borderline rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband was pissy when I told him this. My suggestion he talk to them and work it out did not go over well. (Possibly because I was pissy about him being pissy by that point.)

So, what should I tell my parents to avoid this turning into a huge fight where everybody feels insulted? I honestly don't care who makes the stupid turkey as long as I get to eat some.

TL;DR: My parents want to host Thanksgiving this year, but my husband wants to make the turkey. I think it's a lot of trouble and rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband is upset I told my parents this. What should I do to avoid a fight?

**Comments:**

* "I think you should have a calm conversation with your parents and explain your concerns. It's not about who makes the turkey, it's about the effort and stress it adds to the day. You can say something like, 'Hey Mom and Dad, we love hosting you guys for Thanksgiving, but this year it's a lot to take on. Would it be okay if we just kept it simple and did a potluck?'"
* "I think your husband is being a bit entitled. It's not about him making the turkey, it's about respecting your family's wishes. You could tell your parents, 'Hey, we're happy to help out, but we don't want to make a big production out of it. Can we just bring a side dish or something?'"
* "I think you should just let your husband make the turkey. It's not a big deal, and it's a nice gesture. You can always bring a side dish or two to help out. It's not about who makes the turkey, it's about spending time with your family and being grateful for what you have."
* "I think you should have a family meeting and discuss the plans together. It's not fair to put all the pressure on one person to make the turkey. You can all work together to come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with."
* "I think you should just tell your parents the truth. You're not comfortable hosting them this year, and you don't want to make a big production out of it. You can say something like, 'Hey Mom and Dad, we love you guys, but we're just not feeling up to hosting you this year. Can we just do something low-key instead?'"
* "I think you should just let your husband handle it. He's the one who wants to make the turkey, so let him do it. You can just relax and enjoy the day with your family."

**Conclusion:**

The OP is facing a crisis with her family's Thanksgiving plans. Her parents want to host the dinner, but her husband wants to make the turkey. The OP is concerned about the effort and stress it adds to the day and thinks it's a lot of trouble and rude to insist on bringing the main dish. Her husband is upset she told her parents this. The comments suggest that the OP should have a calm conversation with her parents, explain her concerns, and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with. Some comments also suggest that the OP should let her husband make the turkey, or have a family meeting to discuss the plans together. Ultimately, the OP should prioritize her family's feelings and find a solution that works for everyone.

TITLE: I [18/M] have made mistakes making my intentions clear to [18/F] and I may have made it unnecessarily complicated

POST: I have known this girl for about a year, and I am certain I like her and I am almost certain she likes me. She has done all kinds of things convince me she likes me. 

We had food together (just the two of us) a few weeks ago, she got tinder the moment I mentioned it in a conversation, and she kissed me on the neck and cheek at a party the other week. There seems to have been some attempts to make me jealous. My friends mentioned her and another friend was about to go into a relationship when that clearly wasn't the case, they were both clearly not really into it. When I was mentioned in a similar context she almost died of embarrassment (she hid under her arms for a few minutes and went bright pink). We have also told each other very deep and painful parts of our lives, and she has been very good with me about it and said she would always be there for me.

However, I think I have not been responding in the right way. When she kissed me I was tipsy and quite shocked so I didn't kiss her back like I really wanted to. I also told her I didn't want a GF a few months ago, when I did but thought that she was too high up socially, and later on she said she didn't want a BF for very similar reasons to me. I also got interrupted today so I didn't get a chance to ask her out like I wanted to. She seems to have been quite down in the dumps this week, and I have only talked to her twice. She told me some sad things about her and I wanted to hug her so badly, but If I had I think I would have been laughed at by others.

I really haven't got any idea of what to do, and I don't see her again until Monday at least. I don't want to ask her out by text since that is really impersonal. Ideas?

TL;DR: I've been making mistakes in making my intentions clear to this girl and I'm not sure what to do. We've had some strong signs of interest, but I've been hesitant and unsure. I want to ask her out, but I don't know how to do it without being too forward or impersonal.

---

**Community Response:**

* Many users suggest that OP should have a calm and honest conversation with the girl, explaining his feelings and intentions. They advise against asking her out by text or making any grand gestures, as this could be perceived as insincere or overwhelming.
* Some users recommend that OP should take the time to think about what he wants and what he's looking for in a relationship before making a move.
* A few users suggest that OP should consider the girl's feelings and boundaries, and make sure that he's not putting pressure on her or making her feel uncomfortable.
* One user suggests that OP should try to have a casual conversation with the girl, and see if there's a natural opportunity to discuss their feelings and intentions.

**Example Comments:**

* "Have a calm and honest conversation with her. Explain how you feel and what you're looking for in a relationship. Don't make any grand gestures or ask her out by text. Just be genuine and respectful."
* "Take the time to think about what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship. Don't rush into anything. Make sure you're on the same page as her."
* "Consider her feelings and boundaries. Make sure you're not putting pressure on her or making her feel uncomfortable. Be respectful and considerate."
* "Try to have a casual conversation with her and see if there's a natural opportunity to discuss your feelings and intentions. Don't force the issue or make it awkward."

TITLE: Am I [18F] overreacting about my boyfriend's [20M] relationship with his past fling?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while, but had a breakup in January after he started his first semester at a new school. During the time we were broken up, he had a fling with a girl over a period of close to two months. He would spend the night at her apartment frequently but as far as I know, it didn't progress past making out and some groping. She admitted she had feelings for him, and he ended the physical part of their relationship because he didn't feel the same way. We got back together in late June.

My issue here is that they are still best friends, and he hangs out with her, or her and her roommates (who are also his friends), nearly every day. I'm not a jealous person when it comes to his other female friends, but because of him being back in the place where our relationship ended and his physical involvement with this other girl began, I can't stop feeling horrible. I trust him, and I love him, but I don't know her well enough to trust her. His opinion is that I need to just "get over it," but that's been really difficult. I asked him if he could potentially cut down on the time he spends with her to two to five days a week instead of every day, which he felt was an "unreasonable request."

I know I'm being jealous, but the amount of time he spends with this girl is really bothering me, and the way it's causing me to feel is putting our relationship in danger. Help?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I got back together after a breakup, but he's still close with his past fling. I'm struggling to trust her and feel jealous when he spends a lot of time with her. He thinks I'm overreacting and won't compromise on reducing their hangouts. Am I being unreasonable?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Honestly, it sounds like you're not overreacting at all. It's natural to feel insecure when your partner is still close with someone they had a physical relationship with. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
2. **u/relationship_advice**: "I think you're being reasonable to feel this way. It's not about being jealous, it's about feeling insecure and unsure about your partner's intentions. I would suggest setting some boundaries with your boyfriend and having him understand that you need some space and reassurance. It's okay to communicate your feelings and needs to your partner."
3. **u/just_a_random_user**: "I think you're being a bit too sensitive. If your boyfriend is genuinely committed to you, he's not going to prioritize his friendship with this girl over your relationship. Maybe try to focus on building a stronger connection with your boyfriend and trust that he's not going to cheat on you."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "I think you're experiencing a classic case of'rebound anxiety.' It's natural to feel uneasy when your partner is still close with someone they had a physical relationship with. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on your own feelings and insecurities, and then have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Remember, communication is key in any relationship."
5. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure I agree with the other commenters. If your boyfriend is still spending a lot of time with this girl, it's probably because he's not fully committed to your relationship. I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this relationship is truly healthy and fulfilling for you."

TITLE: Dropping everything and leaving my life behind tonight, any suggestions?

POST: I'm packing up my shit and leaving tonight. I'm a 20 year old male who's been dicked around by just about everyone in his life ("omg 20 years old get over it"), and is sick of it. I'm not stupid, I realize this is a bad idea, but I really have nothing left. My parents have been promising to sign school loans for three years and have yet to fulfill that promise (which is fine, I don't care anymore). I have been living with my grandparents house and sharing a car with them for about a year now, which is making me feel worse, because who wants to share a car with their grandparents? I was going to move in with my girlfriend in a week and start a new job in the city, but she changed her mind and said she "wasn't ready for us to move in together" after knowing each other for 10+ years, so I decided breaking it off with her would be for the best. I'm not doing this as some pretentious, angst-driven statement against my parents or anyone else, I just want some different for myself, and this isn't cutting it for me. Anyway, my question is, any tips for someone who's about to take off with $200 in their pocket and a duffel bag full of clothes? Have any redditors ever done something like this before?

TL;DR: I'm 20, fed up with my life, and leaving tonight with $200 and a duffel bag. Any advice for someone about to embark on a journey with no direction?

TITLE: Should I (18/M) write to this girl (18/F) i met at the club the other night?

POST: Hey guys
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here it goes.

So this past week I was in a foreign country with some friends. We went to a club one night and met a group of girls and shared a table with them. 

This one girl and I started dancing and in no time we were making out. I don't know for how long, could have been 5 minutes, could have been 30 (too drunk to remember). I don't remember how we were separated either. 
We were supposed to meet them again the day after, but for some reason we were late and many of them just went home. She didn't though. 

They were three girls who had waited for us. We went to a bar that night and I sat down next to her. We talked, but the conversation didn't go to any personal level. 

We ended that night with a quick hug. The day after I (and my group of friends) went back home. I added her on facebook.

It has now been 4 days since the night we were making out and I just feel so empty. Now I'm always tired and quiet and just can't stop thinking about her. I want to write to her, but I don't even know if she feels the same way. 

So my questions are
Do I write to her or not?
If yes, what do I write?

TL;DR: Met a girl at a club, made out with her, didn't get her number, and now I'm feeling empty and want to write to her. Should I and what should I write?

COMMENTS:

* "Dude, you're 18, she's 18, just be honest and tell her how you feel. Write her a message saying something like 'Hey, I've been thinking about you a lot since we met at the club. I had a really great time with you and I was wondering if you'd like to grab coffee or something sometime?'"
* "I agree with the above comment. Just be honest and don't overthink it. You can also add something like 'I know we didn't get a chance to talk much the other night, but I felt a real connection with you and I'd love to get to know you better.'"
* "I think you should wait a bit before reaching out. You guys didn't really get a chance to talk much, and you don't know if she's interested in you. Maybe wait a week or two and see if she reaches out to you first. If not, then you can try sending her a message."
* "I think you should just forget about it and move on. You guys had a one-night thing and it's not like you're going to have a deep connection or anything. Just focus on your own life and don't waste your time on someone who's not interested in you."
* "I think you should write to her, but make it light and casual. You can say something like 'Hey, I was thinking about our night at the club and I had a really great time. Would you like to grab coffee or something sometime?' Don't put too much pressure on it and just see where it goes."
* "I think you should wait until you're back in your own country before reaching out. You guys were in a foreign country and it's not like you have a lot of common ground or anything. Just wait until you're back home and then try to reach out to her."  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

TITLE: Reddit, how can I deal with my bitchy roommate?

POST: I live in a two bedroom apartment with two girls in each room bedroom. Recently, one of the girls from the other room decided that the best way to tell us things was through passive-aggressive notes put in certain places as seen here:  (those are not the only ones). 

On top of that, she now decides that she hates my boyfriend because he comes over too often (in MY room, where she doesn't even have to see him), and because he doesn't lock the door when he leaves. She has called him a "douchebag", "faggot", "dick", etc. straight to my face, and told me to tell him to go home. She has no reason to even think that because all he's ever been is respectful to her and has even done favors for him.

The thing is, if she had been nice about it and told me directly that she had problems with something, I would be much more susceptible to change. But when she simply leaves notes all over the place and then blows up and bitches people out when things don't change, I have no respect for her.

What should I do? :/

TL;DR: Roommate is being super passive-aggressive and rude, and I don't know how to deal with it.

---

**Comments:**

* "Have you talked to your other roommate about this? Maybe she can help mediate the situation or talk to your passive-aggressive roommate."
* "I would try to have a calm and respectful conversation with your roommate about how her behavior is affecting you. Maybe she's not even aware of how her actions are coming across."
* "I would also suggest setting some boundaries with your roommate. If she's going to continue being rude and passive-aggressive, you need to tell her that it's not okay and that you won't tolerate it."
* "I would try to avoid engaging with her as much as possible. If she's going to be that way, it's not worth your time and energy."
* "Have you considered talking to your landlord or a resident advisor about the situation? They may be able to help mediate the situation or provide some guidance on how to handle it."
* "I would also suggest keeping a record of all the incidents and dates. This can be helpful if you need to escalate the situation and get help from a higher authority."
* "I would try to focus on the things that you can control and not let your roommate's behavior get to you. You can't change her, but you can change how you react to her."
* "I would also suggest being more open-minded and understanding. Maybe your roommate is going through some personal issues and doesn't know how to express herself in a healthy way."

TITLE: Me [20M] with my girlfriend[19F] 4 months, long distance ideas?

POST: Me and my gf met each other online and still have not seen each other in person. That has not stopped us and we video chat often, and even fall asleep to each others faces on Skype. 

I will be leaving for the military and am putting together an "Open When" letter box for her and stuff to hold her over while I a away. Yes, I know it usually works the other way but I wanted to surprise her.
   
Anyway, I will be putting things like photos and gifts. She is worried because she has gotten used to falling asleep with me like over the phone. I want some ideas on how to like... be there when i'm not there. I don't know about a video or voicemail that she will play on a loop because I feel like she will over play it and it will lose it's meaning. What are some ideas for a long distance couple that wants to feel like the other is there when we can't be?

TL;DR: Long distance couple, 4 months, military deployment, looking for ideas to make my girlfriend feel like I'm there when I'm not.

**Top Comments:**

* **u/throwaway123456**: "That's so sweet! I think you're on the right track with the 'Open When' letter box. You could also consider sending her care packages with small gifts or mementos that remind her of you. Maybe even a personalized journal or a photo album with pictures of special moments you've shared together. As for the falling asleep thing, you could try recording a guided meditation or a soothing voice message to help her relax and feel more connected to you."
* **u/longdistancewarrior**: "I've been in a long distance relationship for years and I can attest that it's tough. But it sounds like you're putting in the effort to make it work. I think the 'Open When' letter box is a great idea, and you could also try scheduling regular video calls or even just sending her funny videos or memes to brighten her day. As for the falling asleep thing, you could try recording a white noise or a calming sound to help her relax. And don't forget to communicate with each other regularly - it's easy to feel disconnected when you're apart, but making an effort to stay in touch can make a big difference."
* **u/relationshipgoals**: "Aww, that's so romantic! I think the 'Open When' letter box is a great idea, and you could also consider sending her a personalized playlist of songs that are special to your relationship. Maybe even a customized phone case or a photo blanket with pictures of the two of you. As for the falling asleep thing, you could try recording a gentle voice message or even just a recording of your heartbeat or breathing to help her feel more connected to you. And don't forget to make time for regular video calls and to stay in touch - it's easy to feel disconnected when you're apart, but making an effort to stay connected can make a big difference."

TITLE: Is there a chance that I [19/m] am screwing this up with my (19/f) girlfriend?

POST: We've developed an extremely strong semi-long distance relationship. She only drinks on very few occasions and only smokes hookah every once in a while. I smoke weed/tobacco, drink, and do other drugs almost daily. She says she doesn't care, but I still refuse to smoke a tobacco product in front of her. We both fully plan on staying together throughout college and eventually ending up together. She seems to truly not care and we both believe that I will calm down as I develop more of a routine and grow up, and I believe that at this age if we are to stay together this age is the last chance I have to do these 'wild' things.

TL;DR: Girlfriend is okay with my substance use, but I'm worried I'm screwing up our relationship by not being more responsible.

---

This post is seeking advice on whether the OP is potentially ruining his relationship with his girlfriend due to his substance use. The OP is concerned that his girlfriend is not taking his substance use seriously enough, and that he may be taking advantage of her tolerance. He is also worried that his substance use may be affecting their relationship and future together.

The post raises several questions and concerns, including:

* Is the OP's substance use a problem that needs to be addressed?
* Is his girlfriend's tolerance of his substance use a sign of a healthy relationship, or is she enabling his behavior?
* How can the OP balance his desire to have fun and be himself with his desire to be responsible and grow up?
* How can the OP communicate his concerns to his girlfriend and work together to find a solution?

The post also highlights the challenges of navigating a semi-long distance relationship, where the couple may not have the same level of intimacy and communication as they would if they were living together.

Overall, this post is seeking advice on how to navigate a complex and potentially sensitive issue in a relationship, and how to communicate effectively with one's partner to find a solution that works for both parties.

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 7 years have vastly different sexual pleasures. Is this something that will become a constant sore point for the rest of our lives?

POST: Me and my long term girlfriend have been together for a little over 7 years now. We have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years due to our studies. We long our virginities to each other and from there we began to explore a bit.

I have been watching porn for 10 years and have built up various fetishes and sexual desires. My girlfriend on the other hand had barely begun to touch herself when we met and had little to no idea about what she liked or what she wanted to try. So we used my 'knowlegde' to try several things and see what we liked.

During this time we tried several things ranging from your normal passionate sex to public sex and from mild bdsm to anal. What became clear after several years of exploring is that we both have quite different tastes. She prefers passionate normal sex and occasionally being restrained. I'm into things such as anal play and exhibitionism. She is very specific about what she likes now and I'm still very open and willing to do pretty much anything. This is starting to bring a bit of conflict as I become bored with all of these restrictions she has now put in place so that she stays in her comfort zone.

It's difficult for us both to enjoy sex to its fullest extent at the same time as I want to do certain things that she won't do and she wants to do things that we've done a thousand times and don't really excite me anymore.

I'm not going to pack in the relationship over this as I love her and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I want to know if this is going to be a source of conflict for the rest of our relationship, and if anyone has any advice or ideas regarding this?

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 7 years have vastly different sexual desires. She prefers normal sex and occasional restraint, while I'm into anal play and exhibitionism. We've tried to compromise, but it's causing conflict. Will this be a constant sore point for the rest of our relationship?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "It's not uncommon for people to have different sexual desires, and it's great that you're willing to work through this. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about what you're looking for and what you're willing to compromise on? It might help to understand each other's perspectives better and find ways to meet in the middle."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "I think it's great that you're willing to work through this. It's not about 'winning' or 'losing' in a relationship, it's about finding ways to make each other happy. Have you considered exploring new things together, like sensual massage or erotic photography? It might help to find common ground and create new experiences that you both enjoy."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I think it's important to recognize that your girlfriend's boundaries are not just about being 'boring' or 'unadventurous', but about her own comfort and consent. It's not fair to pressure her into doing things that make her uncomfortable or that she doesn't want to do. Have you considered respecting her boundaries and finding ways to connect with her on a deeper level, rather than just focusing on the physical aspects of your relationship?"
4. **u/sexpositive**: "It's great that you're willing to explore your sexuality and desires, but it's also important to remember that your girlfriend's desires and boundaries are just as important. Have you considered seeking out couples therapy or sex therapy to help you both communicate more effectively and find ways to meet each other's needs?"
5. **u/longdistance_loner**: "I've been in a long distance relationship for years, and I can attest that it's not easy. But it's also not impossible. Have you considered setting aside dedicated time for each other, even if it's just a few hours a week? It might help to keep the spark alive and create opportunities for intimacy and connection."

**Other comments:**

* Some users suggest that the OP and his girlfriend should have an open and honest conversation about their desires and boundaries, and work together to find compromises that make both parties happy.
* Others suggest that the OP should respect his girlfriend's boundaries and focus on building a deeper emotional connection with her, rather than just focusing on the physical aspects of their relationship.
* Some users recommend seeking out couples therapy or sex therapy to help the OP and his girlfriend communicate more effectively and find ways to meet each other's needs.
* A few users share their own experiences with having different sexual desires in their relationships, and offer words of encouragement and support to the OP.

TITLE: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?

POST: Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). 
* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.
* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. 

What do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. I'm in a bind and don't know what to do.

---

**Comments:**

* "You're not being a dick, you're being a responsible adult. You paid your share of the bills and did your part. They're the ones who took your deposit without your consent. Send them a polite but firm message asking for the deposit back. If they refuse, consider taking them to small claims court."
* "I'd suggest sending them a message saying something like 'Hey guys, I know we had a good run, but I'm a bit surprised to hear that you took my security deposit. I thought we agreed to split it 3 ways. Can we discuss this further and come to a mutually agreeable solution?'"
* "You should also consider talking to your former roommates about the fact that they didn't have a job and were relying on food stamps. That's not exactly the most stable living situation. You might want to ask them to pay you back in installments or something."
* "I'd be willing to bet that they're not going to return your deposit. They've already shown that they're not trustworthy. You should start looking into small claims court and consider getting a lawyer. You have a legitimate claim and you deserve to get your money back."
* "I think you should try to have a calm and rational conversation with them. Explain how you feel and why you think they took your deposit without your consent. Maybe they'll listen and return your money. But if they refuse, you have every right to take them to court."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for all the advice, guys! I think I'll start by sending them a polite but firm message asking for the deposit back. I'll also try to have a calm and rational conversation with them. If that doesn't work, I'll consider taking them to small claims court. I appreciate your help and support!"

TITLE: TIFU by accidentally overdosing on dextroamphetamine (ADD medication) on the day of my endwork presentation. [NSFW]

POST: So yesterday was a rough day. I still had a LOT of work to do, things like making the actual scale model of the home design I presented today and the powerpoint presentation.

I was able to make a presentable presentation, but only got 4 hours of sleep because of it. I think the lack of sleep is what caused my body to be incapable of processing my normally prescribed dosage this morning.

So today as I arrived at school I already knew I was sweating a hell of a lot more than I was supposed to. Feeling cold and sweaty is a miserable feeling. Though I assumed it was just a common cold or something. That all changed when I checked my armpits. Seriously I regret wearing a gray shirt today.

My armpits were just *drained* with sweat.

I could feel the sweat drip down my arm pits drop by drop every minute, what just made more nervous. After an hour my sweater was no longer able to contain the sweat, and it was so visible I didn't even need to lift my arms for people to notice. It didn't make me feel awkward towards my friends, I just laugh it off with them.

But then it was time for me to present my design to the external jury. 7 well respected teachers and architects gave me 30 min of their time for me to defend my work.

I just know that they noticed it and it distracted them and it distracted me. Too awkward for them to mention it. Too awkward for me to not ignore it. Yet I accepted the awkwardness and was able to give a somewhat terrible presentation because I got verbal ticks along with the overdose. But they loved the design at least after I explained everything twice.

After school was done I took a piss before I went home, which was also a bad idea. It felt like passing a kidney stone and gave me a throbbing painful erection for a good 30 minutes.

Now here I am, sitting at home because I can't stop sweating, feeling exhausted, heartbeat still around 100.
I'm just having a bad day.

TL;DR: I accidentally overdosed on my ADD medication, had a terrible presentation, and now I'm feeling exhausted, sweaty, and having a throbbing painful erection.

TITLE: Urgent: How to best take a beating in a fist fight?

POST: I only need/ can use advice about defending myself.  
  
Back story:  
I serve in the military (not US) right now, and have lately been threatened by someone, after an unfortunate exchange of insults.  
I am noticeably bigger than him, and none of us have practiced martial arts, other than basic melee training in the military itself.  
  
I tried to defuse the situation more than once.  
I can't "snitch" about it, because that would create hostility between me and his friends.  
I am near this guy 24 hours a day for the next 6 weeks.  
I cannot go on the offense in any shape or form, otherwise I will be sent into military prison and loose a bunch of hard earned privileges.  
My only hope to come out clean is to take a beating and wait until a superior comes to defuse the situation, with the other guy being sent to military prison and such.

TL;DR: I'm in a situation where I'm being threatened by someone, and I need advice on how to take a beating without getting seriously hurt, while also not going on the offense and risking my military career.

TITLE: Me [17M] with my long distance girlfriend [15F] of six months, I'm leaving for two months and I want to make it easier on her

POST: In three months I'll be leaving for Navy boot camp; in boot camp you can write letters daily, but that's effectively it for communication on the outside. Now, I'm sure we'll make it on fine through it, seeing as we're a very strong couple and the letters will make it much much more doable, but I was wondering if there's anything I could do or could send before (or after) those two weeks come, because I know it's going to be stressful on her part.

We Skype and sleep on Skype every night, always send big good morning texts to each other, and are simply very involved in each other's lives, and this is going to be a big change for her and I would really love to hear anything and everything people have to say.

Thank you for all the help that I may get, friends!

TL;DR: Leaving for Navy boot camp in three months, want to make it easier on my long distance girlfriend by doing something special before I go, any ideas?

**Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456**: "Hey OP, I'm a girl who went through a similar situation with my boyfriend when he went away for school. What I found really helpful was a care package with some of his favorite snacks, a cozy blanket, and a handwritten letter expressing how much I'd miss him. You could also consider setting up a countdown calendar together, so you both know exactly how many days until you're reunited. Lastly, make sure to schedule regular video calls and stick to them, so you both know what to expect and can plan accordingly."
2. **u/relationshipgoals**: "OP, I'm a guy who went through a similar situation with my girlfriend when she went away for college. What I did was create a 'countdown jar' where we would both put in a note or a small gift every day, and then open it together when I came back. It was a great way to stay connected and look forward to our reunion. You could also consider sending her a care package with some of her favorite things, or even plan a surprise visit when you get back."
3. **u/longdistancerelationships**: "OP, I'm a girl who's been in a long distance relationship for over a year, and I can attest that it's tough. What I found helpful was setting up a routine with my partner, so we both knew what to expect and could plan accordingly. You could also consider sending her a 'goodbye package' with some of her favorite things, or even plan a surprise visit when you get back. Lastly, make sure to communicate openly and honestly with each other, and don't be afraid to show your emotions."
4. **u/relationshipadvice**: "OP, I'm a guy who's been in a relationship for a few years, and I've learned that communication is key. What I would suggest is having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns and feelings. Let her know that you're worried about the distance and how it might affect your relationship, and ask her how she's feeling. You could also consider setting up a schedule for regular video calls and messages, so you both know what to expect and can plan accordingly."

TITLE: I (20'sM) think my cousin is going to tell me she (30'sF) is having a kid, I'm worried that my true feeling will show.

POST: My cousin is very close, like a sister, we were raised together.

She announced a few months ago that she and her long-time BF (30s) wanted to have a kid despite the fact that she has for her entire life said that she never wanted kids (we both had rough childhoods).

She has invited me and my Dad over to her and her BF's place for dinner next week, despite the fact that she almost never initiates those kinds of things, and that their money is pretty tight at the moment.

Other things (including the weird dinner invitation) have led me to believe that she is going to announce something big, and one of the few things I can think of are that she is pregnant.

I, for various reasons, don't think her (or her BF) would make good parents. I'm not going to argue with them about it, or make a big scene, or even make mention of my feelings. It's their decision, and nothing I say or do is going to change their decision.

What I'm worried about is hurting their feelings by not being immediately happy for them. She is kind of emotionally fragile, and uh... Histrionic?

I'm not good at hiding or faking emotions like this... It really has me worried. What can I do?

TL;DR: My cousin is going to announce she's having a kid, I'm worried about showing my true feelings (concerns about her being a good parent) and hurting her feelings.

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, it's okay to be concerned about your cousin's ability to be a good parent. It's not about being happy for them, it's about being honest with yourself. Just be genuine and empathetic in your reaction. You can say something like 'Wow, this is a big change! How are you guys feeling about it?'"
* "I think it's great that you're considering your cousin's feelings. Maybe you can prepare yourself by thinking about what you want to say beforehand. You could even practice your reaction with a friend or family member. Remember, it's okay to be honest, but also be kind and supportive."
* "I'm a little surprised you're worried about hurting her feelings. If you're genuinely concerned about her being a good parent, wouldn't it be better to have an open and honest conversation with her? Maybe she's not aware of the challenges that come with parenting and could use some guidance or support."
* "I think you're overthinking this. Just be yourself and react naturally. If you're surprised or concerned, it's okay to express that. Your cousin knows you well enough to know that you're coming from a good place. Don't worry too much about it."
* "I agree with the others, be genuine and empathetic. You can also try to focus on the positive aspects of this news, like the excitement of becoming a parent and the new experiences that come with it. Just remember that it's okay to have mixed emotions and it's not necessary to put on a happy face if you're not feeling it."

**Original Poster's Response:**

"Thanks for the advice, guys! I think I'll try to be genuine and empathetic, and focus on the positive aspects of this news. I'll also try to prepare myself by thinking about what I want to say beforehand. And yeah, I know it's okay to have mixed emotions, but I just want to make sure I don't accidentally hurt my cousin's feelings. Thanks again for the help!"

TITLE: My [24M] new girlfriend [21F] lied to me about using protection with other guys

POST: I'll keep this short:

I've been hooking up with this girl for half a year now, and we've only been official last month. When we were just fooling around, I told her that if she ever hooked up with other guys, I just wanted to know that she used protection.

There's this one guy in question that she said she blacked out and can't be completely sure, but she thinks she did. I trusted her and we ended up dating.

Now I find out from her friend (who screenshot their text conversation) that she did NOT use protection during that night in question. She clearly wrote it to her friend.

I feel like my trust was betrayed. I'm a little disgusted with this. She probably didn't want to tell me because she wanted to keep seeing me (and now we're dating), but she knows I'm serious about these things and I can't believe this happened.

Beyond that, we've been pretty solid. 

How should I deal with this?

TL;DR: Girlfriend lied about using protection with other guys, I found out from her friend's screenshot of their text conversation. I feel betrayed and disgusted. Should I confront her about it?

---

**Comments:**

* "Honestly, you should have a calm and honest conversation with her about it. Let her know how you feel and why it's important to you. It's not about being controlling, it's about being responsible and respecting each other's boundaries."
* "I would be really upset too. But before you confront her, take a step back and think about how you want to approach this conversation. You don't want to come across as accusatory or aggressive. Try to stay calm and focus on how this makes you feel."
* "I think you should be honest with her, but also be prepared for the possibility that she might not be sorry or willing to work through this. If she's not willing to be honest and take responsibility for her actions, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "You should also consider whether you're willing to continue the relationship if she's not willing to be honest and take responsibility for her actions. You deserve better than someone who is willing to lie to you and put your health at risk."
* "I would also suggest that you get tested for STIs and make sure you're good to go. You can't control what she did, but you can control your own health and well-being."
* "It's not just about the lying, it's about the lack of respect for your boundaries and your feelings. You need to think about whether this is a relationship you want to continue in."

TITLE: Ex-cheaters of reddit, is it honestly possible to ever rebuild trust with your SO? If so, how?

POST: A little bit of back story.

 So I've been with an amazing girl for over 3 years now but back when we met I was a stupid 16 year old boy who had just started getting attention from girls. So like an idiot i fooled around behind her back with a few girls and she later found out, and by later I mean 2 years later when I finally confessed. She always had suspicions but I was never man enough to admit to it. Now the problem is that even though its been a year since she found out there is no trust in the relationship. She doesn't trust me to do literally anything. If there are any other redditors who have ever been in a similar situation, is it even possible to get past this? I'm older now and I realized that she means the world to me and I just want to move forward in our relationship but it feels pretty hopeless right now..

TL;DR: I cheated on my girlfriend 2 years ago, confessed, and now there's no trust in our relationship. Is it possible to rebuild trust and if so, how?

---

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway123456789**: "Honestly, it's not impossible to rebuild trust, but it's gonna take a lot of effort and consistency from you. You need to prove to her that you're committed to changing and being honest. Start by being transparent about your actions and feelings, and follow through on your commitments. It's also important to recognize that trust is something that needs to be earned, not just given. It's gonna take time, but if you're willing to put in the work, it's possible to rebuild trust."
2. **u/cheater_no_more**: "I'm a recovering cheater myself, and I can tell you that it's possible to rebuild trust. But it's not easy, and it's not something that can be done overnight. You need to be willing to do the hard work of rebuilding your relationship, and that means being honest, transparent, and accountable. It also means being patient and understanding, because rebuilding trust takes time. My partner and I are still working on it, and it's not always easy, but it's worth it."
3. **u/skeptical_sarah**: "I'm not sure it's possible to fully rebuild trust after a betrayal like that. Trust is something that's built over time, and once it's broken, it's hard to repair. That being said, if you're willing to put in the effort to rebuild your relationship, it's possible to create a new foundation of trust. But it's gonna take a lot of work, and it's not something that can be taken for granted. You need to be willing to earn her trust back, one day at a time."
4. **u/relationship_coach**: "Rebuilding trust is a process that requires effort, commitment, and patience from both partners. It's not something that can be done overnight, but with consistent effort and communication, it's possible to rebuild trust. Here are some tips that may help: 1) Be honest and transparent about your actions and feelings. 2) Follow through on your commitments. 3) Be patient and understanding. 4) Communicate openly and honestly with your partner. 5) Work on building intimacy and emotional connection. Remember, rebuilding trust is a journey, not a destination."

TITLE: I want to join the police, specifically AFP, would joining a branch of the Australian Military help me?

POST: As said in the title, I'm an Australian, I'm 19 almost 20, haven't got my license yet and I'm working a dead end office job. I have always wanted to join the police though they said they prefer people 21 and older with life experience, so I am sitting in this shitty job with my shitty life, and hating it, so I decided maybe joining a branch of the Australian Military would help me, would that be something they would love to see on a resume?
If so, where in the military should I join? Typical Army? Become a sniper? Or maybe Navy, I want something active and never boring.
I know this isn't the most typical question, but I'm desperate, I need something new and have always considered joining the military for a back up plan but this would be something good for my resume when I go to join the police, yes?

Any information would be greatly appreciated, tips, inputs and just your opinion on the matter would help.

TL;DR: I want to join the police, but they prefer people 21 and older with life experience, so I'm considering joining the Australian Military to gain experience and boost my resume. Which branch should I join and what role would be best for me?

COMMENTS:

* "Hey mate, I'm in the Army Reserves and I can tell you that joining the military will definitely give you some great skills and experience that will look good on your resume. I'd recommend joining the Army Reserves instead of the regular Army, it's a great way to get a taste of military life without committing to a full-time role. Plus, you'll get to work with some amazing people and have some great opportunities for advancement. Just make sure you're prepared for the physical and mental demands of military life, it's not for the faint of heart."
* "I'm in the Navy and I can tell you that it's a great way to get some active and exciting work. You'll have the opportunity to travel, work on ships, and be part of a tight-knit community. Just keep in mind that the Navy is a bit more formal than the Army, so you'll need to be prepared to follow strict protocols and procedures. Also, be prepared for the possibility of being deployed overseas, it's a big part of being in the military."
* "I'm not in the military, but I know someone who is and they said that the Air Force is a great way to get some great training and experience. You'll have the opportunity to work on planes, travel, and be part of a team that's dedicated to keeping Australia safe. Just keep in mind that the Air Force is a bit more formal than the Army or Navy, so you'll need to be prepared to follow strict protocols and procedures. Also, be prepared for the possibility of being deployed overseas, it's a big part of being in the military."
* "I think you should consider joining the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). They're an elite special forces unit that's responsible for conducting special operations missions. It's a tough and demanding role, but it's also an incredible opportunity to develop your skills and experience. Just keep in mind that the SASR is a highly competitive unit, so you'll need to be in top physical and mental condition to even be considered. Also, be prepared for the possibility of being deployed overseas, it's a big part of being in the SASR."
* "I think you should consider joining the Australian Federal Police (AFP). They're a great organization that's responsible for enforcing federal laws and keeping Australia safe. You'll have the opportunity to work in a variety of roles, from investigations to operations, and you'll be part of a team that's dedicated to making a difference. Just keep in mind that the AFP is a bit more formal than the military, so you'll need to be prepared to follow strict protocols and procedures. Also, be prepared for the possibility of being deployed overseas, it's a big part of being in the AFP."

Overall, the comments are generally positive and encouraging, with many people suggesting that joining the military will give you valuable skills and experience that will look good on your resume. Some people also suggest specific branches or roles that might be a good fit for you, such as the Army Reserves, Navy, Air Force, or Special Air Service Regiment. However, it's also important to keep in mind that joining the military is a big decision and requires a lot of consideration and preparation. It's important to do your research and make sure you're prepared for the physical and mental demands of military life. Additionally, it's also important to consider the possibility of being deployed overseas, which is a big part of being in the military.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my GF[24 M/F] of 2 1/2 years, broke up and I do not know how to analyze my emotions.

POST: We were college sweethearts and we always had a solid relationship. She is the shy nervous type, but I loved that about her. After 1 year and 7 months I had to move for school, which led into a long distance relationship.

The distance really was difficult for both of us. She worked a night schedule and I worked a day schedule but we still managed to call every night. After a while, I tried to convince her to move to my side of the state. She did not really like her job that much (under payed) and I had a hard time finding a job on her side of the state (2 hours away). 

She expressed a feeling of not knowing what she wanted to do with her career, leading her to not be able to commit looking for work near me. She was always really nervous with decisions and really feared drastic change. So I didn't push her, even though the distance was getting too both of us. She has to do whats best for her.

Suddenly, that excuse ended up ending the relationship. She acted distant randomly as I visited her for the week (this was later in the week) and I called her out on it. She told me she doesn't know what she wants for her life and wants to be alone at this point in her life. She told me she loved me and as I left her house, I told her I hope shes finds what makes her happy and that I loved her. We were both in tears as I walked down her porch.

It has been a week since then and I am up-and-down each day. Happy,Sad,Confident, Self-loathing, miserable, ecstatic and most of all confused. I do still love her and I really don't know how to analyze what I am feeling. The breakup was out of nowhere. I just want to know that this type of things happens..because I personally don't understand it completely.

TL;DR: 2.5 year relationship ends due to distance and career uncertainty. I'm struggling to understand my emotions and feel like I'm stuck in a rollercoaster of feelings.

**Comments:**

* OP, it's normal to feel a mix of emotions after a breakup, especially one that was sudden and unexpected. It's like your brain is trying to process what happened and figure out what you're supposed to be feeling. Give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. It's okay to feel sad, angry, and confused all at once.
* I think it's great that you're acknowledging your emotions and trying to make sense of them. That's a huge step in the healing process. Remember that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.
* OP, it sounds like you were really invested in the relationship and were willing to make sacrifices for it. That's admirable. It's okay to feel sad that it didn't work out, but try not to beat yourself up over it. You did what you thought was best for the relationship, and that's all you can control.
* I think it's interesting that your ex said she wants to be alone at this point in her life. That might be a sign that she's going through a period of self-discovery and growth. It's not uncommon for people to need time to figure out who they are and what they want before they can commit to a relationship. Don't take it personally and try not to read too much into it.
* OP, I think you're doing a great job of acknowledging your emotions and trying to make sense of them. Remember that it's okay to take your time and focus on yourself right now. You don't have to have all the answers, and you don't have to be okay with the breakup right away. Just take it one day at a time and focus on your own healing and growth. 

**OP's Response:**

Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I really appreciate it. I guess I just needed someone to tell me that it's okay to feel this way and that I'm not alone. I'm going to take your advice and focus on myself for now. I'm going to try to be kind to myself and not beat myself up over what happened. I'm going to take things one day at a time and see where life takes me. Thanks again for your support.

TITLE: I [25M] cannot be myself around my family, because everything I do is "strange".

POST: I am a senior biochemistry major, enjoy old music - huge deadhead- and really love writing. However, my family is nothing like me. They are narrow-minded straight ticket Republican voters, none of them have ever gone to college, and they all love modern pop country music; not that I mind, I just think that says a lot about a person.

Now, I could deal with those differences if they stopped there. The deeper issues are grounded in their ignorance of my intrinsic personality and their obstinacy towards simply trying to understand. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features in high school and then Bipolar 1 later on. On many days, all I can do is lie in the dark and list reasons to continue living.

This frequent inability to do anything is viewed as lazy by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. However, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.

I have stayed with friends on multiple occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.

I really just want to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented on. How do I get out of this mindset and become the person I want to be?

TL;DR: I'm a 25-year-old biochemistry major with depression and bipolar disorder. My family is super conservative and doesn't understand me. They think I'm lazy and don't believe I can make it on my own. I feel like I have to hide my true self around them. How can I break free from this and be myself?

**Top comments:**

* "You're not alone, OP. I'm a 30-year-old with anxiety and depression, and I've been in similar situations. It's hard to break free, but you need to prioritize your own well-being. Consider seeking professional help, and don't be afraid to set boundaries with your family. You deserve to be yourself and live a happy life."
* "I'm a huge Deadhead too! Anyway, OP, it sounds like you're in a toxic environment. You need to take care of yourself and surround yourself with people who accept and support you. Don't worry about what your family thinks; they're not your friends. You're strong and capable, and you can make it on your own."
* "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault that your family doesn't understand you. You're not lazy, and you're not broken. You're just different, and that's okay. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies. And remember, you're not alone – there are people who care about you and want to support you."
* "OP, I think you need to take a step back and assess your relationships with your family. Are they truly toxic, or are they just...different? Sometimes, people don't understand us because they're not used to our way of thinking or living. Maybe you can try to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and needs. Who knows, they might surprise you and be more understanding than you think."
* "OP, I'm a big fan of the Deadheads too! Anyway, I think you need to focus on building a support network outside of your family. Find people who share your interests and values, and who will accept you for who you are. You don't need your family's approval to be happy and fulfilled. You're an amazing person, and you deserve to live a life that's true to yourself."

TITLE: I think I have some form of PTSD?

POST: I'm not sure if that's what it is. Sorry if that's offensive to call it that when it's probably something else. 

July of last year, my friend was texting me constantly on her roadtrip. Her friend rolled their car and my friend was rushed to the hospital and went into a coma for a few weeks. She ended up being ok but I originally thought she was ignoring me or lost service. In September, I was texting a friend of mine when she fell asleep and died in a house fire. I didn't know about the fire until a few days later, I kept texting her thinking she was ignoring me. Two months ago, I had text my friend in the morning and he agreed to meet me at my house later that afternoon to hang out. When he didn't show up, I kept texting him and calling him. I thought he was ignoring me, turns out he had killed himself a few hours before. 

Now whenever I'm texting someone and they don't reply within a few hours I freak out. I panic, start crying, call them, call someone who might know if they are still alive/ok. Basically full blow panic attacks. It's really embarrassing when they tell me to stop freaking out they just fell asleep/lost their phone/were riding unicorns. Should I talk to someone about this? Just get over myself?

TL;DR: I'm having trouble with anxiety/PTSD after experiencing multiple traumatic events involving friends. I'm worried about my reactions to not hearing back from people and feel embarrassed about it.

TITLE: Me [26/F] with my boyfriend [28 M] 2 years;Will he propose on vacation?/Why won't people stop asking me that?

POST: BF and I are headed on a two week vacation to Europe, leaving Friday. We have lived together for six months, been together two years, and many of our friends are now married or engaged. 

Getting engaged on vacation seems to be en vogue these days. So now, I've had multiple friends, and most recently my father(!) as me if we're getting engaged on this trip. 

This is terrible for a number of reasons. 

1) Thanks friends for putting that thought in my mind!! 
2) How do I know? 

Anyway, I am ready to be engaged. He is my one. We've discussed everything from parenting styles to wedding seating (if you have aunts Sandy, Irene, Rita and Katrina, you HAVE to have a hurricane table, right??). 

He is financially comfortable, we are both at stable places in our lives, and we are very happy. So is he going to do it? 

But I also don't know if he is ready, and that is fine with me! I would very enthusiastically say yes if he asked, but I wouldn't want to actually tie the knot until at least 2016. 

The problem:...these people have put the thought in my head! Now I'm afraid I'll ruin my vacation by expecting something at every romantic moment. How do I deal with this? How do I brush it off and just enjoy my vacation?

TL;DR: My friends and family are asking if my boyfriend will propose on our two-week European vacation. I'm worried about ruining the trip by expecting something at every romantic moment. How do I deal with this?

**Comments:**

* "Girl, I feel you! My friends were asking me the same thing when I went on a vacation with my boyfriend last year. Just remember that you can't control what others think, but you can control how you react to it. Try to focus on the present moment and enjoy your vacation with your boyfriend. If he does propose, that's amazing, but if not, it's not the end of the world. You're with someone who loves you, and that's what matters most."
* "I think it's sweet that your friends and family are excited for you, but maybe you can set the record straight and tell them that you're not expecting a proposal. You can say something like, 'We're just going on a vacation to relax and have some fun, and we're not planning on getting engaged anytime soon.' That way, you can put their minds at ease and avoid any unnecessary pressure."
* "I'm a guy, and I have to say that I think it's pretty cool that your boyfriend is financially comfortable and you're both stable in your lives. That's a great foundation for a relationship. As for the proposal, I think it's up to him to decide when he's ready. You can't force someone to propose, and it's not fair to put pressure on him. Just enjoy your vacation and see what happens."
* "I think it's great that you're thinking about your future together, but you can't control what others think. Just focus on the present moment and enjoy your vacation with your boyfriend. If he does propose, that's amazing, but if not, it's not the end of the world. You're with someone who loves you, and that's what matters most."

**Conclusion:**

The post is about a woman who is worried about ruining her vacation by expecting a proposal from her boyfriend at every romantic moment.

TITLE: Hearing Issues...

POST: Hello!

I am a 28 year old male that has had ongoing issues hearing people talking, on tv and directly to me.  I hear other noises, but talking is somewhat difficult, especially if there is any other noise going on at the same time.

i.e., I'm listening to music on my computer, next to a window that is very minimally open.  I'm about 50 or more feet away from the cars driving past, but when they do, my music goes into a muffled sound and I can't make out the words being sung.

Additionally, talking to people, I'm constantly being asked to repeat myself.  I'm also been told to turn the TV down pretty often.

I'm not on any medication that would be causing these issues.

TL;DR: I have trouble hearing people talk, especially in noisy environments.  I also have trouble hearing music when there is background noise.

Do any of you have any ideas what could be causing this?  I've been to an audiologist and they said my hearing is normal, but I'm not convinced.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

---

REPLIES:

1. **Dr. Audiologist**: Hi there! I'm an audiologist, and I'd be happy to help you out. It's great that you've already had an audiogram and your hearing is normal. However, there are other factors that could be contributing to your difficulty hearing. Have you considered getting a hearing test in a noisy environment? This could help us identify if you have any issues with speech recognition in noise. Additionally, have you tried using hearing aids or assistive listening devices? These can be very helpful in improving speech recognition in noisy environments.

2. **Dr. ENT**: Hi! I'm an ear, nose, and throat specialist. I'd like to suggest that you may have a condition called auditory processing disorder (APD). APD is a condition where the brain has trouble processing auditory information, even though the ears are functioning normally. This can cause difficulties with hearing speech in noisy environments, as well as trouble following conversations. If you're interested, I can refer you to a specialist who can evaluate you for APD.

3. **Dr. General Practitioner**: Hi! I'm a general practitioner, and I'd like to suggest that you may have a condition called tinnitus. Tinnitus is a condition where you hear ringing or other sounds in your ears, even when there's no external noise. It's not uncommon for people with tinnitus to also have difficulty hearing speech in noisy environments. If you're interested, I can refer you to an audiologist who can evaluate you for tinnitus.

4. **Other Redditors**: Hi! I'm not a doctor, but I have a similar issue. I've found that using a hearing aid or assistive listening device has really helped me. I also try to sit in a quiet spot when watching TV or listening to music, and I avoid noisy environments as much as possible. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

TITLE: I [F22] just started dating my friend [M23] and I'm uncomfortable by his attitude towards his female friends/other women.

POST: So my friend and I recently decided to start dating. We had a casual, non-exclusive relationship for a few weeks, and last night I told him I wanted to be exclusive.

The thing is, he talks a lot about how attracted he is to other women. He told me pretty much any time a woman is wearing X or Y, regardless of who she is, he'll be horny. He keeps a lot of female friends on Facebook simply so he can look at their pictures (and I guess masturbate to them, I dunno, based on what he's told me before). He still talks to his ex's. 

And last night, after I had said I wanted to be exclusive and we were talking about something else, he said something along the lines of, "The physical half of my would fuck anyone who would fuck me. I'd fuck a pile of dirt if it felt good."

Am I weird for being upset by this? I understand being attracted to other people is part of life, and that doesn't bother me. I don't mind him watching porn or anything like that. It's the attitude of being willing to fuck pretty much anything that moves, having sexual feelings towards his female friends… I guess it's more personal than I'm comfortable with.

It just made me feel really shitty. Is this normal? Am I supposed to be okay with this stuff? I don't think he'd cheat on me, but I guess it makes me feel like sex with him is nothing special, and I don't like that feeling in a relationship. All of this just came to light last night after I told him I wanted to be exclusive. If I had known this stuff beforehand, I'm not sure I would've jumped into it.

TL;DR: I'm F22, started dating M23, and I'm uncomfortable with his attitude towards other women. He talks about being attracted to anyone, has female friends on Facebook for the sole purpose of looking at their pictures, and has a "fuck anything that feels good" attitude. I feel like sex with him is nothing special and it makes me feel bad. Am I being unreasonable?

**Comments:**

* "You're not being unreasonable at all. It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable with someone's attitude towards sex and relationships, especially when it's someone you're in a relationship with. You deserve to feel valued and respected in your relationship, and it sounds like his attitude is not doing that for you."
* "I think it's great that you're having this conversation with him. It's better to address these issues now rather than later. You should talk to him about how his attitude is making you feel and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you."
* "I'm a guy and I have to say, I would be really turned off by someone who has this attitude. It's not just about being attracted to other people, it's about respecting your partner and the relationship you're in. If he can't do that, then maybe you're better off without him."
* "I think you should take a step back and think about what you want from this relationship. Do you want to be with someone who is going to prioritize your feelings and needs, or do you want to be with someone who is going to prioritize their own desires and impulses? It's a tough decision, but it's one you need to make."
* "I'm a woman and I have to say, I would be really uncomfortable with someone who has this attitude. It's not just about being attracted to other people, it's about respecting your partner and the relationship you're in. If he can't do that, then maybe you're better off without him."

TITLE: Me [20F] with my ___ [20 M] 1 year 8 months, broke up three months ago, I can't get over it.

POST: I asked my now ex-boyfriend for a break while he was backpacking for a month after having been abroad for two months. I felt neglected and powerless. The relationship seemed entirely one-sided. I needed time to think if he was what I really wanted. We didn't talk for six weeks. When we finally talked, he was not interested in addressing the core issue. He implied that he didn't love me as much as I loved him. I can't seem to get over how much that hurt. 

I keep waking up, three months later, forgetting that we've broken up. Then I realize and get emotional. I know that he is what I want. I've known it for a while, I told him and he wanted nothing to do with me. I just feel like a terrible person for everything that happened. I hate myself. I just want him to be happy but I can't seem to move on. I really need help. I have a previous issue with self-mutilation (but I haven't cut in four years).
Any advice for moving on with my life?

TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend three months ago, still struggling to get over it. I know I deserve better, but I keep thinking about him and feeling guilty. Need help moving on.

TITLE: Me [23M] with my GF [21F] 10 months distance relationship, need your point of view of this breakup

POST: Hey. I and my GF have been together for around 1 months. The probem is the distance between us, and we will have the distance between us for another 10-15 months(minimum) so it is really hard and annoying. The problems I am facing is, she is so deep in love with me, it hurts to see her in pain because of the distance, I have a lot of problems at home right now so can't really visit her or vice versa, but we tak around once a week now. We used to talk around 5-10 times a week before, but it is not possible due to my problems at home. She has asked for a pause before because she was have been in pain for so long, I said that we will fix it. Time has passed since then, and I have realised that my problems at might be for another 3 months at least. My thought was to break u, so she can be free from the pain I have caused, but when I talked with her about it I realised that she will be in more pain if I break up. But somewhere deep inside me I know it will be better to let her go, she might be in deeper pain for a month or so, but it will slowly get better. Instead of being with me in pain everyday, until we can move in together. 
I would really like to have your advice and point of view, am I thinking like an idiot? Am I thinking right? Do you have tips to solve this problem even better than a break up?

TL;DR: Me and my GF have been together for 10 months, but we are in a distance relationship for another 10-15 months. I'm struggling with my problems at home and can't visit her, and she's in pain because of the distance. I'm thinking of breaking up with her to spare her pain, but I'm unsure if it's the right decision.

**Top Comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "I think you're being really selfless by considering breaking up with her to spare her pain. However, you also need to think about your own feelings and what you want. Are you willing to work through the challenges of a long-distance relationship, or do you feel like it's too much for you right now? It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns."
2. **u/relationshipadvice**: "I think you're making a huge mistake by considering breaking up with her. You're not doing this for her, you're doing it for yourself. You're not willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work, and you're using her pain as an excuse. Instead of breaking up with her, why not try to find ways to make the distance more manageable? You could schedule regular video calls, send surprise gifts, or even plan visits when you can. It's not easy, but it's worth it if you truly care about her."
3. **u/sadpanda123**: "I'm in a similar situation, and I can totally relate to your feelings. It's hard to see your partner in pain, and it's even harder to be apart from them. But, I think you're making a mistake by considering breaking up with her. You're not giving her the chance to work through her feelings and find ways to cope with the distance. Instead, you're just giving up. I think you should have a conversation with her about your feelings and concerns, and see if you can find a way to make it work. It's not easy, but it's worth it if you truly care about each other."
4. **u/realisticviews**: "I think you're being too dramatic about this. You're not going to break up with her because of a few months of distance. You're going to make it work, and you're going to come out stronger on the other side. You're not doing this for her, you're doing it for yourself. You're not willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work, and you're using her pain as an excuse. Instead of breaking up with her, why not try to find ways to make the distance more manageable? You could schedule regular video calls, send surprise gifts, or even plan visits when you can. It's not easy, but it's worth it if you truly care about her."

**Common themes:**

* The importance of communication and honesty in relationships
* The need to consider one's own feelings and desires in the relationship
* The potential consequences of breaking up, including causing more pain and uncertainty
* The importance of finding ways to make the distance more manageable and workable
* The need to prioritize the relationship and make an effort to make it work, rather than giving up easily.

Never posted on Reddit before at all, but I figured (based on the overall reliability of you nice individuals) that now would be a good time to start. 

About a year ago I moved away from my Midwest town to the west coast for work, and have just recently moved back. I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. 

I am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that. I was alarmed however when  I was told that the value was around $500.00 from a home that I shared with friends in college. They stated that this amount was accrued in 2013.

I have spent the last 3 days trying to find the exact time when we moved from that specific house ( it was college, so we had a new place basically every year) and just now found out that the lease was over on 05/31/2012. Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously "managed" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). 

My question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have? I cannot afford to pay it, but I also don't think that it should be on me TO pay it. Any advice is truly appreciated as I have not had any experience with this type of thing before.

TL;DR: Owing $500 in past utility bills from a college house I shared with friends, but it was 2012 and I didn't request cancellation. Am I really on the hook for this and what can I do?

---

**ADVICE FROM REDDIT**

1. **Contact the utility company**: Reach out to the utility company and explain the situation. Provide them with the lease end date and any documentation you have to support your claim. They may be willing to work with you to come up with a payment plan or even waive the debt.
2. **Check your records**: Review your records and see if you have any documentation that shows you didn't request cancellation of the utility services. This could be a letter, email, or even a phone call record.
3. **Talk to your friends**: Reach out to your friends who lived with you in the college house and see if they have any recollection of the situation. They may be able to provide additional information or corroborate your story.
4. **Consider a dispute resolution process**: If the utility company is unwilling to work with you, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in your state. They may be able to help mediate the situation and come up with a resolution.
5. **Don't ignore the issue**: It's important to address the issue head-on and not ignore it. Ignoring the debt may lead to further consequences, such as damage to your credit score or even a lawsuit.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS**

* Make sure to keep a record of all communication with the utility company, including dates, times, and details of conversations.
* Consider hiring a collections attorney if you're unable to resolve the issue with the utility company.
* If you're unable to pay the debt, you may want to consider negotiating a settlement with the utility company. They may be willing to accept a lump sum payment or a payment plan that's more manageable for you.

**CONCLUSION**

The key to resolving this issue is to communicate with the utility company and provide them with documentation to support your claim. Don't be afraid to ask for help and consider seeking the assistance of a collections attorney if necessary. Remember to keep a record of all communication and stay proactive in resolving the issue. Good luck!

TITLE: Any hope for the elusive lesbian man? (20 M/MtF)

POST: For most of my life I was pretty hopeless about dating, mostly because I could not be myself when with women; I put on a man act because I was afraid of losing their interest.

I thought I was gay, but the only thing I'm missing is an enjoyment for sex with men.  I've tried it many times and couldn't stay hard.  I was resigned to being a foreveralone with no hope and I was pretty hopeless about life.

I used to joke to myself about being a lesbian in a man's body, but it turns out that's not far from the truth.  I'm going to be transitioning and living as a female in the next 6-12 months with the help of hormones and a lot of work, but I feel like I am unable to form meaningful relationships with women in the mean time.

I don't find straight women that appealing because they prefer, and expect, masculinity from me and assume the submissive role that I would normally take in a relationship.  But while dating a lesbian girl who assumes the dominant role would be perfect, they don't find me attractive now and may lesbians seem to have a militant aversion to trans women.

It seems that either I somehow must act masculine and have women attracted to me (hasn't worked, would rather play in traffic) or I be myself and no one will want me for at least another 1-2 years when I presumably pass as a woman at some level.  How can I make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time?

TL;DR: I'm a 20-year-old MtF trans woman who's struggling to form meaningful relationships with women because I'm not yet passing as a woman and I don't find straight women appealing. I'm looking for advice on how to make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time.

**Comments:**

1. **u/lesbian_lady88**: "Hey, I'm a lesbian and I just wanted to say that it's not uncommon for us to be attracted to trans women. I know it's not the same as being attracted to a cis woman, but it's still a valid attraction. You might be surprised to find that there are women out there who are open to dating trans women. Just be yourself and don't be afraid to express your feelings. And remember, attraction is not just about physical appearance, it's about the person inside too."
2. **u/queer_ally**: "I'm a queer ally and I just wanted to say that it's amazing that you're being honest about your feelings and desires. It takes a lot of courage to be yourself, especially when you're not yet comfortable with your gender identity. I think it's great that you're looking for ways to connect with women and form meaningful relationships. Just remember that everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another. Don't be discouraged if it takes time to find someone who is a good match for you. And don't be afraid to reach out to queer communities and organizations for support and guidance."

TITLE: Me 26M I haven't met anyone else after my live-in ex two years ago

POST: She was my first serious long term partner and eventually cheated on me.  Our breakup was shitty, and we didn't really remain friends.

It took a while to "get over it" but since then I knew I was ready and open to date someone new.  I really wanted to be in love again and find someone I could share my life with. But in the two years I've been single: I just haven't. 

It sucks, because I see tons of attractive women, I meet lots of interesting people, and I know rationally there are a lot of people out there that would make good matches.  So it doesn't make any sense to me why I haven't been able to meet anyone that I've felt romantic about in longer than I can remember.

At this point I feel like I've kind of resigned myself against the possibility of meeting anyone anytime soon.  I've had FWB's, dated a few people for a while, but just haven't dated anyone that I've felt a romantic connection with.

For the past year, I tried to just not put any pressure on it and just let it happen.  But at the same time, it seems like it's starting to feel like it's been a long time, and at this point I'd really like to love someone.

Anyway, at my current trajectory, I could easily see myself going down this path for the next five or ten years.  I'm not really sure what to do.  I lift weights and am in pretty good shape, but I don't really seem to attract the kind of people I'm attracted to (so basically, attractive women, making me like every other dude).

Anyway, I thought about this because recently my ex friended me on facebook and, while it wasn't a serious thing (she's had a new bf for a while now), I wrote her last week just to catch up and she immediately unfriended me and never replied.  I kind of sat there thinking like "man.  My love life is such shit.  All I have after the last two years is the hope of friendship with a woman who wants nothing to do with me, and I still can't find anyone I'm attracted to to date."

TL;DR: I'm 26, haven't met anyone I'm romantically interested in in two years, despite being open to dating and meeting new people.  I'm starting to feel like I'll be single forever and I'm not sure what to do.

**Comments:**

* "Dude, you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax and focus on being a good person. The right person will come along when the time is right."
* "I feel you, bro. I went through a similar thing after my first serious relationship ended. It took me a while to get over it, but eventually I started focusing on myself and my own happiness. I started taking up new hobbies, joined a gym, and started volunteering. It helped me meet new people and get out of my comfort zone. Maybe try something similar?"
* "I think you're being too focused on finding someone who's 'attractive' to you. Instead, try to focus on finding someone who shares your values and interests. You might be surprised at how much more fulfilling a relationship can be when you connect with someone on a deeper level."
* "Have you considered online dating? It can be a great way to meet new people who share your interests and values. Just be honest and authentic in your profile, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there."
* "I think you're putting too much emphasis on physical attraction. Instead, focus on finding someone who is kind, genuine, and has a good heart. Those are the qualities that will make a relationship truly fulfilling."
* "I'm a woman, and I have to say, I find it really refreshing to see a guy who is honest and vulnerable about his feelings. Keep being yourself, and the right person will come along when the time is right."
* "I think you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to take your time and focus on yourself. You don't have to be in a relationship to be happy. Maybe try to focus on your own personal growth and development, and see where that takes you."

TITLE: TIFU by renting my apartment to the weedman

POST: Last week I rented 1 out of 2 rooms to my weedman and his girlfriend. It was only supposed to be till the end of September. 

Sunday noon this guys calls me and tells me 
"Hey man, my girlfriend left me. I'm not going to stay at apartment anymore, I want my money back!"

I don't really have backup funds for emergency situations like this due to the fact that I just started working as an apprentice one year ago. My mother pays for the apartment.

Now here is where the fuck up happened. He payed me around 500€ for one month. The rent was already payed and I decided to spent the money on clothes, electronics, booze and of course some herbs. And I also didn't tell my mother about. 

This dude has the key for the main lock to the apartment. Unfortunately this is a universal key. He can open the door to the building, to my mail and the door. Fortunately I didn't give the key for the second lock. 

After trying to tell him that I don't have his money, he went berserk. He threatened me via text and phone calls. 

I panicked. Closed both locks. Went to my parents house, because I didn't really felt safe there anymore. My parents are out of town till the end of September and I beg to God that I can sort this situation out. 

My mother will probably kill me if she finds out, the dealer most likely too. Drugs are bad mkay kids?

TL;DR: I rented a room to a weedman and his girlfriend, spent the rent money on stuff I shouldn't have, and now the guy is threatening me because I don't have his money back. I'm in a bit of a pickle.

---

**Comments:**

* "TIFU by not having a backup plan and not telling your mom about the rent money"
* "You should've just told him you didn't have the money and offered to help him find a new place"
* "Why did you spend the rent money on clothes and electronics? You knew it was only supposed to be temporary"
* "You're in a bit of a pickle, but you're also a bit of a dumbass"
* "I would've just given him back the money and told him to leave. You don't have to deal with his drama"
* "You should've just been honest with your mom from the start. Now you're in a mess"
* "I hope you learn from this experience and don't make the same mistake again"

---

**Moral of the story:** Don't spend rent money on frivolous things, and always have a backup plan. Honesty is the best policy, especially when dealing with shady characters. And for the love of all things good, don't rent a room to a weedman.

TITLE: TIFU by standing up to the school jerk.

POST: I am a college student in a very small Institute. (Graduation class of less than 50) Well there is this particular guy who is the biggest jerk of the school. He has to "one up" everybody and is constantly demeaning and disrespectful. 

Well, this particular discussion began over the recent tragedy involving Robin Williams death.

He had mentioned the incident and said that those who take their own lives are "Shameless Cowards" and those people shouldn't waste time on Earth if they can't handle life. Also the families and loved ones of those individuals should be ashamed and embarrassed.

I then was very upset and told him that I have had people very close to me take their own lives, and You can imagine what that person must have been dealing with. He proceeded to say they were simply weak. At this point I went off and can't remember everything that was said. Well a nosey student went and told a director that I was Verbally assaulting an innocent student. (of course) this student was an underclassmen who did not know the situation nor the history of this person. They also lied and exaggerated the story.

I was called into a meeting where I was suspended for the next 3 days. Upon my return on Monday I have a meeting with the program Director to discuss further repercussions, aka Expulsion from a College I have paid to go to. 

This college is a joke. The teachers act like high school students and gossip like no teenage I've ever met. the favoritism and exaggeration is outrageous. I am being threatened with expulsion on the false grounds of bulling with no proof of the entire incident and the guy that was involved didn't even come forward to complain about it because it was simply a heated discussion in which were both involved.

I guess the lesson here is, You can't stand up to Bullies because you look like a bully and then are kicked from a bullshit college that you have paid $30,000 to attend.

TL;DR: I stood up to a school jerk who made a comment about suicide and was suspended for 3 days with the threat of expulsion. The college is a joke and I'm being punished for standing up for myself.

---

This post has received over 12,000 upvotes and over 2,000 comments. The majority of the comments are in support of the OP and are outraged by the college's handling of the situation. Many users have shared their own experiences of being bullied or marginalized, and have expressed solidarity with the OP. Some users have also offered advice on how to handle the situation, such as seeking support from a counselor or talking to a trusted professor.

The post has also sparked a larger conversation about the importance of mental health awareness and the need for colleges to provide adequate support for students who are struggling. Many users have shared their own experiences of struggling with mental health issues, and have expressed gratitude for the OP's bravery in speaking out about the issue.

Overall, the post has received a overwhelmingly positive response, and has sparked a important conversation about mental health awareness and the need for colleges to provide adequate support for students.

TITLE: Me[19M] with my Girlfriend [19F] of 3 years, She is unsure if our relationship is worth saving - Help

POST: Hey guys,

me and my girlfriend had been together for about 1 year when i started to ignore her problems and be a bit selfish, denying that we had problems and letting my own insecurities out on our relationship.
This carried on for another year and she put up with it.

at the moment we currently aren't together and she kind of likes another guy, goes out with him and hang around together, she says that she still loves me and wants me to show her that we're worth saving but i really don't know what to do.
(I'm quite emotionally naive with these kind of things)

At the moment i really don't know what i should do, if i should fight for our relationship and show her that we're worth saving, or just move on with my life without her.
I'm pretty much at rock bottom at the moment

She is literally my whole world and has been for the past 3 years

Please help Reddit

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend of 3 years have been having problems, I've been selfish and ignored her issues, she's unsure if our relationship is worth saving, and I'm unsure what to do.

---

**Comments:**

1. **throwaway123456**: OP, it sounds like you've been pretty toxic in your relationship. I'm not saying you're a bad person, but you've definitely contributed to the problems. If you want to save the relationship, you need to take responsibility for your actions and work on being a better partner. That means listening to her, validating her feelings, and making amends for your past behavior. It's not going to be easy, but it's the only way to move forward.
2. **relationship_guru**: OP, it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your actions and consider what you can do to improve the relationship. However, it's also important to consider whether or not you're truly compatible with your girlfriend. If you've been selfish and ignored her issues for years, it's possible that you're not the right partner for her. You need to think about what you want out of a relationship and whether or not you're willing to put in the work to make it better.
3. **sad_panda**: OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're really struggling and unsure of what to do. I think it's great that you're considering what you want and what's best for you. However, I also think it's important to remember that you can't force someone to stay in a relationship if they're not happy. If your girlfriend is unsure if the relationship is worth saving, it's possible that it's not meant to be. You need to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, and if that means moving on, then so be it.
4. **relationship_coach**: OP, it sounds like you're at a crossroads in your relationship. I would recommend taking some time to reflect on what you want and what you're willing to do to make the relationship better. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and you need to be willing to work together to make it better. If you're not sure what to do, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support as you navigate this difficult time.

---

**Reddit's advice:**

* Take responsibility for your actions and work on being a better partner
* Consider whether or not you're truly compatible with your girlfriend
* Prioritize your own happiness and well-being
* Communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns
* Consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor

**Key takeaways:**

* OP needs to take responsibility for his actions and work on being a better partner
* OP needs to consider whether or not he's truly compatible with his girlfriend
* OP needs to prioritize his own happiness and well-being
* OP needs to communicate openly and honestly with his girlfriend about his feelings and concerns
* OP may need to seek the help of a couples therapist or counselor to navigate this difficult time.

TITLE: Does debit card insufficient funds fee affect my credit in any way?

POST: First time posting on Reddit and on mobile, formatting might be a problem.
Yesterday, I checked my bank account online after my card was not accepted for a payment. Turns out I have a balance of -$60 on my debit card because of a purchase done on a subscription I didn't even know I had subscribed to. I only had 0.23¢ (irresponsible, I know) on my bank account, and the subscription costed $12. So apart from the $12 fee, I got an overdraft fee of -$34, and another more for -$15 after not paying the first fee a week after I got it. So now I have a $60 fee, and I have no idea if it will affect my credit or my debit in any way. I do not have a credit card, I have never had any, and I plan to pay the debt today. Will this fee affect me and my credit in any way?

TL;DR: I got an overdraft fee of -$60 on my debit card, and I'm worried if it will affect my credit score or debit card account in any way.

REPLIES:

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Hey OP, don't worry about it too much. The overdraft fee will not affect your credit score, as it's a debit card issue. However, it's still a good idea to pay it off as soon as possible to avoid any further fees. You can also consider setting up overdraft protection on your account to avoid this in the future."
2. **u/financialfreedom**: "OP, you're lucky it's not a credit card! Overdraft fees on debit cards are usually just a debit card issue and won't affect your credit score. However, it's still important to pay it off ASAP to avoid further fees. Consider setting up overdraft protection and also review your bank's policies on overdraft fees to avoid this in the future."
3. **u/credit_karma**: "Hey OP, just to clarify, overdraft fees on debit cards are usually just a debit card issue and won't affect your credit score. However, if you have a credit card and you're not paying your bills on time, it can affect your credit score. So, make sure to pay off your debit card overdraft fee ASAP and also consider setting up overdraft protection to avoid this in the future."
4. **u/personalfinancepro**: "OP, don't worry about it too much. Overdraft fees on debit cards are usually just a debit card issue and won't affect your credit score. However, it's still important to pay it off ASAP to avoid further fees. Consider setting up overdraft protection and also review your bank's policies on overdraft fees to avoid this in the future. Also, consider setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account to avoid overspending and avoid overdraft fees in the future."

---

This post and its replies demonstrate the importance of understanding the difference between credit and debit accounts. The OP is concerned about the overdraft fee on their debit card affecting their credit score, but the replies clarify that overdraft fees on debit cards are usually just a debit card issue and won't affect their credit score. The replies also provide advice on how to avoid overdraft fees in the future, such as setting up overdraft protection and reviewing bank policies on overdraft fees. The post and its replies highlight the importance of financial literacy and responsible financial management.

TITLE: Can I legally shut down someone's social media accounts if it is giving me a bad rep?

POST: My first and last name is pretty unique. I only get about ~500 page results when I Google my name. Recently, some idiot who apparently has the same full name as me (i have no idea who he is) opened up twitter and facebook accounts under his name so that when I search for my name on Google, the first page contains links to all of his accounts, which have the same name as me. Now, I usually would have no problem with this. The problem that I have is that (1) all of his posts talk about him doing drugs, smoking weed, drinking, partying (2) he has pornography all over his social media accounts (3) several pornographic websites of his account appear. (4) he says a lot of racist stuff that I don't agree with (5) and every other word is a curse word. I'm completely the opposite of this, and this obviously does not give me a good name considering that I'm in my second year of university and am starting to look for jobs soon. I'm worried employers would see it and automatically reject me.  Can I sue him for defamation? I've tried reporting the accounts, but I failed because twitter and facebook say that  I do not have rights to take down his account. Is there anything that I can do?

TL;DR: Someone with the same name as me is posting offensive content on social media, giving me a bad rep. Can I legally shut down his accounts or sue him for defamation?

**Legal Advice:**

The OP's situation is a classic case of "cyber identity theft" or "cyber impersonation." While it's understandable that the OP wants to take action, the legal options are limited. Here's a breakdown of the potential legal avenues:

1. **Defamation:** The OP may have a claim for defamation if the posts in question are false and harm the OP's reputation. However, the burden of proof lies with the OP to show that the posts are false and that the defendant (the person with the same name) intended to harm the OP's reputation. This can be a challenging and costly legal process.
2. **Trademark infringement:** If the OP has a trademark registered for their name, they may have a claim for trademark infringement. However, this would require the OP to show that the defendant's use of their name is likely to confuse consumers or dilute the value of the trademark.
3. **Cyber harassment:** The OP may also have a claim for cyber harassment if the defendant's posts are intended to harass or intimidate the OP. However, this would require the OP to show that the defendant's actions are intended to cause emotional distress or harm.

**What the OP can do:**

1. **Report the accounts:** The OP should continue to report the accounts to Twitter and Facebook, as they have already done. While the platforms may not be able to remove the accounts, reporting them can help to reduce the visibility of the offensive content.
2. **Contact the defendant:** The OP may want to try to contact the defendant and ask them to remove the offensive content. This can be done through social media or by sending a formal letter.
3. **Seek legal advice:** The OP should consult with a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property or cyber law to discuss their options and determine the best course of action.
4. **Monitor online presence:** The OP should regularly monitor their online presence to ensure that the defendant's accounts are not causing harm to their reputation.

**Conclusion:**

While the OP's situation is frustrating and concerning, the legal options are limited. The OP should focus on reporting the accounts, contacting the defendant, and seeking legal advice to determine the best course of action. It's also important for the OP to monitor their online presence and take steps to protect their reputation. Remember that the internet is a public space, and it's difficult to completely remove content once it's been posted. However, by taking proactive steps, the OP can minimize the impact of the defendant's actions and protect their reputation.

TITLE: I (20F) was a horrible person in a relationship because of my past

POST: My boyfriend (19M)  broke up with me (20F), after an 8 month relationship, a little over a month ago. The break up was bad. I was hysterical and acted like a child. At first I did not know why he had broken up with me (his answers to my questions were not very clear). 

After a while, and a little soul searching, I realized that out relationship fell apart because of my need to be in control. I was constantly nagging him to do things and I constantly micro-managed not only my life, but also his. 

I have been going to counseling ever since the break up. It has made me realize that my behavior comes from a controlling parent. I do not want to be controlling and am working on living life without worry about something not going right. So far, I am actually enjoying my life more than I have in a very long time.

I had not thought about my ex for quite a while. About a week after the break up I decided that it was time for me to pull my life back together. Now that I am feeling much better, I have started thinking about him again. I would like to try again in a relationship with him. I am sure he is angry and hurt by the way I treated him. I do not want to have the same relationship we had because if it did not work once, it is not going to work again. I could go give him  the whole "I've changed" speech, but I feel like I need to say something different than that. I do not know what to do to try and win him back, and let him know I actually want to have a good, healthy relationship.

TL;DR: I was a controlling person in my 8 month relationship and it ended. I've been in counseling and have been working on changing. I want to try again with my ex, but I don't know how to approach him and make him know I've changed.

---

This post is a great example of a person taking responsibility for their actions and acknowledging the harm they caused in their previous relationship. The OP (original poster) is aware that their controlling behavior was a major factor in the break-up and is actively working on changing themselves. They are also showing a willingness to learn and grow, which is a great sign.

The OP is seeking advice on how to approach their ex and make them aware of the changes they've made. They are not looking for a "get out of jail free" card or an easy way to win their ex back, but rather a genuine opportunity to make things right and start anew.

The community's response to this post is overwhelmingly supportive and encouraging. Many users offer words of wisdom, sharing their own experiences and insights on how to approach the situation. Some suggestions include:

* Being honest and open with your ex about your past behavior and the changes you've made
* Showing your ex that you're committed to personal growth and self-improvement
* Giving your ex space and time to process their feelings and reflect on the relationship
* Focusing on building a new connection with your ex, rather than trying to recreate the past

Overall, this post is a great example of how the r/relationships community can provide a safe and supportive space for people to share their stories and seek advice on how to navigate complex relationships.

POST: My friends finally decided to invite me out for a night out, I usually hang out with this group but the only thing is that they're all planning to sleep over at someones house who I'm not to familiar with. They're all close to these people living in the house, but I would feel extremely uncomfortable staying there. I'm not even sure if he's okay with it, my friends just told me that they were going too.
I don't have anywhere else to stay because we're going to a different city (college campus), I want to go out with them, but I'm not sure. I'm hyperventilating just thinking about it...

TL;DR: Invited to a night out with friends, but I'm extremely anxious about staying over at someone's house I'm not familiar with. I don't have anywhere else to stay and I really want to go out with them.

**ADVICE FROM THE SUBREDDIT COMMUNITY:**

1. **Communicate with your friends**: "Hey guys, I really appreciate the invite, but I'm feeling really anxious about staying over at [name]'s house. Can we figure out an alternative? Maybe we can find a hotel or a different place to stay?" Your friends might not have realized how uncomfortable you'd feel and will likely be understanding.
2. **Offer alternatives**: "If we can't find a different place to stay, would it be okay if I just went out with you guys for the night and then went back to my own place? I really don't want to be a downer, but I'm just not feeling comfortable with this."
3. **Prioritize your own comfort**: "It's okay to say no to things that make you uncomfortable. If you're really anxious about staying over at someone's house, it's better to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. You can always suggest alternative plans or activities that make you feel more at ease."
4. **Consider a compromise**: "If you're really set on going out with your friends, but still want to prioritize your own comfort, you could suggest a compromise. For example, you could stay at a hotel or a different place, and then meet up with your friends for the night. This way, you're still spending time with your friends, but you're also taking care of your own needs."
5. **Remember that it's okay to say no**: "It's okay to say no to things that make you uncomfortable. Your friends should understand and respect your boundaries. Remember that your own comfort and well-being are important, and it's okay to prioritize them."

---

**ADDITIONAL TIPS:**

* Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or visualization, to help manage your anxiety.
* Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about your anxiety and how it affects you.
* Remember that it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs.
* Don't be afraid to say no or suggest alternative plans if you're feeling uncomfortable or anxious.

**CONCLUSION:**

It's understandable to feel anxious about staying over at someone's house, especially if you're not familiar with them. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being, and don't be afraid to communicate your concerns with your friends. With a little creativity and compromise, you can still have a fun night out with your friends while also taking care of your own needs.

TITLE: I've lost weight, but I want to tone up and start eating healthy. Before after pics included.

POST: I went from 195 to around 150. 

BACKGROUND: I very recently started working out, but dieting is where I fail. I eat real bad, yesterday for example I had 2 bags of chips, 15ish Hershey kisses, an ice cream sandwich, pizza, and fried chicken. That was a pretty average day,  I've done 2 pints of ice cream no problem, but now I'm trying to slow down on my sugar intake. I don't calorie count. 

Eating right seems to focus on creating healthy yet delicious meals. But that's not me, the tastiness doesn't outweigh the time spent making. I just want to get what I need. Hence why I eat so much fast food and junk. Need x amount of carbs? Drink this it takes no time prepping. Need x amount of protein? Take this pill and you're good for the day. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to take shortcuts, I just don't care for food and the more time needed to make a meal the less likely I'll do it.

TL;DR: I've lost weight, but I want to tone up and start eating healthy. I struggle with dieting and tend to eat a lot of junk food. I'm looking for advice on how to make healthy eating easier and more enjoyable.

PHOTOS: Before and after photos of the author's weight loss journey are included in the post.

RESPONSES:

1. Congratulations on your weight loss! It's great that you're taking the next step to focus on toning up and eating healthy. I completely understand your struggle with dieting, especially when it comes to convenience and taste. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

* Start small: Try incorporating one or two healthy meals into your daily routine, and gradually increase the number of healthy meals as you get more comfortable.
* Find healthy alternatives: Instead of reaching for junk food, try finding healthier alternatives that still satisfy your cravings. For example, you could try making your own trail mix with nuts and dried fruit instead of buying a bag of chips.
* Meal prep: I know you mentioned you don't like spending a lot of time in the kitchen, but meal prep can be a game-changer. Try setting aside one day a week to prep healthy meals for the next few days. You can find plenty of easy and quick recipes online that require minimal cooking time.
* Seek support: Having a support system can make a big difference in your journey. Consider finding a workout buddy or joining a healthy eating community online to stay motivated and accountable.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – just get back on track and keep moving forward.

2. I completely understand where you're coming from. I used to be the same way – always reaching for the quick and easy option, even if it wasn't the healthiest choice. But over time, I've learned that it's worth taking a little extra time to prepare healthy meals. Here are a few tips that have worked for me:

* Keep it simple: Don't feel like you need to make a complicated, multi-course meal every night. Simple meals like grilled chicken and veggies or a hearty salad with protein can be just as satisfying and healthy.
* Plan ahead: Take some time on the weekends to plan out your meals for the week. This can help you avoid last-minute takeout or fast food runs.
* Find healthy convenience foods: Just because you're trying to eat healthier doesn't mean you have to give up convenience. Look for healthy convenience foods like pre-cut veggies, pre-cooked chicken, or overnight oats that can make meal prep a breeze.
* Make it a habit: Try to make healthy eating a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine. For example, you could make a healthy breakfast every morning or have a healthy snack after lunch.

Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – just get back on track and keep moving forward.

3. Congratulations on your weight loss! It's great that you're taking the next step to focus on toning up and eating healthy. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

* Try a meal delivery service: There are plenty of meal delivery services out there that can provide you with healthy, pre-prepared meals. This can be a great way to get started with healthy eating and avoid the temptation of junk food.
* Find healthy recipes online: There are plenty of healthy recipes online that can help you get started with meal prep. Try searching for recipes that use ingredients you already have on hand and that can be prepared in under 30 minutes.
* Make healthy swaps: Try making healthy swaps in your favorite recipes. For example, you could try using whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta or using avocado instead of mayonnaise.
* Seek support: Having a support system can make a big difference in your journey. Consider finding a workout buddy or joining a healthy eating community online to stay motivated and accountable.

Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – just get back on track and keep moving forward.

TITLE: Friend put me down as a personal reference for a car loan. What should I do?

POST: Someone I hang out with but that I don't know very well put me down as a personal reference for a car loan, and the dealership (a national chain known for financing people with bad credit) called and left me a voicemail to call them back. I have never had to put down a personal reference for a car loan, and I don't know why they are calling me. What type of information are they looking for? (I am definitely NOT cosigning or anything like that; this was out of the blue.)

For the record, I don't know this friend very well. He tells a lot of tall tales about his family and claims to own a luxury car and a house "back home" in another city but seems to be just barely scraping by here. He also recently started his own business, but I have no idea how well it may or may not be doing financially.

So I guess if I called the car dealership back, I wouldn't have anything good to say about his financial situation. To me, it seems like he has no money, but I don't want to tank his chance at getting a car. Should I call back and lie, call back and tell the truth, or just not call back at all?

TL;DR: Friend put me down as a personal reference for a car loan without my consent, and the dealership is calling me. What do I do?

**Top comments:**

1. **u/throwaway1234567**: "Don't call back. This is a huge red flag. Your friend is trying to use you to get a loan and is willing to compromise your relationship with you to do so. You don't owe him anything, and you shouldn't feel obligated to help him out. If you do call back, you're basically cosigning for him, which is a huge risk. Just block his number and move on."
2. **u/financialwizard**: "I'd call back and tell them you're not comfortable being a personal reference. You can say something like, 'I'm happy to help my friend out, but I'm not comfortable being a personal reference for a car loan. I don't know his financial situation well enough to vouch for him.' This way, you're not lying, but you're also not burning your friend's bridges. Just be firm and polite, and they should respect your decision."
3. **u/anonymoususer123**: "I'd call back and tell them the truth. You don't have to sugarcoat it, but you also don't have to be mean. You can say something like, 'Hey, I'm not really familiar with my friend's financial situation, and I don't think I'd be a good reference for him. Can you please remove my name from the list?' They might be able to work with you to find another reference, or they might be able to offer alternative financing options. Either way, you're being honest and upfront, and you're not putting your friend's loan at risk."
4. **u/throwawayaccount99**: "Don't call back at all. If your friend is willing to use you like this, he's not a good friend. You don't owe him anything, and you shouldn't feel guilty about not wanting to help him out. Just block his number and move on. You deserve better than a friend who would put you in this kind of situation."

TITLE: He doesn't trust me because he's cheating on me. Duh.

POST: Seriously, I'm an idiot for getting myself into this.

When I fall in love I just automatically give the person the benefit of the doubt, and my trust. Y'know, I thought if you love someone then that automatically means you should be able to trust them. If he tells me he doesn't trust me because he's scared, I'd just believe that shit without a second thought. 

Am I really that much of an idiot to just believe that? This guy is totally fucking around, I can't believe I'd be stupid enough to believe otherwise just because of love and just because *I'm* faithful. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

But now, I'm just going to numb myself out. I'm really good at that. I'm going to constantly assume the worst. I'm going to allow myself to keep falling in love with him (because honestly I couldn't stop myself if I tried) and I'm going to stay just as faithful as I've been this entire time, *but I'm not trusting him for shit*. Fuck that.

I already know what's coming. I've probably been getting played since the beginning, and I'm definitely being played now. I'd be a fucking idiot to think this guy actually loves me. 

I mean really, why did I think I was special? What made me think I was so special that he would want to be with me exclusively? I only believed it because that's what I wanted, but what the fuck? Could I be a bigger fucking idiot? Damn.

I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. Sooner or later it'll get more obvious that I'm being used and I'll be discarded, or the betraying will become apparent. Whatever comes first. So at least for now I can love him without being fully aware of how I'm being fucked.

It'll actually be cool to get my heart broken because then I can really numb out. Any faith I have in people would be sucked out and replaced with cold detachment. I'll shut people out of my heart in the name of defense. If I don't trust anyone to begin with, then they would have no chance to fuck me over. Awesome.

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with someone who's cheating on me, and I'm still trusting him because I'm an idiot. I'm going to keep loving him, but I'm not going to trust him. I'm going to assume the worst and keep my heart numb. I'm going to get my heart broken, and I'm going to use it as an excuse to shut people out of my heart forever. Yay.

TITLE: Me [27F] my long term boyfriend [30 M) of 2 years lied about using dating sites.

POST: I recently discovered my boyfriend of over 2 years has been logging onto a dating site daily. We had spoken before about this account a few months into our relationship and agreed that as long as it wasnt being used there was no reason to deactivate it. 

A year later i logged into mine to  look at a friends potential date, and saw he was online. I went back the next day and there he was again. Over the next few weeks i checked in daily and he was online up to 3 times a day. I mentioned I saw him on there and he lied to me, saying it was once off answering a friend. He got angry that I brought it up and accused me of being paranoid and untrusting, and that he would have to shut it down because of my issues and i securities.
 I havent told him yet that I know he lied, Im trying to come to terms with his response and not blow up. I genuinly dont believe he is cheating on me, but the fact he is browsing other women, and choosing to lie to me and put me down instead of admit it is a huge red flag, and not in line with the love he claims to have for me. I feel disrespected and upset that my relationship is not based on honesty like I thought. I have just left a job to move across the country to be with him, and now Im unsure about my decision. He knows honesty is non negotiable with me, this has seriously damaged my idea of our relationship.
Any advise or insights?
*Ive never been insecure or untrusting in relationships. Wondering If Im picking up on something this time round?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 2 years has been using a dating site daily, lied to me about it, and got angry when I confronted him. I'm unsure what to do and feel disrespected and upset. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?*

**Comments:**

* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for him to lie to you and make you feel like you're being paranoid. You deserve better than that. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with him about how his actions have made you feel?"
* "I'm not surprised you're feeling unsure about your decision to move across the country. It's a huge step, and now you're questioning whether it was the right one. Take some time to think about what you want and what you're willing to accept in your relationship. You deserve to be with someone who respects and values you."
* "I think you're being way too understanding. He lied to you, and that's a huge red flag. You don't owe him an explanation or an apology for being upset. You deserve to be treated with honesty and respect, and if he can't provide that, then maybe it's time to reevaluate the relationship."
* "I think you should take a step back and assess the relationship as a whole. Has he been consistently honest with you throughout the relationship? Have there been other instances where he's lied or been dishonest? If so, then maybe this is a sign of a deeper issue. You deserve to be with someone who values honesty and integrity."
* "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not okay for him to lie to you and make you feel like you're being paranoid. You deserve better than that. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you work through your feelings and figure out what you want to do next."

**Key Takeaways:**

* The OP is feeling disrespected and upset due to her boyfriend's dishonesty and lack of transparency.
* The OP is unsure what to do and is questioning her decision to move across the country to be with him.
* The comments suggest that the OP should have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about how his actions have made her feel, and that she deserves to be treated with honesty and respect.
* Some commenters suggest that the OP should take a step back and assess the relationship as a whole, considering whether there have been other instances of dishonesty or lack of transparency.
* The comments also suggest that the OP should consider seeking therapy to work through her feelings and figure out what she wants to do next.

TITLE: I [M24] have been dating F[20] over summer and don't want to continue seeing her romantically. She is very attached to me. How can I let her down easy?

POST: I've been seeing a girl over the summer. Shes really sweet but has been giving hints she wants to make our relationship official.  I've given it some thought and I decided I don't want to take it to that level with her.  Like I said, she is really nice, but we're in different places in life and I just have a gut feeling that I don't want to take it any further.  She has gotten really attached to me though and I know this is going to crush her.  She also lost one of her parents recently which makes the whole situation worse.  I've been in a shitty place too so we've been really helping each other emotionally.  So some part of me really doesn't want to do this since I'll be more emotionally isolated, as well as her.  I would love to keep things casual, but I don't think that would be healthy for her since I'm afraid she would say yes with the hope I would change my mind.

How can I let her down easy, or as much as possible given the situation?  Is it possible for us to still be there for each other after the dust settles?

TL;DR: I've been dating a girl over summer, but I don't want to take it further. She's really attached and has been through a tough time with her parent's passing. I want to let her down easy, but I'm worried about her feelings and our emotional connection.

---

**Top comments:**

* "Be honest with her, but also be kind. Let her know that you value your emotional connection, but you don't feel the same way romantically. You can still be friends and support each other, but it's important to be clear and respectful."
* "It's okay to prioritize your own feelings and needs, but also be aware of the impact your decision will have on her. Consider having a conversation with her about your feelings and boundaries, and be prepared to listen to her perspective as well."
* "It's not selfish to prioritize your own emotional well-being, but it's also important to be considerate of her feelings. You could say something like, 'Hey, I've been thinking a lot about our relationship and I don't feel like it's the right fit for me. I value our connection and I want to support you, but I don't think we're compatible in a romantic sense.'"
* "It's okay to say no to someone you care about, but it's also important to be respectful and kind. You could say something like, 'I really appreciate you and I value our friendship, but I don't feel like we're a good match romantically. I hope you can understand and we can still be friends.'"
* "It's not about being 'nice' or'mean', it's about being honest and respectful. You can still be kind and compassionate while also being clear about your feelings and boundaries. Remember that you can't control how she reacts, but you can control how you approach the conversation."

TITLE: Reddit, need help against my Catholic ex-roommate

POST: Reddit,
I moved in with a good friend of mine in November of last year. Before moving in with me he knew I was gay. However in February he told me that he became very religious (joined Knights of Columbus) and could no longer live with me. He asked me to 'control myself' until November at lease end or he would have to move out. 

I never had anyone over while he was at the residence and you would never know I was gay unless I told you. This all started because I had a straight friend over and the entire time he 'freaked out' thinking of what I might be doing with him. I was so furious at the time I told him to just move out.

He moved out, I could not find another roommate so we were forced to give notice to the leasing office we would be leaving. He continued to pay bills, rent, etc. 

Here is my problem, there is a $1000 dollar cancellation fee, he is to pay half and I have to pay half. I think it's ridiculous though because he is the one that broke the lease contract on his own accord based on his views, I did not want too. My attorney says the same and says the state will agree with me in small claims court. He sent my roommate a letter stating that he must pay or we will pursue civil law suit action. However no results. 

My attorney is suggesting I send him a letter basically saying 'If you are a true Catholic as you say then you will pay him the money because it's the right thing to do. He suggested I quote some excerpts from the bible. I'm not religious so I'm not too versed on what excerpts I could pull out. 

I would appreciated any help you guys could give me!

TL;DR: Ex-roommate broke lease due to religious beliefs, now refusing to pay cancellation fee. Attorney suggests I appeal to his Catholic values, citing biblical excerpts. Help me find some relevant quotes!

---

This post has sparked a lively discussion on the subreddit, with many users offering their opinions and suggestions. Some users have provided biblical excerpts that may support the idea that it is morally right to pay the cancellation fee, while others have argued that the ex-roommate's actions were discriminatory and that he should not be expected to pay. The post has also sparked a debate about the role of religion in personal relationships and the impact of religious beliefs on everyday life.

Some notable comments include:

* "I think your attorney is trying to appeal to your ex-roommate's sense of morality, but it's a bit of a stretch. I mean, just because someone is a good Catholic doesn't mean they're going to do the right thing. Maybe try a different approach, like explaining how his actions affected you and how he can make it right."
* "I'm not religious, but I do think that the Bible has some relevant passages that could be used to support your argument. For example, Matthew 5:23-24 says 'Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift.' This could be interpreted as saying that it's more important to make things right with your brother than to follow the letter of the law."
* "I think you're being a bit too focused on the religious aspect of this. The real issue here is that your ex-roommate broke the lease and is refusing to pay the cancellation fee. You need to focus on the legal aspects of this and work with your attorney to get a fair resolution. Don't worry too much about what your ex-roommate believes or doesn't believe."
* "I'm a Catholic and I think your ex-roommate's actions were wrong. He had a responsibility to fulfill his obligations under the lease, regardless of his religious beliefs. I would encourage him to take responsibility for his actions and pay the cancellation fee. If he's truly a good Catholic, he should be willing to do the right thing and make things right with you."
